AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement"), dated as of April 20, 2006, is by
and among KCS Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Petrohawk
Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Hawk Nest
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Purchaser").

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company have each approved this Agreement and the merger of the Purchaser
with and into the Company (the "Acquisition Merger" or the "Merger") and the
immediately subsequent merger of the Company with and into Parent (the
"Upstream Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, their
respective stockholders;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Company have entered into voting agreements with each of Floyd
C. Wilson, Stephen W. Herod, Shane M. Bayless, Larry L. Helm, Richard K.
Stoneburner, James W. Christmas, William N. Hahne, Harry Lee Stout, and Joseph
T. Leary, under which such parties have among other things agreed to support
the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Voting
Agreements").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Company has delivered to the Parent Non-Solicitation Agreements executed by
James W. Christmas, William N. Hahne, Harry Lee Stout, Joseph T. Leary and
Frederick Dwyer (the "Non-Solicitation Agreements");

WHEREAS for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Parent, Purchaser and the
Company intend that (a) the Acquisition Merger and the Upstream Merger
shall be treated as a single integrated transaction (together, the
"Integrated Transaction") that will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (b) this Agreement and the Upstream
Merger Agreement will together constitute a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and (c) Parent and the
Company will each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the Upstream
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. At the Effective Time, the
separate existence of Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have
the effect as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the Merger, all the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all the obligations, duties, debts
and liabilities of the Company and Purchaser shall be the obligations,
duties, debts and liabilities of the Surviving Corporation. Immediately after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all action
necessary to consummate the Upstream Merger. 

Section 1.2 Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, as promptly as practicable after the Closing and on the
Closing Date, Purchaser and the Company will cause a certificate of merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") to be duly prepared, executed, acknowledged and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of
State") as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date
and at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State or, subject to the DGCL, such other time as is agreed upon
by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such time is
hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."

Section 1.3 Upstream Merger. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Upstream Merger to occur. There shall be no condition to the
completion of the Upstream Merger other than the completion of
the Acquisition Merger. Nothing contained in any agreement, certificate,
filing or other document related to the Upstream Merger shall in any way
alter, change or amend the provisions of this Agreement, and such agreements,
certificates, filings or other documents shall be consistent in all respects
with this Agreement. The plan of merger and the certificate of merger to be
used in connection with the Upstream Merger shall be substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_, respectively (collectively,
the "Certificate of Upstream Merger"). After the Second Effective Time,
references to "Surviving Corporation" in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer to Parent. 

Section 1.4 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1 and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
6, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Houston time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no
later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (by the party
entitled to waive the condition) of all of the conditions set forth in Article
6 (except for those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions)
(the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Thompson and Knight, LLP, 333 Clay
Street, Suite 3300, Houston, Texas 77002, unless another time, date and/or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Section 1.7 Effect on Capital Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article 1
and Section 2.1, each share of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common
Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries and except for any Dissenting Shares and any
shares of Company Common Stock constituting Company Stock Awards (as defined
in Section 1.8(b) granted pursuant to the Company Option Plans which are
converted pursuant to Section 1.8(b) hereof) shall, by virtue of this
Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive the following
consideration (the "Merger Consideration"): the combination of (x) $9.00 (the
"Per Share Cash Consideration") and (y) 1.65 shares of validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Per Share Stock
Consideration" or the "Exchange Ratio"), subject to adjustment in accordance
with Section 1.7(c).

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article 1 shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration,
(ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c),
and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(e).

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be changed or proposed to be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of the occurrence of or record
date with respect to any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar readjustment, in any such case
within such period, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a
record date within such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the
Per Share Stock Consideration.

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall become authorized unissued stock of Parent.



 

4 (e) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.8 Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Performance Stock Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a "Company Option") which was granted pursuant to any stock
option, purchase or award plan, program or arrangement of the Company as set
forth on Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the
"Company Option Plans"), that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Company Option
(hereafter, "Assumed Option") subject to the terms of the applicable Company
Option Plan and the agreement evidencing the grant thereunder of such Assumed
Option; provided, however, that the (i) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock purchasable upon such exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable under such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Stock
Option Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (ii)
the per share exercise price under such Assumed Option shall be adjusted by
dividing the per share exercise price under such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding
up to the nearest whole cent. For purposes of this Section 1.8, the "Stock
Option Exchange Ratio" shall mean the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio plus (ii)
the result obtained from dividing the Per Share Cash Consideration by the
average of the closing sale prices per share of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq
as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five last trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the case of any Assumed Option, the
exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such Assumed Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such options shall be determined in a manner that complies with Section
424(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and (ii) other than to the
extent that the Company is contractually obligated (including pursuant to the
terms of any Company Option Plan) to accelerate the vesting of any Company
Option, no Company Option shall have accelerated vesting by virtue of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement (whether alone or in
conjunction with any other event). Following the Effective Time, no holder of
a Company Option shall have any right to receive any shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of such option. Rights to acquire shares of restricted stock
pursuant to the Companys Star Program shall be considered performance stock
awards rather than Company Options and shall be governed by Section 1.8(c)
below.

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock (each, a "Company
Stock Award") which was issued pursuant to any Company Option Plans prior to
the Effective Time, including Company Stock Awards under the Star Program,
shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into and exchanged for the



 

5 right to receive restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (i) equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were included in such Company
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Stock
Option Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (ii)
otherwise subject to the terms of the applicable Company Option Plan, the
Star Program if applicable, and the agreement or other document evidencing the
grant of the Company Stock Award. Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the case of any Company Stock Award,
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock held pursuant to such Company
Stock Award and the terms and conditions of vesting of such stock award shall
be determined in a manner that complies with Section 424(a) of the Code and
the regulations thereunder and (ii) other than to the extent the Company is
contractually obligated (including pursuant to the terms of any Company Option
Plan) to terminate the restricted period applicable to such Company Stock
Award, to accelerate the vesting period applicable to such Company Stock
Award or to lift any restrictions with respect to any such Company Stock
Award, the restricted period shall not be terminated, the vesting period shall
not be accelerated and no restrictions shall be lifted with respect to any
such Award by virtue of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(whether alone or in conjunction with any other event). Following the
Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Award or other
compensatory award shall have any right to receive shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of such award.

(c) At the Effective Time, each performance stock award under the Companys
Star Program (each, a "Performance Stock Award") shall cease to represent a
right to receive shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each
such Performance Stock Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (hereafter "Assumed Performance Award") subject to the terms of the
applicable Company Option Plan and the agreement or other document evidencing
the grant thereunder of such Performance Stock Award; provided, however, that
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
Performance Stock Award shall be equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were included in such Performance Stock Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Stock Option Exchange Ratio,
and rounded down to the nearest whole share; and provided further, it is
acknowledged that after the Effective Time, Parents compensation committee
(or its Board of Directors or other appropriate committee thereof) in
accordance with and subject to the existing provisions of the applicable
Company Plan or the Companys Star Program and Section 5.11(h) of this
Agreement shall have the right to make such adjustments to such Plan and the
Companys Star Program as it deems advisable in its sole discretion. Any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the case
of any Assumed Performance Award, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable pursuant to such Assumed Performance Award and the terms and
conditions of vesting of such stock award shall be determined in a manner that
complies with Section 424(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder and
(ii) other than to the extent that the Company is contractually obligated
(including pursuant to the terms of any Company Option Plan) to accelerate the
vesting of any Company Performance Award, no Company Performance Award
shall have accelerated vesting by virtue of the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement (whether alone or in conjunction with any other event).
Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Performance Award or
other compensatory award shall have any right to receive shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of such award.



 

6 (d) The Company (or its Board of Directors or the appropriate committee
thereof, or the President of the Company, if applicable) shall (i) make any
amendments to the terms of the Company Option Plans (including the Companys
Star Program), take all corporate action necessary for the adjustment of
Company Options, Performance Stock Awards and Company Stock Awards, and take
any other actions necessary or appropriate to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.8, and (ii) shall take all reasonable actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time, (x) neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver any shares of
the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of Company Options, Performance Stock Awards or
Company Stock Awards after the Effective Time, and (y) other than as set forth
in this Section 1.8, the Surviving Corporation will not be bound by any
options, rights, awards or other arrangements which would entitle any Person,
other than Parent or Purchaser, to beneficially own shares of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent or receive any payments in respect of such options,
rights, awards or arrangements.

(e) Not later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or
other appropriate form) registering all the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the Assumed Options, Company Stock Awards and the Performance Stock
Awards, and such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be
maintained) as long as any Assumed Option, Company Stock Awards or Performance
Stock Awards remains outstanding. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take such actions necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this Section 1.8, including reservation of sufficient shares of Parent Common
Stock to satisfy the obligations under Company Options and Performance Stock
Awards.

Section 1.9 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which
the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a "Dissenting Share"), if any,
such share will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration. Such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from
the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to
the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting
Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL,
affirmatively withdraws his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares or
lost his right to appraisal and payment for his shares of Company Common
Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares
fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL
or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action
the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for
his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock, and
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute
Dissenting Shares, and each such share of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make
any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to
Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.



 

7 ARTICLE 2

_EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article 2, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash
and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to make pursuant
to this Article 2 all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as is
required by Article 1. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e). The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.1(c)
and 2.1(e), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any
cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with
Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.1(c)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than certificates
representing Company Stock Awards which shall be converted into shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8 hereto) (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for its use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.7 (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by all Certificates then held by
such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.7 and this Article 2, including cash payable in lieu of
any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock



 

8 pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.1(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be
paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.1, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c).

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder until such holder
shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.1.
Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (b)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or
other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled
to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such shares
of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any payments made pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or
Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common
Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any shares of Parent
Common Stock.



 

9 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices per share of Parent
Common Stock on Nasdaq as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 1.7. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit such amount with
the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to
such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment of cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately
bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from
and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock who
have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only
to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in
each case, without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



 

10 (i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

(j) _Shares Held by Company Affiliates_. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor)
shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any "affiliate" of Company
(as identified in Section 2.1(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter) until such
Person shall have delivered to Parent duly executed letters as contemplated
in Section 5.14 hereto.

(k) _Investment of Cash by the Exchange Agent; Return of Certain Funds_. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent on a daily basis; provided, that, no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to
Company stockholders pursuant to the other provisions of this Article 2. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be
paid to Parent. Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.1 to pay for shares of Company
Common Stock for which appraisal rights shall have been perfected shall be
returned to Parent upon demand. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent, provided that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $500 million.

Section 2.2 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason
shall be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), in each case without any interest thereon.

Section 2.3 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Company, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in Parent or the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

Company (the "Company Board"). Except for the Company Required Vote, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the

 



 

14 transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and

its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to or limited by (i)

principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in
a proceeding at law or in equity).

(b) The Company Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary so that
the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL are inapplicable to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for
Section 203 of the DGCL (which has been rendered inapplicable), to the
knowledge of the Company, no "moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or
other antitakeover Laws are applicable to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

cancellation or amendment under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or

in the amount of any compensation or benefit payable pursuant to, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
guarantee, other evidence of Indebtedness, lease, license,

writ, injunction, judgment, settlement, award, decree, statute, law, rule or
regulation (collectively, "Laws") applicable to the Company, any of its

case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or Liens which individually or in the aggregate have not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of Company Material Contracts,
including all Hydrocarbon Contracts, of the Company and its



 

15 Subsidiaries pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may be required
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(whether or not subject to the exception set forth with respect to clauses

appreciation right or other equity-based incentive, severance, termination,
change in control, retention, employment, hospitalization or other medical,
life or other insurance, disability, other welfare, supplemental
unemployment, profit-sharing, pension, or retirement plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, and each other director or employee compensation or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed
to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or by any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of Section 4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or to which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate
is party, whether written or oral, for the benefit of any current or former
officer, employee or director of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate (the "Company Plans"). Section 3.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains the name of the Companys ERISA Affiliates.

(b) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has heretofore delivered to
Parent complete and correct copies of each of the following
documents (including all amendments to such documents), as applicable:

(i) the Company Plan or a written description of any Company Plan not in
writing;

(ii) a copy of the most recent annual report or Internal Revenue Service Form
5500 Series that is required to be filed, including all related reports
required therewith;



 

19 (iii) a copy of (1) the most recent Summary Company Plan Description ("SPD")
required to be prepared and distributed, together with (2) all Summaries of

Code, the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue
Service; and

(vii) all material communications between the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
and any Governmental Entity.

(c) No Company Plan in effect as of the date hereof is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA. No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has
been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that would be reasonably likely to
result in the Company or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any such liability.
Insofar as the representation made in this Section 3.9(c) applies to Sections
4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, such representation is made with
respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made,
or was required to make, contributions during the five-year period ending on
the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the Closing Date. 

(d) None of the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, any of the Company Plans, any
trust created thereunder and, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee or
administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction or has taken or failed to
take any action with respect to a Company Plan in connection with which the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate would be
reasonably likely to be subject to a material civil penalty assessed pursuant
to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975(a)
or (b), 4976 or 4980B of the Code.

(e) All contributions required to be made by the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates with respect to any Company Plan on or prior to the Closing Date
have been timely made or are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company dated as of December 31, 2005 contained in the Specified Company
SEC Documents. Since December 31, 2005 there has been no amendment to,
written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the



 

20 Company or any ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in the terms of employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Plan that would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Company Plan above the level of
expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended
prior to the date hereof.

(f) Each of the Company Plans has been operated and administered by the
Company and its ERISA Affiliates in all material respects in accordance
with applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

(g) With respect to each of the Company Plans that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, the Company has
received a currently effective determination letter from the IRS stating that
it is so qualified, such letter has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred that would be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such qualified status. No fund established under a Company
Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(h) No amounts paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form
of benefits, accelerated cash, property or otherwise) under the Company Plans
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or fail to be deductible for
federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

(i) No Company Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former
employee of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate after
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as
that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full
direct cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or
beneficiary thereof).

(j) There has been no amendment to, or announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. The execution of this Agreement, the
stockholder approval of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other similar
termination payment under any Company Plan, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of, increase the amount or value of or otherwise enhance
any benefit due any such employee, officer or director under any Company Plan,
or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans.

(k) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is
or could become a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



 

21 (l) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
material Litigation by, on behalf of or against any Company Plan by any
participant or former participant (or beneficiary thereof) in such Company
Plan or otherwise involving any such Company Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of circumstances
exists that may reasonably give rise to material Litigation, against the
Company Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Company Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company
Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the U.S. Department of
the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any Company Plan, any participant
or former participant in a Company Plan, or any other party.

(m) No Company Plan is a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Code
Section 413(c) or ERISA Section 4063, 4064 or 4066 or a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. No Company Plan is a multiple
employer welfare arrangement as defined in ERISA Section 3(40). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has
contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute to, a multiemployer plan.

(n) All contributions required to be made under each Company Plan, as of the
date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Company Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Documents prior to the date hereof. None of the Company Plans (as
applicable) has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
ERISA Affiliate of the Company has an outstanding funding waiver. None of the
Company Plans (as applicable) has been required to file information pursuant
to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan
year. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Company Plan (as applicable) or to any
single employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate of the Company pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

Company, (i) there is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the

or action been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or been
filed, commenced, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries alleging any violation of the

in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all Permits necessary for the
ownership, leasing, operation, occupancy and use of the Company Real
Property, the Company Assets and the conduct of their respective businesses as
currently conducted ("Company Permits"), except where the failure to hold such

be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice
that any Company Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in
the ordinary course of business, and the Company has no Knowledge of any
reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal, in each
case except for any such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that
individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not
violate any Company Permit, or result in any termination, modification or
nonrenewal thereof, except in each case for any such violations, terminations,
modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

knowledge of any such material infringement, conflict or other violation.

reports estimating the Companys and its Subsidiaries proved oil and gas
reserves as of December 31, 2005, as prepared by the Company and audited by
Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (the "Company Reserve Report"). To the
Companys Knowledge, the factual, non-interpretive data on which the Company
Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and gas reserves
set forth in the Company Reserve Report (and in any supplement thereto or
update thereof) was accurate in all material respects.

(b) All producing oil and gas wells operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and included in the Company Oil and Gas Properties have been

accordance in all material respects with reasonable, prudent oil and gas field

Subsidiaries in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any
reason (except in the ordinary course of business).

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material
advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of

and, on a net, company-wide basis, the Company is neither underproduced nor
overproduced, in either case, to any material extent, under gas balancing or
similar arrangements.

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have Defensible Title to the Company Oil
and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in
the Company Reserve Report as attributable to interests owned or held by the
Company and its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, except for (i)
Permitted Liens and (ii) Liens associated with obligations reflected in the
Company Reserve Report, if any. The oil and gas leases and other agreements
that provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with operating rights in the oil
and gas properties reflected in the Company Reserve Report are in full force
and effect as to the oil and gas properties reflected in the Company Reserve
Report, and the rentals, royalties and other payments due thereunder have been
properly and timely paid and there is no existing default (or event that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under any of such
oil and gas leases or other agreements, except, in each case, as individually
or in the aggregate has not had, and would not



 

32 be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. To the Companys Knowledge, the gross and net undeveloped acreage of

10-K filed with SEC was correct in all material respects as of the date of
such Form 10-K.

been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries due to
Hydrocarbon production in excess of allowables or similar violations that
could result in curtailment of production after the Closing Date from any unit
or oil and gas properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
any such violations which individually or in the aggregate has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

(g) All books, records and files of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including those pertaining to the Company Oil and Gas Properties, wells and
other assets, those pertaining to the production, gathering, transportation
and sale of Hydrocarbons, and corporate, accounting, financial and employee
records): (a) have been prepared, assembled and maintained in good faith, and
(b) to Companys Knowledge, are accurate in all material respects as they
relate to the subject matter thereof.

(h) None of the material Company Oil and Gas Properties is subject to any
preferential purchase or similar right which would become operative as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the
material Hydrocarbon Contracts contains any rights of the other party or
parties thereto to elect a new operator on any of the material Company Oil
and Gas Properties, which rights would become operative as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company Oil and Gas
Properties are not subject to any tax partnership agreement or provisions
requiring a partnership income tax return to be filed under Subchapter K of
Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
paid all royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens on production due
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Oil and Gas

aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result
in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

45 written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by Parent
or any Parent ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in the terms of employee
participation or coverage under, any Parent Plan that would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Parent Plan above the level of
expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended
prior to the date hereof.

(f) Each of the Parent Plans has been operated and administered by Parent and
its ERISA Affiliates in all material respects in accordance with applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

(g) With respect to each of the Parent Plans that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, Parent has
received a currently effective determination letter from the IRS stating that
it is so qualified, such letter has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, no event has occurred that would be reasonably likely to adversely
affect such qualified status. No fund established under a Parent Plan is
intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(h) No amounts paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form
of benefits, accelerated cash, property or otherwise) under the Parent Plans
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or fail to be deductible for
federal income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

(i) No Parent Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former
employee of Parent, its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate after
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as
that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full
direct cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or
beneficiary thereof).

(j) There has been no amendment to, or announcement by the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Parent Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year. The execution of this Agreement, the
stockholder approval of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former employee,
officer or director of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other similar
termination payment under any Parent Plan, or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting of, increase the amount of or otherwise enhance any
benefit due any such employee, officer or director under any Parent Plan.

(k) To the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has
contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no Parent ERISA Affiliate or any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or could become
a liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.



 

46 (l) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened material
Litigation by, on behalf of or against any Parent Plan by any participant or
former participant (or beneficiary thereof) in such Parent Plan or otherwise
involving such Parent Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably
give rise to material Litigation, against the Parent Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Plans or the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the Parent Plans that could reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
the PBGC, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor,
any Parent Plan, any participant or former participant in a Parent Plan, or
any other party.

(m) No Parent Plan is a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Code
Section 413(c) or ERISA Section 4063, 4064 or 4066 or a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. No Parent Plan is a multiple
employer welfare arrangement as defined in ERISA Section 3(40). Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has contributed
to, or had an obligation to contribute to, a multiemployer plan.

(n) All contributions required to be made under each Parent Plan, as of the
date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Parent Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Documents prior to the date hereof. None of the Parent Plans (as
applicable) has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
ERISA Affiliate of Parent has an outstanding funding waiver. None of the
Parent Plans (as applicable) has been required to file information pursuant to
Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to
provide, security to any Parent Plan (as applicable) or to any single employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code.

Parent Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewal
thereof, except in each case for any such violations, terminations,
modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent.

transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, (c) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with managements general or specific authorization, (d) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences, (e) all information (both financial and non-financial) required
to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (f) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. Parents disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports filed with the SEC under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Parent has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof of internal
control over financial reporting, to the Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (A) any significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in



 

55 Parents internal control over financial reporting. Parent has made available
to the Company true and correct copies of any such disclosures made by
management to Parents auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2003.
Since January 1, 2003 through the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach
of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Parent. Parent has
not granted any waivers with respect to its policies regarding ethical
conduct.

Section 4.21 Oil and Gas.

(a) Parent has furnished the Company prior to the date of this Agreement with
a report estimating Parents and its Subsidiaries proved oil and gas
reserves as of December 31, 2005 as prepared by Netherland, Sewell and
Associates, Inc. (the "Parent Reserve Report"). To the Parents Knowledge, the
factual, non-interpretive data on which the Parent Reserve Report was based
for purposes of estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth in the Parent
Reserve Report (and in any supplement thereto or update thereof) was accurate
in all material respects.

(b) All producing oil and gas wells operated by Parent or its Subsidiaries and
included in the Parent Oil and Gas Properties have been operated and produced
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, drilled, in accordance in all material
respects with reasonable, prudent oil and gas field practices and in
compliance in all material respects with applicable oil and gas leases and
applicable Law. 

(c) All material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from Parent
Oil and Gas Properties are being received by Parent and its Subsidiaries in a
timely manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason (except in the
ordinary course of business).

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material
advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of
production to receive deliveries of Hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and,
on a net, company-wide basis, Parent is neither underproduced nor
overproduced, in either case, to any material extent, under gas balancing or
similar arrangements.

(e) Parent and its Subsidiaries have Defensible Title to all oil and gas
properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report as attributable to interests owned or held by Parent and its
Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, except for (i) Permitted Liens and
(ii) Liens associated with obligations reflected in the Parent Reserve Report,
if any. The oil and gas leases and other agreements that provide Parent and
its Subsidiaries with operating rights in the oil and gas properties
reflected in the Parent Reserve Report are in full



 

56 force and effect as to the oil and gas properties reflected in the Parent
Reserve Report, and the rentals, royalties and other payments due thereunder
have been properly and timely paid and there is no existing default (or event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under any
of such oil and gas leases or other agreements, except, in each case, as
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To Parents
Knowledge, the gross and net undeveloped acreage of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as reported in Parents most recent Form 10-K filed with SEC was
correct in all material respects as of the date of such Form 10-K.

(f) No claim, notice or order from any Governmental Entity or other Person
has been received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries due to Hydrocarbon
production in excess of allowables or similar violations that could result in
curtailment of production after the Closing Date from any unit or oil and gas
properties of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except any such violations
which individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(g) All books, records and files of the Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
those pertaining to the Parent Oil and Gas Properties, wells and other
assets, those pertaining to the production, gathering, transportation and sale
of Hydrocarbons, and corporate, accounting, financial and employee records)
(a) have been prepared, assembled and maintained in good faith, and (b) to
Parents Knowledge, are accurate in all material respects as they relate to
the subject matter thereof.

(h) None of the material Parent Oil and Gas Properties is subject to any
preferential purchase or similar right which would become operative as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the
material Hydrocarbon Contracts contains any rights of the other party or
parties thereto to elect a new operator on any of the material Properties,
which rights should become operative as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and its Subsidiaries have paid all
royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens on production due by Parent
and its Subsidiaries with respect to Parent Oil and Gas Properties, except for
any non-payment of which individually or in the aggregate has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

Section 4.22 Investment Company. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
including Purchaser, is an "investment company," a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," or an "investment adviser" within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act, or the Advisers Act.

Section 4.23 Interim Operations of Purchaser. Purchaser was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and has engaged in no business other than in connection with entering into
this Agreement and engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 4.24 Required Vote by Parent Stockholders. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of votes cast at a meeting at which a majority of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock are
present and voting (the "Required Parent Vote") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the capital stock of Parent



 

57 necessary to increase the authorized number of shares of Parent Common Stock
and to authorize the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350 (i)(1)(c) (the "Parent
Proposal").

Section 4.25 Recommendation of Parent Board of Directors; Opinion of Financial
Advisor.

(a) The Parent Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted
resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and the Parent Proposal are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
stockholders of Parent, (ii) approving this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and the Parent Proposal, (iii) resolving to recommend
approval and adoption of the Parent Proposal to the stockholders of Parent and
(iv) directing that the Parent Proposal be submitted to Parents stockholders
for consideration in accordance with this Agreement, which resolutions, as of
the date of this Agreement, have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way.

(b) Parent has received an opinion of Petrie Parkman and Co. ("Petrie Parkman")
to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration to be paid by Parent in the Merger is fair, from a financial
point of view, to Parent, a signed copy of which opinion has been, or will
promptly be, delivered to the Company. Parent has received the approval of
Petrie Parkman to permit the inclusion of a copy of its written opinion in
its entirety in the Proxy Statement, subject to Petrie Parkmans review of the
Proxy Statement.

Section 4.26 Brokers. Except for Harris Nesbitt Corp. ("Harris Nesbitt"), no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, that is or will be payable by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Parent is solely responsible for the fees and expenses of
Harris Nesbitt as and to the extent set forth in the engagement letter dated
February 16, 2006. Parent has previously delivered to the Company a true and
correct copy of such engagement letter.

Section 4.27 Tax Matters. Neither Parent, nor Purchaser, nor any of Parents
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the
Integrated Transaction from constituting a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

(a) The Acquisition Merger and the Upstream Merger will be carried out
strictly in accordance with this Agreement, and there are no other written or
oral agreements relating to the Acquisition Merger or Upstream Merger other
than those expressly referred to in this Agreement.

(b) The Acquisition Merger and the Upstream Merger are a part of an
integrated plan for Parent to acquire the assets of the Company. The parties
intend that the Acquisition Merger and the Upstream Merger will be treated,
for federal income tax purposes, as if parent had directly acquired the
Companys assets through a "statutory merger" as that term is used in Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code

(c) In connection with the Merger, no shares of Company Common Stock will be
acquired by Parent or a Related Person for consideration other than shares of
Parent Common Stock, except for the Per Share Cash Consideration, payments to
holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, and any cash paid in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.



 

58 (d) The fair market value of the Aggregate Merger Consideration will be
approximately equal to the fair market value of the shares of Company Common
Stock surrendered in the exchange, determined as of the last Business Day
before the date of this Agreement.

(e) Other than cash paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, neither Parent nor Purchaser (nor any Related Person) has any plan or
intention to redeem or otherwise reacquire, directly or indirectly, any
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

(f) Parent has no stock repurchase program and has no current plan or
intention to adopt such a plan.

(g) Taking into account that portion of the shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged for cash (including without limitation cash received in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash paid by Parent with
respect to Dissenting Shares), the aggregate fair market value, determined as
of the end of the last Business Day before the date of this Agreement, of the
Total Stock Consideration will not be less than forty percent (40%) of the
value, determined as of the end of the last Business Day before the date of
this Agreement, of the consideration paid to the holders of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.

(h) Neither Parent nor any Related Person owns, nor has it owned during the
past five years, any shares of stock of the Company. Neither Parent nor any
Related Person has caused any other Person to acquire stock of the Company on
behalf of Parent or a Related Person, and will not directly or indirectly
acquire any stock of the Company in connection with the Merger, except as
described in this Agreement.

(i) Parent has not, directly or indirectly, transferred any cash or property
to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the
Company) for less than full and adequate consideration and has not made any
loan to the Company (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by the
Company) in anticipation of the Merger.

(j) There is no intercompany indebtedness existing between Parent and
Company, or between Purchaser and Company, that was or will be issued,
acquired, or settled at a discount in connection with the Merger.

(k) Parent and Purchaser will each pay their respective expenses incurred in
connection with or as part of the Merger or related transactions. Neither
Parent nor Purchaser has paid and will not pay, directly or indirectly, any
expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with or as part of the Merger or any
related transactions (except with respect to Parents own expenses incurred in
connection with the Upstream Merger). Neither Parent nor Purchaser has agreed
to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other
liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock.



 

59 (l) Any compensation paid to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock who
enter (or have entered) into employment, consulting or noncompetitive
contracts, if any, with Parent or the Surviving Corporation (a) will be for
services actually rendered or to be rendered, (b) will be commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arms length for similar
services, and (c) will not represent consideration for the surrender of the
shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger.

(m) Purchaser is a Delaware corporation wholly and directly owned by Parent
and has been newly formed solely to consummate the Merger. Prior to the
Effective Time, Purchaser will have no assets other than cash to satisfy
capital requirements under state law, and has not, and will not, conduct any
business activities or other operations of any kind other than the issuance of
its stock to Parent or as otherwise expressly required by this Agreement.

 

At the Effective Time, Purchaser will not have or issue any warrants, options,
convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any
Person could acquire any stock in Purchaser.

(n) Following the Integrated Transaction, Parent will continue the historic
business of Company or use a significant portion of its assets in a business,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).

(o) Parent has no plan or intention to liquidate or merge the Company with or
into another corporation (other than with and into Parent pursuant to the
Upstream Merger); to sell or otherwise dispose of the stock of the Company or
any of its assets; or to cause or permit the Company to sell or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets or any of the assets acquired from Purchaser
except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business.

(p) Following the Merger, Parent has no plan or intention to cause the
Surviving Corporation to issue additional shares of Surviving Corporation
stock that would result in Parent owning stock possessing less than eighty
percent (80%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
entitled to vote or less than eighty percent (80%) of the total number of
shares of all other classes of stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(q) Parent is paying no consideration for the shares of the Company Common
Stock other than the Aggregate Merger Consideration.

(r) Any Company liabilities assumed or paid by Parent or Purchaser and the
liabilities to which the assets of the Company are subject were incurred by
the Company in the ordinary course of its business.

(s) Neither Parent nor Purchaser is an investment company within the meaning
of Sections 368(a)(2)(F) of the Code. An investment company is (1) a regulated
investment company; (2) a real estate investment trust; or (3) a corporation
(i) fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of whose total assets are stock
and securities, and (ii) eighty percent (80%) or more of the value of whose
total assets are held for investment. In making the fifty percent and eighty
percent determinations under the preceding sentence, stock and securities in
any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and a parent corporation shall
be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiarys assets, and a
corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if a parent



 

60 owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of all classes
of stock entitled to vote, or fifty percent (50%) or more of the total value
of shares of all classes of stock outstanding. For this purpose, "total
assets" shall not include cash and cash items (including receivables) and
government securities.

(t) Parent has substantial non-tax business purposes and reasons for the
Integrated Transaction, and the terms of the Merger are the product of arms
length negotiations.

(u) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will take any position on any
Return, or take any other Tax reporting position that is inconsistent with
the treatment of the Integrated Transaction as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by a
"determination" (as defined in Code Section 1313(a)(1)).

(v) No stock or securities of Parent will be issued to any Company stockholder
for services rendered to or for the benefit of Parent, Purchaser, or the
Company in connection with the Merger.

(w) No stock or securities of Parent will be issued for any indebtedness owed
to any Company stockholder in connection with the Merger.

(x) The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for
consideration. The total cash that will be paid in the Merger to the holders
of Common Company Stock instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of the total consideration that will be
paid in the Merger to the Company stockholders in exchange for their
Company Common Stock.

(y) No stock of Purchaser will be issued in connection with the Merger.

(z) Parent has not distributed the stock of any corporation in a transaction
satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the Code since April 16, 1997.
The stock of Parent has not been distributed in a transaction satisfying the
requirements of Section 355 of the Code since April 16, 1997.

(aa) After the Effective Time, and at all times prior to and as of the
effective time of the Upstream Merger (the "Second Effective Time"), Parent
will be a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware. After the Effective Time, and at all
times prior to the Second Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Delaware.

(bb) After the Effective Time, and at all times prior to the Second Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporations issued and outstanding capital stock will
consist solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, all of which will be owned
directly by Parent.

(cc) After the Effective Time, and at all times prior to the Second Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will not dispose of any assets held by the
Surviving Corporation.



 

61 (dd) After the Effective Time, and at all times prior to the Second Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will not incur any additional liabilities,
other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

(ee) After the Second Effective Time, Parent will not transfer any of the
former assets of the Surviving Corporation to a corporation or other entity as
part of a plan that includes either the Acquisition Merger or the Upstream
Merger.

(ff) After the Effective Time, and at all times prior to the Second Effective
Time, there will be no indebtedness existing between the
Surviving Corporation and Parent.

(gg) At one or more times during the five-year period leading up to and ending
as of the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent was a "United States real
property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code ("USRPHC"). For this purpose, Parent would be a USRPHC if the fair market
value of its interests in United States real property (including any interest
in a mine, well, or other natural deposit) shall have equaled or exceeded
fifty percent (50%) of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real
property interests plus any other assets used or held for use in its trade or
business.

(hh) Immediately after the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent expects that
it will continue to be treated as a USRPHC, taking into account the United
States real property owned by Company or Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.28 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article 4, neither Parent,
Purchaser nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty on behalf of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.3 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective officers,
directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
agents and other representatives not to (i) directly or indirectly initiate,
solicit,



 

69 knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public
information) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
disclose any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an Acquisition
Proposal or to any Person in contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, including
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement,
arrangement or understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted
pursuant to this Section 5.3) or (B) requiring, intended to cause, or which
could reasonably be expected to cause the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (each an "Acquisition Agreement"). Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or by any representatives of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such representative is
so authorized and whether or not such representative is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board may take any
actions described in clause (ii) or (iii) of this Section 5.3(a) with respect
to a third party if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote
(w) the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal from such third party
(and such Acquisition Proposal was not during such time period initiated,
solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other
representatives), and (x) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, provided that the Company shall not deliver any information
to such third party without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) the Company has previously disclosed or concurrently
discloses or makes available the same information, if any, to Parent as it
makes available to such third party and provides to Parent a copy of the
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement that the Company entered into with such
third party. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law. 

(b) Neither (i) the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") nor (ii) shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries execute or enter into an Acquisition
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at



 

70 any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the
Companys compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and
Section 5.6, in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and enter into an Acquisition Agreement
but only so long as the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and
after complying with all the provisions of, Section 7.1(d) and 8.1; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and enter into an Acquisition
Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal (x) until four Business Days
after the Company provides written notice to Parent (a "Company Notice")
advising Parent that the Company Board or a committee thereof has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or group making such Superior
Proposal and (y) if during such four Business Day period, Parent proposes
any alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement), unless the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking
into account all financial, legal, and regulatory terms and conditions of
such alternative transaction proposal) that such alternative transaction
proposal is not at least as favorable to the Company and its stockholders from
a financial point of view as the Superior Proposal (it being understood that
any change in the financial or other material terms of a Superior Proposal
shall require a new Company Notice and a new four Business Day period under
this Section 5.3(b)).

(c) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Company),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to
the Company), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Parent Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger,
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Parent Proposal.

(d) The parties agree that in addition to the obligations of the Company and
Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Section 5.3, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, the Company shall advise Parent
in writing of any Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, or any
request for information, inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, and the terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by
the Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the
Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or
with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company
agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning itself or its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person
or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not
previously provided to the Parent. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of
the parties and price involved and any changes to any material terms and
conditions thereof). The Company agrees not to release any third party from,
or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which it is a party.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any bona
fide proposal, whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that constitute 10% or more
of the net revenues, net income or the assets



 

71 (based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or
more of any class of equity securities or capital stock of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 10% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or
other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar
transaction that if consummated would result in any Person or Persons
beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 10% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant
to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or
other business combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 50% or more of the then
outstanding equity securities of the Company, in each case on terms which a
majority of the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement) proposed by any other party in response to such Superior Proposal,
including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any risks
of non-consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal) to be superior to such
party and its stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) from a
financial point of view as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to any alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms
of this Agreement) proposed by the Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3.

(f) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to
any possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall (i) take
the necessary steps to promptly inform its officers, directors, investments
bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other
representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3 and (ii) request each Person
who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
such Persons consideration of acquiring the Company or any material portion
thereof to return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing
by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf to the extent such
request is permitted or contemplated by such confidentiality agreement.

Section 5.4 Access to Information and Properties.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives of
the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties,



 

72 contracts, commitments, records, data and books and personnel and, during such
period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the
other parties all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as the other parties may reasonably request. No party nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Company and Parent will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party and
its authorized representatives, including engineers, advisors and consultants,
lenders and financing sources, upon reasonable notice and in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the business of the applicable party or
any of its Subsidiaries, may enter into and upon all or any portion of the
real property owned or leased by the other party in order to investigate
and assess, as such party reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, the
environmental condition of such real property and the other assets or the
businesses of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries (an
"Investigation"). An Investigation may include a Phase I environmental site
assessment, or similar investigation; provided, however, that an Investigation
shall not include any sampling or testing of soil and/or ground or surface
waters at, on or under any real property. Each party hereto shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the other parties in
conducting any such Investigation, facilitating further testing or evaluation
as may be reasonably prudent with respect to matters identified in
the investigation, allow any other party reasonable access to such partys
and its Subsidiaries respective businesses, real property and other assets,
together with full permission to conduct any such Investigation, and provide
to any other party all plans, soil or surface or ground water tests or
reports, any environmental investigation results, reports or assessments
previously or contemporaneously conducted or prepared by or on behalf of such
party, its Subsidiaries, or any of their predecessors that are in the
possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, and all information
relating to environmental matters regarding such partys and its Subsidiaries
respective businesses, real property and other assets that are in the
possession of such party or any of its Subsidiaries. Under the terms of
applicable operating agreements, access to Company Oil and Gas Properties and
Parent Oil and Gas Properties which are operated by third parties may require
such third-party operators prior approval and, where applicable, execution
of such third-party operators customary boarding agreement. The Company (with
respect to the Company Oil and Gas Properties) or Parent (with respect to the
Parent Oil and Gas Properties) shall, upon request of the other party (the
"Requesting Party"), request the third party operators approval for the
Requesting Party to access and inspect the affected oil and gas properties.
The Requesting Party shall repair any damage to the oil and gas properties
resulting from such inspections and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the other party, its co-owners, Subsidiaries and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all
claims, demands, losses, damages or causes of action arising from or relating
to the Requesting Partys inspection of the other Partys oil and gas
properties, including, without limitation, claims of property damage,
personal injury or death of any person arising from or relating to Requesting
Partys inspection, regardless of the negligence, strict liability or other
fault (but not gross negligence or willful misconduct) of the indemnified
party. 



 

73 (c) Parent and the Company will hold any information contemplated under
Sections 5.4(a) and/or (b) above and any notices, agreements or information
furnished pursuant to Section 5.3 in accordance with the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of February
13, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(d) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.5 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties hereto, to obtain all necessary authorizations, consents and
approvals, and to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and to
assist Parent and Purchaser in obtaining any financing it may arrange in
connection with the Merger. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the
other parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such
other parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
will provide the other parties with copies of all filings made by such party
with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party
to a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may
be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall,
as soon as practicable, file any required Notification and Report Forms under
the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all
inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional
information or documentation.

(c) Each party shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state
takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to take any action
to exempt any stockholder of the Company from any such Law.



 

74 (d) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Corporation shall take or
cause to be taken all such necessary action.

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, neither
Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to accept, as a condition to obtaining
any required approval or resolving any objection of any Governmental Entity,
any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of
any other condition or restriction with respect to) any of the respective
businesses of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, the Company Assets, the Parent Assets, the Company Real Property
or the Parent Real Property.

"Proxy Statement") and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and the

carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent and Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Purchaser that should be set
forth in an amendment to the S-4 or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Company, Parent or Purchaser shall promptly inform the other parties hereto
thereof in writing. All documents that the Company or Parent is responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The parties shall

Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the S-4 or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence
between it or any of its



 

75 Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or the Merger and
(ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the S-4.

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, a special meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement (such meeting, including
any postponement or adjournment thereof, the "Company Special Meeting"), and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Special Meeting as
soon as practical but no later than 45 days after such date. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.3(b), the Company, acting through the Company
Board, shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement and include in the Proxy
Statement such recommendation, and shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent such
recommendation, or take any action or make any statements in connection with
the Company Special Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation, and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption.

(d) Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall, in accordance with its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly and
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable following
the date upon which the S-4 becomes effective for the purposes of voting upon
the Parent Proposal a meeting of its stockholders (such meeting, including any

and shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent Stockholders
Meeting as soon as practical but no later than 45 days after such date.

76 Section 5.8 Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification.

(a) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall (i)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries in such capacities ("Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, in each case against any losses, damages,
expenses or liabilities resulting from any claim, liability, loss, damage,
cost or expense, asserted against, or incurred by, an Indemnified Party that
is based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
arising out of or pertaining to actions or omissions or alleged actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) take all
necessary actions to ensure that Parents directors and officers liability
insurance continues to cover each Company Director and each officer and
director of the Company, in each case so long as they remain employed or
retained by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including the
Surviving Corporation) as an officer or director. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an "Action"), (i) Parent
shall and shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay, as incurred, the fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent, in advance of the final disposition of any
such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and, if
required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law, and
(ii) Parent will, and will cause Surviving Corporation to, cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; provided, however, none of Parent or Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). With
respect to any determination of whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to
require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party and approved by Parent (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise
performed material services for Parent or the Indemnified Party within the
last three years.

(b) The rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to
advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, or in the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any indemnification agreement of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring through the
Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect.

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, directors and officers liability insurance under a
policy and with a company reasonably acceptable to the Company covering, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are or at any time prior to the Effective
Time were covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred before the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other
proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or
after the Effective Time), with coverage substantially similar to such
directors and officers liability insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any
other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the



 

77 Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or otherwise.
The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, are expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, and
may not be amended or terminated after the Effective Time in a manner contrary
to the interest of an Indemnified Party without the consent of such
Indemnified Party.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent
contained in this Section 5.8 shall be binding upon the successors and
assigns of Parent. In the event Parent or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent shall assume and honor the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.8.

Section 5.9 Publicity. Neither the Company, Parent, Purchaser nor any of their
respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
consultation of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with Nasdaq or the NYSE. In addition, each of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser agrees to consult with the other party before issuing any
press release or other announcement with respect to its business, except as
may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with the Nasdaq or the
NYSE if all reasonable best efforts have been made to consult with the other
party.

Section 5.10 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on Nasdaq subject to official notice of
issuance, as of the Effective Time.

Section 5.11 Employee Benefits.

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of
its affiliates to employ any employee of the Company for any length of
time following the Effective Time. Except as specifically provided in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed
to prevent Parent or its affiliates from (i) terminating, or modifying the
terms of employment of, any Company employee following the Closing Date or
(ii) terminating or modifying to any extent any Company Plan (including the
Companys Star Program) or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement that Parent or its affiliates may establish or maintain.

(b) The severance policy and practices of the Company as set forth in the
employee handbook of the Company as of the date of this Agreement and a copy
of which is attached to the Company Disclosure Letter as Annex A (the "Company
Severance Policy") as they apply to Eligible Employees shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be modified or amended for a period of 24
months after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause the Company Severance Policy to be modified to provide that (i)
any Eligible Employee who is terminated for any reason other than cause, or
who resigns for Good Reason shall be entitled to severance payments and other
benefits of the type and in the amount set forth in the Company Severance
Policy and (ii) Eligible Employees must resign within ten (10) Business



 

78 Days of receiving notice of an event constituting Good Reason in order to be
entitled to such severance payments and benefits. The Company Severance
Policy shall also be modified to provide that all severance payments due
thereunder shall be payable at the time of the Eligible Employees termination
of employment, whether by reason of termination of the Eligible Employee for
any reason other than cause or such persons resignation for Good Reason. For
purposes of this Section 5.11, "Good Reason" shall mean (i) any reduction in
an Eligible Employees annual base salary or expected total compensation
(including bonus and benefits) or (ii) requiring such Eligible Employee to be
based at any office location further than 25 miles from such Eligible
Employees office location as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to make any payments set
forth in the Company Severance Policy until each Eligible Employee of the
Company entitled to such payments executes and delivers a waiver and release
to Parent substantially in the form attached to the Company Disclosure Letter
as Annex B.

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to
each of the persons set forth in Section 5.11(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter the amount set forth in such Section 5.11(c) in respect of such
persons "protected vacation hours." After the Effective Time, all employees
of the Company shall be subject to, and entitled to the benefits of, Parents
vacation policies; provided, however, that each such employee shall be
entitled to no less annual vacation time than such employee was entitled to
immediately prior to the Effective Time and such employee will receive credit
for all unused vacation balances as of the Effective Time under the Parents
vacation policy. To the extent allowed by law and the terms of Parents
plans, for purposes of determining years of service, eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels with Parent or its affiliates with regard to employee benefits
offered by Parent or its affiliates, years of service in which a
Company employee has been employed by the Company or its predecessors shall
be counted. To the extent allowed by Law and the terms of Parents plans,
following the Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent plan in which any
continuing employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-
work requirement or waiting period to the extent such condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company plan as of the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan
transition date), (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles
or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time for the plan
year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date) occurs and (iii)
credit the existing 2006 personal time off hours granted by the Company to
the Parents sick leave plan. In order to implement the intent of Section
5.11(c), Parent shall take all reasonable actions to amend the Parents plans.

(d) Part I of Section 5.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth,
with respect to each officer of the Company that is a party to an employment
agreement, the cash severance payments, bonus and vacation pay, if any, that
would be due to such officer under each officers employment agreement upon a
Change in Control (as defined therein, and either alone or in conjunction with
any other event). Parent acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be a Change of Control under such employment agreements
and that Parent shall, at the Effective Time, be responsible for all of the
obligations of the Company thereunder. Notwithstanding the terms of
such employment agreements, at the Effective Time, with respect to each
senior officer who is terminated for any reason other than "Cause" or who
terminates his employment for "Good Reason" in each case as defined in and
pursuant to the terms of his



 

79 employment agreement, each of the employment agreements of the senior officers
will be terminated and any nonsolicitation provisions therein will also be
terminated and will not survive the Effective Time. The Purchaser and Parent
hereby acknowledge and agree that the employment of the Persons set forth
under Part II of Schedule 5.11(d) will terminate for Good Reason at the
Effective Time and that the Effective Time will be the "Termination Date" of
each such Person as defined in their respective employment agreements.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated
to make any payments set forth in Section 5.11(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter until each officer of the Company entitled to such payments or that is
a party to an employment agreement executes and delivers a waiver and release
to Parent substantially in the form attached to the Company Disclosure Letter
as Annex C.

(e) Section 5.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, with respect
to each employee of the Company who is a party to a Change in Control
Agreement, the cash severance payments, bonus and vacation pay, if any, that
would be due to such officer under each such employees Change in Control
Agreement upon a Change in Control (as defined therein, and either alone or in
conjunction with any other event). Parent acknowledges that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be a Change of Control under such
agreements and that Parent shall, at the Effective Time, be responsible for
all of the obligations of the Company thereunder. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to make any payments set
forth in Section 5.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter until each employee
of the Company entitled to such payments or that is a party to a Change in
Control Agreement executes and delivers a waiver and release to Parent
substantially in the form attached to the Company Disclosure Letter as Annex
D.

(f) Any plan or bonus right granted in accordance with Section 5.1(f)(iii)
related to the retention of officers or employees of the Company shall remain
in full force and effect past the Effective Time until all payments thereunder
have been paid or satisfied.

(g) Except to the extent already set forth in Section 5.11 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Section 5.11(g) sets forth all the change of control
payments and benefits due to all the officers, directors and employees of the
Company in connection with the Merger, the Upstream Merger and the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement (whether alone or in
conjunction with any other event), including (i) any payments which would be
due under the Company Severance Policy, (ii) the value of the Company Stock
Awards, the Performance Stock Awards and the Company Options which would
accelerate (or the restrictions with respect to which would be lifted) in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (whether
alone or in conjunction with any other event) pursuant to the terms of the
Company Plans and any agreements or award certificates thereunder, and (iii)
any bonus, retention, vacation, insurance premium payments or any other
payments or benefits which would become due in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event), including pursuant to the plans listed on Section
3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, or which would become due as a result
of this Section 5.11.

(h) After the Effective Time, the Company Plans shall not be amended or
modified in a manner that would result in the termination of, or have an
adverse effect on, options or awards previously granted thereunder or in a
manner that would result in any such option or award



 

80 becoming deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code (including, but
not limited to, any amendment or modification that would result in the
grandfather provisions provided in guidance issued under Section 409A of the
Code being inapplicable to such option or award), except in each case in
accordance with or pursuant to the terms of the Company Plans and any
agreements or award certificates thereunder.

Section 5.12 Appointment of Directors. Immediately following the Effective
Time Parent shall take all corporate action necessary or advisable to cause
the election or appointment of nine (9) individuals who meet the criteria
described in Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter as directors
of Parent in the classes described in such Section 5.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that Parent
will have the right to designate five (5) of such individuals and the Company
will have the right to designate four (4) of such individuals. If any person
designated by a party pursuant to this Section 5.12 refuses to serve as a
director or ceases to be eligible, willing or able to serve as a director
prior to the Effective Time, then the vacancy resulting therefrom shall be
filled by another person designated by the party that designated the original
designee provided such person meets the criteria described in Section 5.12 of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Immediately following the Effective Time,
Parent shall also cause the Board of Directors of Parent to appoint to each
committee thereof at least one of its members who is a Company designee and at
least one who is a Parent designee.

Section 5.13 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Integrated Transaction to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and before or after the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Company shall knowingly take any
action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any
action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could cause the
Integrated Transaction to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with the record keeping
and information reporting requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-3. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

(c) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions set forth in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d).

(d) Officers of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall execute and deliver to
Andrews Kurth, LLP, Tax counsel for the Company, and Thompson and Knight, LLP,
Tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the form agreed to by
the parties and such law firms at such time or times as may reasonably be
requested by such law firms, including prior to the time the S-4 is declared
effective by the SEC and the Effective Time, in connection with such Tax
counsels respective delivery of opinions pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) and
6.3(d). Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to
be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would
cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in
the certificates described in this Section 5.13(d).



 

81 (e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Integrated Transaction that are required or permitted to be filed on or before
the Effective Time. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall pay, without
deduction from any amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and
without reimbursement from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on
it by any Governmental Entity, which becomes payable in connection with the
Integrated Transaction.

Section 5.14 Agreements of Rule 145 Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent and Purchaser
a list identifying all persons who, at the time of the meeting of the
Companys stockholders, the Company believes may be deemed to be "affiliates"
of the Company, as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145
under the Securities Act (the "Company Rule 145 Affiliates"). The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified
as a Company Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to execute and deliver to
Parent, at or prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (a "Company Rule 145
Agreement"). As an inducement to such Company Rule 145 Agreements, Parent
shall enter into a written registration rights agreement with such Company
Rule 145 Affiliates in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_
(the "Registration Rights Agreement").

Section 5.15 Acquisition Right.

(a) In the event the Merger fails to close for any reason, Parent shall
promptly provide the Property Information to the Company, and the Company
shall be entitled to purchase from Parent, at the Companys option exercisable
by written notice to Parent within thirty days after receipt of the Property
Information, fifty percent (50%) of any Oil and Gas Properties (the value of
which exceeds $1,000,000, in which Parent does not hold any interest as of the
date of this Agreement) which Parent acquired or entered into a contract or
agreement to acquire during the period from the date of this Agreement until
the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not have an option to acquire any of the Oil and Gas Properties in the
Flower Prospect in Scott, Logan and Yell Counties in Arkansas. The Companys
failure to notify Parent of its election within such thirty (30) day period
shall be deemed an election not to exercise the option. If the Company timely
exercises such option, the purchase price for the Oil and Gas Properties to be
acquired by the Company pursuant to such option, shall be in an amount equal
to fifty percent (50%) of the amount paid by Parent for the Oil and Gas
Properties of Parent that are subject to such option based on the value
allocated to such Oil and Gas Properties in the purchase by Parent (including
all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such purchase,
and adjusted to reflect the economic effective date of the purchase by the
Company) in cash. Subject to receipt of required third party consents (other
than governmental consents customarily obtained post-acquisition) and waiver
or expiration of applicable preferential purchase rights, such purchase by
the Company from Parent shall close within ten (10) days after the Company
timely delivers its written notice of intent to purchase to



 

82 Parent. In the event any portion of the offered Oil and Gas Properties are
subject to third party consents which have not been obtained, or preferential
purchase rights which have not expired or been waived, prior to the scheduled
closing date, then the parties shall proceed to closing as to the unaffected
Oil and Gas Properties only, and closing on the Oil and Gas Properties that
are affected by such preferential purchase rights and/or consents shall be
delayed until such consents have been obtained and such preferential rights
have expired or been waived. In the event such consents have not been
obtained, or the preferential purchase rights have not expired or been
waived, within ninety (90) days after the initial closing, then the Company
may, upon written notice to Parent, terminate its agreement to purchase the
Oil and Gas Properties affected thereby. The Company shall pay 50% of the
costs incurred by Parent, and be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of the
revenues, associated with the operations of such Oil and Gas Properties from
the date of purchase by Parent of such Oil and Gas Properties until the
closing of the sale of 50% of such Oil and Gas Properties to the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.15. The sale of such Oil and Gas Properties by
Parent to the Company shall be without representations, warranties
or recourse against Parent, provided, however, that the Company shall be
subrogated to all warranties and indemnities made by Parents predecessors in
title relating to such Oil and Gas Properties, except to the extent such
warranties and indemnities are not transferable.

(b) In the event the Merger fails to close for any reason, Parent shall be
entitled to purchase from the Company, at Parents option exercisable by
written notice to the Company within thirty days after receipt of the Property
Information, fifty percent (50%) of any Oil and Gas Properties (the value of
which exceeds $1,000,000, in which the Company does not hold any interest as
of the date of this Agreement) which the Company acquired or entered into a
contract or agreement to acquire during the period from the date of this
Agreement until the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not have an option to acquire any of the Oil and Gas
Properties in the Terryville Field. Parents failure to notify the Company of
its election within such thirty (30) day period shall be deemed an election
not to exercise the option. If Parent timely exercises such option, the
purchase price for the Oil and Gas Properties to be acquired by Parent
pursuant to such option shall be in amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
amount paid by the Company for the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company that
are subject to such option based on the value allocated to such Oil and Gas
Properties in the purchase by the Company (including all reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with such purchase, and adjusted to reflect the
economic effective date of the purchase by Parent) in cash. Subject to receipt
of required third party consents (other than governmental consents customarily
obtained post-acquisition) and waiver or expiration of applicable
preferential purchase rights, such purchase by Parent from the Company shall
close within ten (10) days after Parent timely delivers its written notice of
intent to purchase to the Company. In the event any portion of the offered
Oil and Gas Properties are subject to third party consents which have not been
obtained, or preferential purchase rights which have not expired or been
waived, prior to the scheduled closing date, then the parties shall proceed
to closing as to the unaffected Oil and Gas Properties only, and closing on
the Oil and Gas Properties that are affected by such preferential purchase
rights and/or consents shall be delayed until such consents have been obtained
and such preferential rights have expired or been waived. In the event such
consents have not been obtained, or the preferential purchase rights have not
expired or been waived, within ninety (90) days after the initial closing,
then the Company may, upon written notice to Parent, terminate its agreement
to purchase the Oil and Gas Properties affected thereby. Parent shall pay 50%
of the costs incurred by the Company, and be entitled to fifty percent (50%)
of the revenues, associated



 

83 with the operations of such Oil and Gas Properties from the date of purchase
by the Company of such Oil and Gas Properties until the closing of the sale
of 50% of such Oil and Gas Properties to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.15.
The sale of such Oil and Gas Properties by the Company to Parent shall be
without representations, warranties or recourse against the Company,
provided, however, that Parent shall be subrogated to all warranties and
indemnities made by the Companys predecessors in title relating to such Oil
and Gas Properties, except to the extent such warranties and indemnities are
not transferable.

likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The Company

Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) the Company and Parent will each be a
"party to the reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no default or event of
default will have occurred under the Parent Indenture, and the Company shall
have received a certificate of Parent signed on its behalf by its Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer to such effect. In addition, on a
pro forma basis and after giving effect to all transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, no default or event of default will have occurred under the
Company Indenture (excluding any defaults or events of default in existence
under the Company Indenture immediately prior to the Effective Time);
provided that, to the extent any notes remain outstanding under the Company
Indenture, the Company shall have complied with all the applicable provisions
of the Companys Indenture prior to the Effective Time, such that the

Effect" set forth therein) both at and as of the date of this Agreement and at

except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) individually or in the aggregate

Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Parent shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of the Company by each of two senior executive
officers of the Company to the foregoing effect;

(b) By either the Company or Parent upon written notice to the other, if: 

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2006
(the "Termination Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a party whose

material breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before such date;

(ii) any Governmental Entity shall have issued a statute, rule, order, decree

6.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by the Company)
or Section 6.2(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by
Parent or Purchaser);



 

88 (v) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of any of the other

published, sent or given (within the meaning of Rule 14e-2)), a statement
disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such Acquisition
Proposal, or (v) the Company or the Company Board shall have resolved to do
any of the foregoing.

a Superior Proposal, at all times in compliance in all material respects with

null and void after the expiration of any applicable period following such
notice. In the event of such termination, there shall be no liability on the
part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company, except as set forth in Section 8.1

ARTICLE 8

_MISCELLANEOUS_

Section 8.1 Fees and Expenses.

their respective affiliates) or any Person has publicly announced its
intention (whether or not conditional) to make such Acquisition Proposal, or

(d) For purposes of clause (iii) of Section 8.1(c) only, the term

(a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after approval by the stockholders of the Company of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger, but after any such approval
no amendment shall be made without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company if such amendment alters or changes (i) the Merger Consideration, or
(ii) any terms or conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change
would adversely affect the holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties to this Agreement
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other

any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by the other
party or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall
constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such
writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such
waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of
the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other
breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein
provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights
or remedies that any party may otherwise have at Law or in equity.

Section 8.5 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles or Sections, such
reference shall be to an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The word "affiliates" when used in this Agreement shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to them in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act. The phrase "beneficial ownership" and words of similar import
when used in this



 

92 Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act. The phrase "the date of this Agreement," "date hereof" and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be
deemed to refer to April 20, 2006.

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, that such
information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter or that such items are material to the Company,
Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections of each of the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in sections corresponding
to those contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the
disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a particular representation or
warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to
all other representations or warranties, notwithstanding the presence or
absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or
warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto (but only to the extent
an exception to a particular representation or warranty in one section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, is
disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to such other representation
or warranty reasonably apparent). 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Letter or in
the Company Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgement of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties
to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

Section 8.6 Headings; Schedules. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Disclosure of any matter pursuant to any
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not
be deemed to be an admission or representation as to the materiality of the
item so disclosed.

Section 8.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement.

Section 8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings (written and oral), among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 8.9 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void,



 

93 unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 8.10 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed,
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of
the parties hereto hereby agrees that any claim, suit, action or other
proceeding, directly or indirectly, arising out of, under or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware (and each agrees that no such claim, action, suit or other
proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its
affiliates except in such court), and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in
any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding and irrevocably and
unconditionally waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding. Each of the parties
hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered
mail to such Persons respective address set forth in Section 8.4 shall be
effective service of process for any claim, action, suit or other proceeding
in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. The
parties hereto hereby agree that a final, non-appealable judgment in any such
claim, suit, action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.

Section 8.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; provided that each of Parent and Purchaser may
assign this Agreement to any of its Subsidiaries, or to any lender to each of
Parent and Purchaser or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof as security for
obligations to such lender, and provided, further, that no assignment to any
such lender shall in any way affect Parents or Purchasers obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement.

Section 8.12 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party to this Agreement and their
permitted assignees, and (other than Sections 5.8, 5.11 and 8.11) nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no direct or
indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of any party to this
Agreement (whether such holder is a limited or general partner,
member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any affiliate of any party to this
Agreement, nor any director, officer, employee, representative, agent or other
controlling Person of each of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation arising under
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.13 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed by Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and that Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy at
Law or equity.
