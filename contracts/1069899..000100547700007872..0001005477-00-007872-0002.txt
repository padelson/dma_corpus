consideration of the sale and transfer of the Conveyed Assets (other than the
Conveyed Assets relating to Virginiamycin), Purchaser shall (i) pay to
Pfizer, as agent for the Asset Selling Corporations (or to
Pfizer\'s Affiliates as Pfizer may on behalf of the Asset Selling
Corporations direct in the written transfer instructions hereinafter referred
to), an aggregate amount of ninety million dollars ($90,000,000) (the
"Closing Date Payment") at the Closing and (ii) make the payments after the
Closing required by Section 2.8. The Closing Date Payment shall consist of
fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), in immediately available funds (the
"Cash Consideration") and forty million dollars ($40,000,000) pursuant to the
execution by Purchaser and delivery to Pfizer of the Purchaser\'s Note. The
Cash Consideration shall be paid by wire transfer in accordance with written
instructions given by Pfizer to Purchaser not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.   (b) In consideration of the sale and transfer
of the Conveyed Assets relating to Virginiamycin, Purchaser shall pay to
Pfizer, as agent for the Asset Selling Corporations (or to Pfizer\'s
Affiliates as Pfizer may on behalf of the Asset Selling Corporations direct
in the written transfer instructions hereinafter referred to), on each
Payment Date an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Net
Virginiamycin Revenues for the most recently completed Measurement Period
(each such payment, a "Net Revenues Payment"), in immediately available
funds, by wire transfer in accordance with written instructions given by
Pfizer to Purchaser not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the respective Payment Date; provided, however, that (i) the maximum
aggregate Net Revenues Payments for any Annual Period payable to Pfizer
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall be twelve million dollars
($12,000,000), provided that any amounts in excess of twelve million dollars
($12,000,000) otherwise payable to Pfizer pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) (if
not for this clause (i)) shall be due and payable on each subsequent Payment
Date until paid in full (subject to the same twelve million dollars
($12,000,000) maximum payment limitation for the applicable Annual Period,
except that such twelve million dollars ($12,000,000) maximum payment
limitation shall not apply to the last Annual Period) and (ii) Purchaser
shall not be required to make any further payments to Pfizer pursuant to this
Section 2.6(b) to the extent that Net Revenues Payments previously paid to
Pfizer equal fifty-five million dollars ($55,000,000) in the aggregate.
Any Net Revenues Payment made in excess of five (5) days after the
applicable Payment Date shall include interest thereon from such Payment Date
to the date such payment is made. In respect of the first thirty (30) days
after such Payment Date, interest shall accrue at an annual rate equal to
twelve percent (12%), and thereafter at two (2) times the prime rate as
quoted by Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. (or any successor thereto) until the
date of payment and, if payment is received after 1:00 p.m. New York City
time, including the date of payment. The obligation of Purchaser to make the
payments provided for in this Section 2.6(b) shall be subject to the credit
and offset provisions of Sections 2.7(d) and (f). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser, at its option, in respect of each of the first three
(3) Annual Periods, may defer the payment of    18   all or a part of
the Net Revenues Payment due and owing for any two (2) Measurement Periods in
the Annual Period, provided, that the maximum aggregate amount that may be
deferred in any one (1) Annual Period is three million dollars ($3,000,000).
Any such deferred payments will bear interest at an annual rate equal to
thirteen percent (13%) from the date such deferred payment was otherwise due
and owing until the date of payment and, if payment is received after 1:00
p.m. New York City time, including the date at payment (it being agreed that
such interest will only be due and owing on the original deferred amount and
will not compound). All such deferred amounts will be subject to payment in
whole or in part at any time at Purchaser\'s option without penalty and all
unpaid deferred amounts, together with accrued and unpaid interest, will be
finally due and owing on June 30, 2006. If Purchaser elects to defer
the payment of Net Revenues Payment otherwise due and owing to Pfizer,
then Purchaser will not redeem, purchase or make any other payment,
including dividend payments, in respect of any equity instrument issued by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Palladium Preferred Stock),
unless and until all deferred Net Revenues Payments, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, have been paid in full to Pfizer. The foregoing sentence
shall not prohibit the payment by Purchaser of a management fee to Palladium
in an amount previously disclosed to Pfizer. The provisions of this Section
2.6(b) shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7.3(d) hereof.   (c)
Concurrent with each Net Revenues Payment, Purchaser shall deliver to Pfizer
a schedule of the calculations supporting Purchaser\'s determination of the
Net Revenues Payment for the applicable Measurement Period (each such
schedule, a "Net Revenues Schedule"), provided that if no Net Revenues
Payment shall be due, on the thirtieth day following the last day of the
relevant Measurement Period, Purchaser shall deliver to Pfizer a Net Revenues
Schedule supporting such determination. The Net Revenues Schedule shall be
expressed in U.S. dollars and for purposes thereof other currencies shall
be translated into U.S. dollars as set forth in Section 10.12. Pfizer shall
have the right, not more than once in any calendar year (unless Pfizer
discovers a material error in Purchaser\'s preparation of any Net Revenues
Schedule, in which event Pfizer shall have a right of inspection on a
quarterly basis until it has received two (2) Net Revenues Schedules free of
material error) and no more than twelve (12) months after the date of the
relevant Net Revenues Schedule, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable
times, to cause its employees, agents and representatives to review and
examine Purchaser\'s books and records as they relate to the Net
Virginiamycin Revenues to verify each Net Revenues Schedule. Following
completion of each such review, if Pfizer\'s calculations differ from those
reflected in the applicable Net Revenues Schedule, Pfizer shall submit such
differences (a "Net Revenues Notice") to Purchaser and Pfizer and
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such differences
promptly. If Pfizer and Purchaser have not reached a resolution within ten
(10) Business Days after Pfizer delivers to Purchaser the Net Revenues
Notice, the differences shall be submitted to the Accounting Expert for
resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.7(c).
Upon written request by Pfizer, Purchaser will provide to Pfizer monthly
sales and related data with respect to the Virginiamycin Products during the
period following    19    * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT  the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date or the earlier payment in full of the maximum aggregate Net
Revenue Payments.   (d) Purchaser agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to promote the sale of Virginiamycin until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date or, if earlier, the date of the payment by Purchaser to
Pfizer of Net Revenue Payments aggregating fifty-five million dollars
($55,000,000), including, without limitation, devoting sufficient personnel
and resources to the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of
Virginiamycin to support such sales efforts, and not to take any actions
during such period that would have the effect of materially diminishing Net
Virginiamycin Revenues for any Measurement Period; provided that Purchaser
shall not be deemed to have violated its obligations pursuant to this Section
2.6(d) if (i) Purchaser curtails or abandons its Virginiamycin sales efforts
in an affected territory as the result of any restrictions or bans imposed by
Governmental Authorities after the Closing Date on the manufacture, storage,
distribution and sale of Virginiamycin in such territory; provided, however,
that Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any
such restriction or ban prior to it being imposed and to have it lifted or
vacated once imposed, (ii) notwithstanding Purchaser\'s commercially
reasonable efforts to promote the sale of Virginiamycin, the quantity of
Virginiamycin produced by or on behalf of Purchaser at the Rixensart plant or
elsewhere falls below [ * ] KGA on a rolling twelve (12)-month basis during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending five (5) years
thereafter, or (iii) (x) there is a decline in Net Virginiamycin Revenues for
any four (4) consecutive Measurement Periods of at least [ * ] as compared to
the Net Virginiamycin Revenues for the four (4) consecutive Measurement
Periods prior to such first four (4) periods and (y) during or prior to such
affected four (4) consecutive Measurement Periods, swine and poultry
producers/processors representing individually or in the aggregate at least [
* ] of the combined poultry and swine industry in the United States (based on
sales) publicly announced their intention to adopt a policy to cease selling
poultry and/or swine that have been raised on antibiotic feed
additive products.   (e) In the event that Purchaser sells, assigns or
transfers all or substantially all of the Conveyed Assets relating to
Virginiamycin (or takes any action that has the effect of transferring
ownership to such assets) prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date
or, if earlier, the date of the payment by Purchaser to Pfizer of Net Revenue
Payments aggregating fifty-five million dollars ($55,000,000), to any Person
(other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser), Purchaser shall be
required to pay to Pfizer on the day of such sale, assignment or transfer an
amount equal to (i) fifty-five million dollars ($55,000,000) less (ii) the
aggregate Net Revenue Payments previously made by Purchaser to Pfizer, in
immediately available funds, by wire transfer in accordance with written
instructions given by Pfizer to Purchaser not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the due date for such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pfizer
may, in its sole discretion, waive Purchaser\'s obligation to make the
foregoing payment upon any such sale, assignment or transfer in exchange for
the succeeding party\'s agreement to assume Purchaser\'s obligations under
this Section 2.6.    20    Section 2.7 Purchase Price Adjustment.  
(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall deliver to
Purchaser a statement of the Inventories of the Asset Selling Corporations as
of the Closing Date, without giving effect to any possible delayed transfers
of Conveyed Assets held by Asset Selling Corporations operating in Belgium,
Japan and/or China (the "Inventories Statement"). The Inventories Statement
shall be unaudited and shall state the Inventories of the Asset Selling
Corporations as of the Closing Date by following and applying the procedures
and valuation and other principles set forth on Schedule 2.7A hereto and, to
the extent not addressed in Schedule 2.7A, the Inventories Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Purchaser shall provide Pfizer with access
to the Inventories, books, records, and personnel of Purchaser necessary for
Pfizer to prepare the Inventories Statement.   (b) Purchaser may dispute the
amounts reflected on the Inventories Statement (a "Disputed Item"), but only
on the basis a Disputed Item does not reflect, or is not consistent or in
compliance with, the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that
Purchaser shall notify Pfizer in writing of each Disputed Item, and specify
the amount thereof in dispute and the basis therefor, within sixty (60) days
after receipt of the Inventories Statement. The failure by Purchaser to
provide a notice of Disputed Items to Pfizer within such sixty (60) day
period will constitute Purchaser\'s acceptance of the
Inventories Statement.   (c) If a notice of Disputed Items shall be timely
delivered pursuant to subclause (b) above, Pfizer and Purchaser shall, during
the ten (10) Business Days following the date of such delivery (the
"Resolution Period"), negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items.
If, during such Resolution Period the parties are unable to reach agreement,
Pfizer and Purchaser shall refer all unresolved Disputed Items to an
accounting firm or expert of nationally recognized standing as Pfizer and
Purchaser shall mutually agree upon or, if the parties are unable to so
agree, as appointed by the American Arbitration Association (the "Accounting
Expert"). The Accounting Expert shall make a determination with respect to
each unresolved Disputed Item within fifteen (15) days after its engagement
by Pfizer and Purchaser to resolve such Disputed Items, which determination
shall be made in accordance with the rules set forth in this Section 2.7. The
Accounting Expert shall deliver to Pfizer and Purchaser, within such fifteen
(15) day period, a report setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the
Inventories Statement and the calculations supporting such adjustments. Such
report shall be final and binding on the parties and conclusive. Pfizer and
Purchaser shall each pay one-half of all the costs incurred in connection
with the engagement of the Accounting Expert. As used herein, "Final
Inventories" shall mean (i) if no notice of Disputed Items is delivered by
Purchaser within the period provided in subclause (b) above, Inventories as
shown in the Inventories Statement as prepared by Pfizer, or (ii) if such a
notice of Disputed Items is delivered by Purchaser, either (x) as agreed to
in writing by Pfizer and Purchaser, or (y)    21    * OMITTED PURSUANT
TO OUR REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT  Inventories as shown in the
Accounting Expert\'s calculation delivered pursuant to this subclause
(c).   (d) If the Final Inventories is less than sixty-three million
five hundred thousand dollars ($63,500,000) but equal to or greater than
fifty-three million five hundred thousand dollars ($53,500,000), then the
aggregate principal amount of the Purchaser\'s Note will be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference between sixty-three million five
hundred thousand dollars ($63,500,000) and the Final Inventories. If the
Final Inventories is less than fifty-three million five hundred thousand
dollars ($53,500,000), then Purchaser also (in addition to the adjustment
described in the preceding sentence) will receive a credit and may offset
against the Net Revenues Payments in respect of the first Annual Period
(without giving effect to the deferral option provided for therein) an amount
equal to the difference between fifty-three million five hundred thousand
dollars ($53,500,000) and the Final Inventories. Further, if (x) the
difference between fifty-three million five hundred thousand dollars
($53,500,000) and the Final Inventories is greater than (y) the Net Revenues
Payments Purchaser is required to make to Pfizer pursuant to Section 2.6(b)
in respect of the first Annual Period (without giving effect to the deferral
option provided for therein but giving effect to any credit due and owing to
Purchaser provided for in Section 2.7(f)(ii)), then, within ten (10) days
after the last Payment Date in the first Annual Period, Pfizer shall pay to
Purchaser the difference between (x) and (y) in immediately available funds
by wire transfer in accordance with written instructions given by Purchaser
to Pfizer not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such date.   (e) If
the Final Inventories is greater than sixty-three million five hundred
thousand dollars ($63,500,000), there shall be no Purchase Price adjustment;
provided, that in such circumstance, notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 2.1(d) hereof, Pfizer may retain and not sell to Purchaser at
Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement Inventories in such
excess amount related to the Products identified on Schedule 2.7B hereto.
Such retained Inventories shall be selected by Pfizer in its sole discretion
and held by Pfizer for subsequent sale to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of
the Pfizer Supply and Tolling Agreement or such other purpose not in
contravention of the terms of this Agreement. Purchaser shall cooperate with
any reasonable requests for assistance made by Pfizer for purposes of
implementing the provisions of this Section 2.7(e).   (f) (i) [ * ] [ *

Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing, Pfizer shall deliver to
Purchaser its calculation of the vacation accrual on its books and records in
respect of Employees (US) who are hired by Purchaser.
Simultaneously therewith, Pfizer shall pay such amount to Purchaser by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with written
instructions given by Purchaser to Pfizer not less than two (2) Business Days
prior thereto.   (h) Any disputes between the parties regarding the matters
set forth in Sections 2.7(f) or 2.7(g) that are not resolved by the parties
shall be certified to the Accounting Expert for resolution in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.7(c) hereof, whose final determination
shall be binding on the parties.   Section 2.8 Production Margin Royalty
Payments.   (a) As further consideration of the sale and transfer of
the Conveyed Assets (other than the Conveyed Assets relating to
Virginiamycin), Purchaser shall pay to Pfizer, as agent for the Asset Selling
Corporations (or to Pfizer\'s Affiliates as Pfizer may on behalf of the Asset
Selling Corporations direct in the written transfer instructions hereinafter
referred to) forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of each Annual Period
(i.e., a five (5)-year payment period, subject to the proviso set forth in
this sentence below), or if such day is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day (such day, a "Royalty Payment Date") an amount equal
to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount by which the Gross Profit
Excluding Virginiamycin exceeds fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) for the
most recently completed Annual Period (each such payment, a "Royalty
Payment"), in immediately available funds, by wire transfer in accordance
with written instructions given by Pfizer to Purchaser not less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the respective payment date; provided, however, that
the maximum aggregate Royalty Payments that Purchaser is required to make to
Pfizer pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be ten million
dollars ($10,000,000). Any Royalty Payment made in excess of five (5) days
after the applicable Royalty Payment Date shall include interest thereon from
such Royalty Payment Date to the date such payment is made. In respect of the
first thirty (30) days after such Royalty Payment Date, interest shall accrue
at an annual rate equal to twelve percent (12%), and thereafter at two (2)
times the prime rate as quoted by    23   Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.
(or any successor thereto) until the date of payment and, if payment is
received after 1:00 p.m. New York City time, including the date of
payment.   (b) Concurrent with each Royalty Payment, Purchaser shall deliver
to Pfizer a schedule of the calculations supporting Purchaser\'s
determination of the Royalty Payment for the applicable Annual Period (each
such schedule, a "Royalty Payment Schedule"), provided that if no Royalty
Payment shall be due in respect of such Annual Period, on the thirtieth day
after the last day of the Annual Period, Purchaser shall deliver to Pfizer a
Royalty Payment Schedule supporting such determination. The Royalty Payment
Schedule shall be expressed in U.S. dollars and for purposes thereof other
currencies shall be translated into U.S. dollars as set forth in Section
10.12. Pfizer shall have the right, not more than twelve (12) months after
the date of the relevant Royalty Payment Schedule, upon reasonable notice and
at reasonable times, to cause its employees, agents and representatives to
review and examine Purchaser\'s books and records as they relate to the Gross
Profit Excluding Virginiamycin to verify each Royalty Payment Schedule.
Following completion of each such review, if Pfizer\'s calculations differ
from those reflected in the applicable Royalty Payment Schedule, Pfizer shall
submit such differences (a "Royalty Payment Notice") to Purchaser and Pfizer
and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such differences
promptly. If Pfizer and Purchaser have not reached a resolution within ten
(10) Business Days after Pfizer delivers to Purchaser the Royalty Payment
Notice, the differences shall be submitted to the Accounting Expert for
resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.7(c).
Upon written request by Pfizer, Purchaser will provide to Pfizer
monthly sales and related data with respect to the Products (excluding the
Virginiamycin Products) during the period following the Closing Date until
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date or the earlier payment in full of
the maximum aggregate Royalty Payments.   (c) Purchaser agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promote the sale of the Products
(excluding the Virginiamycin Products) and any extensions, improvements,
substitutes or replacements therefor, in each case that contain the same
active ingredients as the Products, until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date or, if earlier, the date of the payment by Purchaser to Pfizer
of Royalty Payments aggregating ten million dollars ($10,000,000). The
foregoing agreement includes, without limitation, devoting sufficient
personnel and resources to the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of
such Products to support such sales efforts, and not to take any
actions during such period that would have the effect of materially
diminishing Gross Profit Excluding Virginiamycin for any Annual Period.  
(d) Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date or, if earlier, the date
of the payment by Purchaser to Pfizer of Royalty Payments aggregating ten
million dollars ($10,000,000), should the Purchaser sell, assign or
transfer to any third party its right to manufacture, store, distribute and
sell any of the Products, the gross margin annually derived from such
Products, based on the annual average historical sales during the twenty-four
(24) months preceding the date of sale, assignment or transfer, will continue
to be included in the "Gross Profit Excluding Virginiamycin" calculation
notwithstanding their prior sale, assignment or transfer.    24   
Section 2.9 Allocation of the Purchase Price. Pfizer, on behalf of itself and
the other Asset Selling Corporations, and Purchaser have agreed to the
allocation of the Purchase Price among the Asset Selling Corporations as
set forth in Schedule 2.9 hereto (the "Allocation"). Purchaser will prepare
and Pfizer will agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, to
a suballocation among the Conveyed Assets, separately for each Asset
Selling Corporation, in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of
the Code. Each of Pfizer and the other Asset Selling Corporations on the one
hand and Purchaser on the other shall (i) be bound by the Allocation for
purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file, and cause its
Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
the Allocation, and (iii) take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take
no position, inconsistent with the Allocation on any applicable Tax Return or
in any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise. The Asset
Selling Corporations and Purchaser shall cooperate in the filing of any forms
(including Form 8594) with respect to such Allocation, including any
amendments to such forms required with respect to any Purchase Price
adjustment pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that the Allocation is
disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute
shall promptly notify the other party hereto concerning resolution of the
dispute. Each of the Asset Selling Corporations and Purchaser acknowledge
that the Allocation was done at arm\'s length based upon a good faith
estimate of fair market values.   ARTICLE III   CLOSING   Section 3.1

organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of the Asset Selling
Corporations is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign   
27   corporation to do business, and, where applicable, is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 5.2 Authority; Binding Effect.   (a) Pfizer and the
other Asset Selling Corporations each has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own the Conveyed Assets and manufacture and sell the Products
and to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder. The execution and delivery by Pfizer and the other Asset Selling
Corporations of this Agreement, and the performance by Pfizer and the other
Asset Selling Corporations of their respective obligations hereunder, have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings are required in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement.   (b) This Agreement and each of the
agreements and other documents to be executed by Pfizer and/or one or more of
the other Asset Selling Corporations and delivered to Purchaser and/or its
designee pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (the "Sellers\'
Documents") constitutes and will constitute a valid and binding obligation of
Pfizer and/or each of the other Asset Selling Corporations, as the case may
be, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors\' rights generally or by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
a proceeding in equity or law).   Section 5.3 Non-Contravention. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Sellers\'
Documents by Pfizer and/or the other Asset Selling Corporations and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of Pfizer or any other
Asset Selling Corporation, (ii) subject to obtaining the consents referred to
in Schedule 5.3, conflict with, or result in the breach of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the termination, cancellation or acceleration
(whether after the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both) of any
obligation of Pfizer or any other Asset Selling Corporation under, or to a
loss of any benefit to which Pfizer or any other Asset Selling Corporation is
entitled under, any Assumed Contract or Intellectual Property License to
which any Asset Selling Corporation is a party or to which its assets are
subject, (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien, other than a
Permitted Encumbrance, on any Conveyed Asset, (iv) subject to obtaining
the consents and approvals referred to in Sections 5.4 and 6.5, violate or
result in a breach of or constitute a default under any Law or other
restriction of any Governmental Authority to which any Asset Selling
Corporation is subject, except, with respect to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv),
for any violations, conflicts, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or Liens which    28   are not reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 5.4 Pfizer Consents and Approvals. Other than as set forth in
Schedule 5.4, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Sellers\' Documents by Pfizer and/or the other Asset Selling Corporations and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein by
Pfizer and the other Asset Selling Corporations do not or will not require
any consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, except consents or
approvals, the failure of which to obtain would not be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.5 Financial Information. Except
as set forth in Schedule 5.5, the Financial Information has been prepared in
accordance with Pfizer\'s policies and procedures, and in accordance with
Pfizer\'s books and records and is in accordance with GAAP, and present

respects, the book value of the inventory, property, plant and equipment and

specified and (ii) the selected income data for the periods therein
specified. The Inventories reflected in the Financial Information are valued
at the lower of cost or market value with allowance for obsolescence, in

Financial Information. Purchaser acknowledges that such adjustments (i)
are based solely on Pfizer\'s judgment and estimates and have not been
reviewed by Pfizer\'s auditors, (ii) may not result in any benefit to
Purchaser following Purchaser\'s acquisition of the Conveyed Assets due to
changes in cost structures, operations, and other relevant matters, and (iii)
are not meant in any way to be a guarantee of benefits to be received by

flows to be achieved by the Business from and after the Closing Date.

Selling Corporations have any license or right to use any Intellectual
Property in connection with the Business are in full force and effect and
Pfizer or the other Asset Selling Corporations party thereto have not
defaulted on any of its obligations under such agreements that would give the
non-defaulting party a right to terminate such agreement or a right to
receive any payment pursuant to such agreement. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.12, all Intellectual Property used in the Business and
registrations, applications, and agreements related thereto are fully
assignable to Purchaser without the consent of any third party.   Section

reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary for it to do under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, to (i) comply promptly with all
legal requirements which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (which actions shall include,
without limitation, furnishing all information required by applicable Law in
connection with approvals of or filings with any Governmental Authority),
(ii) satisfy the conditions precedent to the obligations of the other party
hereto, (iii) obtain any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any

assigned to Purchaser, to convey or assign those Environmental Permits to the
Purchaser at the Closing (to the extent that the terms of certain
Environmental Permits or the Environmental Laws pursuant to which those

Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as
practicable), and (v) take any action reasonably necessary to defend, lift,

such party to a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) Without limiting the generality
of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 7.3, Purchaser and Pfizer agree
to provide promptly to Governmental Authorities with regulatory jurisdiction
over enforcement of any applicable Competition Laws ("Governmental Antitrust
Entity") information and documents requested by any Government Antitrust
Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
acquisition of the Conveyed Assets and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Pfizer and Purchaser will provide to the other copies of
all correspondence between it (or its advisor) and any Government Antitrust
Entity relating to the acquisition of the Conveyed Assets or any of the
matters described in this Section 7.3. Pfizer and Purchaser agree that all
telephone calls and meetings with a Government Antitrust Entity regarding the
acquisition of the Conveyed Assets or any of the matters described in this
Section 7.3 shall, to the extent practicable, include representatives
of Pfizer and Purchaser. Pfizer and Purchaser acknowledge that each has made
the requisite filings pursuant to the HSR Act and all applicable waiting
periods thereunder have expired or terminated.   (d) (i) The parties
acknowledge that Purchaser cannot acquire the Belgian Facility until it has
obtained the necessary operating permits from the applicable Belgian
Governmental Authorities set forth in Schedule 7.3(d). If Purchaser obtains
all such permits listed on Schedule 7.3(d) on or prior to the Closing Date,
then the Belgian Facility will be transferred to Purchaser as part of the
Closing. If this does not occur on or prior to the Closing Date, then
the Closing will occur as scheduled on the Closing Date with respect to all
Conveyed Assets and Assumed Liabilities (except for the Belgian Facility and
the Equipment located at the Belgium Facility (the "Belgian Facility and
Related Assets")), and Purchaser will make payment of the Closing Date
Payment on the Closing Date and the Net Revenues Payments (subject to the
terms of this subsection (d)(i)) and Royalty Payments on the dates such
payments are due. In addition, from the Closing Date to the time the
Purchaser obtains the necessary operating permits and the Belgian Facility
and Related Assets are transferred to Purchaser (such period, the "Belgium
Interim"), Virginiamycin will be supplied by Pfizer to Purchaser pursuant to
a supply agreement to be mutually agreed to by the parties reflecting the
terms set forth on the term sheet appearing as Schedule 7.3(d)(2) (the
"Belgian Supply Agreement"). If Purchaser has not obtained the necessary
operating permits and the Belgian Facility and Related Assets are not
transferred to Purchaser on or prior to the start of the fifth Annual Period,
then any Net Revenues Payments attributable to sales of Virginiamycin during
the fifth Annual Period that falls within the Belgium Interim will not be
paid to Pfizer but instead will be paid to an escrow agent mutually agreed to
by the parties and be invested    41   and held pursuant to an escrow
agreement acceptable to Pfizer, Purchaser and such escrow agent. If the
Belgian Facility and Related Assets are transferred to Purchaser or its
designated Affiliate on a date (the "Belgian Transfer Date") that is on or
prior to the last day of the fifth Annual Period, then any such escrowed
amounts, and all earnings therein (such escrowed amounts and earnings, the
"Escrowed Fund") will be paid to Pfizer within five (5) Business
Days following the Belgian Transfer Date. If the Belgian Transfer Date does
not occur on or prior to the end of the fifth Annual Period, then the
Escrowed Fund will be transferred to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days
of the end of the fifth Annual Period and the obligation of Purchaser to pay
Net Revenues Payments attributable to sales of Virginiamycin during the fifth
Annual Period shall be extinguished. If Purchaser obtains the necessary
operating permits for the transfer of the Belgian Facility and Related Assets
following the end of the fifth Annual Period, then Purchaser shall have the
option to purchase the Belgian Facility and Related Assets for a purchase
price equal to the amount of the Escrowed Fund. To exercise such option,
Purchaser must notify Pfizer in writing that it is exercising such option
within sixty (60) days of its receipt of the necessary operating permits for
the transfer of the Belgian Facility and Related Assets, and if Pfizer does
not receive a written notice of exercise within such sixty (60) day period,
such option shall lapse.   (ii) The parties further acknowledge that they
will not effect the transfer of the Conveyed Assets and assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities in China and Japan (such jurisdictions, the "Affected
Jurisdictions") until Purchaser is in a position to receive such Conveyed
Assets and assume such Assumed Liabilities, which will occur as soon as
reasonably practicable. Pfizer and Purchaser agree to effect the Closing
(including payment of the Closing Date Payment on the Closing Date and the
Net Revenues Payments and Royalty Payments on the dates such payments are
due), subject to the terms of this Agreement, with respect to all Conveyed
Assets and Assumed Liabilities outside of the Affected Jurisdictions on the
Closing Date. The obligations of the parties hereto set forth in this Section
7.3 shall continue with respect to the steps to closing in the Affected
Jurisdictions until all such steps have been taken and completed, at which
time the parties shall effect the transfer of the relevant Conveyed Assets.
As of the Closing Date, Pfizer and Purchaser shall, subject to applicable
Law, enter into a "net economic benefit" letter agreement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit J to provide Purchaser with the net economic
benefit or loss of the Business in the Affected Jurisdictions from and after
the Closing Date until transfer of the affected Conveyed Assets is
effected.   (e) If Virginiamycin is reinstated for sale in the European
Union (EU) after the Closing Date, Pfizer will provide reasonable assistance
to Purchaser, at Purchaser\'s request, in connection with Purchaser\'s re-
registration of certain claims for Virginiamycin as contemplated by Pfizer
as of the date of this Agreement. Pfizer\'s obligation to assist in such re-
registration process shall be subject to the availability of the
process described in Pfizer\'s confirmation letter of January 21, 2000 to the
EU Council regarding the provisions of EU Council Directive 96/51/EC.   
42    * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT  
Section 7.4 Employees and Employee Benefits.   (a) Employees (US) - Offer of
Employment; Continued Employment; Severance. Purchaser agrees to offer
employment as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing Date
to each Employee (US) in the same or a comparable position and at a rate of
pay at least equal to such Employee\'s rate of pay in effect on the Closing
Date and with benefits which shall be substantially comparable to the
employee benefits as are set forth in Schedule 7.4(a), and substantially
comparable to such other benefits as are set forth in the Employee Severance
Program (US) in Schedule 7.4(a)(i). For purposes of this Section 7.4,
references to "pay" shall include base pay plus any commission, bonus or
incentive pay, but excluding retention and retention/performance allowances.
Pfizer and Purchaser acknowledge that the pay and benefits described on
Schedule 7.4(a)(iv) would satisfy the "substantial comparability"
provisions of the first sentence of this Section 7.4(a). Such employment
shall be at a location within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of the
Employee\'s location of employment as of the Closing Date (which, in the case
of a sales Employee, shall mean such Employee\'s sales territory on the
Closing Date). Schedule 7.4(a)(ii) (which shall be updated by Pfizer on the
Closing Date) shall set forth the name of each Employee (US), and his or her
current rate of pay, position and date of hire. Purchaser shall have no
obligation whatsoever with regard to Employees who do not accept the offer of
employment or continuation of employment given by Purchaser in accordance
with this Section 7.4(a) and do not work for Purchaser or its Affiliates for
at least one (1) day, unless such Employee is otherwise an Affected Employee.
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all salaries or wages (including
bonuses, incentive payments and commissions) accruing after the Closing Date
with respect to the Affected Employees. Purchaser may, at its discretion,
change the conditions of employment after the Closing Date except for (i) the
location requirement described in this Section 7.4(a), (ii) the pay and
benefits comparability requirements described in this Section 7.4(a)
and (iii) separation plan obligations and other benefits described in
Schedule 7.4(a)(i), all of which matters shall remain unchanged until the
date immediately following the second anniversary of the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Purchaser or its Affiliates
may terminate an Employee (US) during such two (2) year period due
to "Performance-Related Terminations" or "Curtailment or Cessation
of Operations/Reorganization/Position Elimination" (as those terms are
described in Exhibit F, the Pfizer Employee Separation Plan) as long as
Purchaser or its Affiliates (i) first offers such Employee the opportunity to
sign a release agreement reasonably satisfactory to Pfizer, (ii) pays or
otherwise provides severance benefits to such Employee in accordance with
Pfizer\'s Employee Separation Plan and (iii) provides benefits continuation
and other benefits as set forth in Schedule 7.4(a)(i), provided, however,
that Purchaser or its Affiliates may terminate an Employee (US) without
paying or otherwise providing severance benefits to such Employee in
accordance with such policy and practice if such Employee is terminated, in
the reasonable discretion of Purchaser or its Affiliates, "for cause" (as
such term is defined in the Pfizer Employee Separation Plan).  [ * ] [ *
]    43    * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT  [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, immediately following the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall provide pay and benefits and severance plans, programs
and policies which are no less favorable than those provided to other
similarly situated employees of Purchaser, as the case may be. Employees also
shall be provided credit by Purchaser for all service with Pfizer and its
Affiliates, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by Pfizer and its Affiliates, under (x) all employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and fringe benefits of Purchaser described in Schedule 7.4(a)(iii)
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than under
the pension plan maintained by Purchaser) and (y) severance plans, programs
and policies for purposes of calculating the amount of each such Employee\'s
severance benefits.   (b) Qualified Plans.   (i) Pfizer sponsors the
following Plans which are intended to be  qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (collectively, the "Pfizer  Qualified Plans"): the Pfizer Savings
and Investment Plan (the "Savings  Plan") and the Pfizer Retirement Annuity
Plan (the "Retirement Plan").  Effective as of the Closing Date, the Asset
Selling Corporations shall  cause each Affected Employee who is a participant
in one or both Pfizer  Qualified Plans to become one hundred percent (100%)
vested in his or her  accrued benefit under each such Plan.   (ii)
Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the day immediately following the  Closing
Date, each participant in a Pfizer Qualified Plan who is an  Affected
Employee shall cease to be an active participant under each such  Plan to the
extent he or she becomes an employee of Purchaser, and shall  become a
participant in the Purchaser Qualified Plans as listed in  Schedule
7.4(b)(ii) (such plans being collectively referred to as the  "Purchaser
Qualified Plans"). Purchaser shall ensure that the Purchaser  Qualified Plans
will recognize the accrued service of each Affected  Employee to the extent
he or she becomes an employee of Purchaser with  Pfizer and its Affiliates up
to and including the Closing Date for  purposes of vesting and eligibility
only, to the extent credited under the  terms of the corresponding Pfizer
Qualified Plan as in effect on the  Closing Date. It is expressly agreed that
the Purchaser shall not grant to  Affected Employees past service credit for
purposes of benefit accrual  (including eligibility for early retirement
subsidies) under the Purchaser  defined benefit Qualified Plans. As soon as
practicable after the Closing  Date, Pfizer shall deliver such accrued
service data to Purchaser.   (iii) Pfizer will give Purchaser reasonable
access to records of  Pfizer necessary to administer the retirement benefits
of Affected  Employees.    44    (c) Accrued Entitlements. Purchaser
shall be responsible for all accrued entitlements, including vacation days,
for Affected Employees who become employees of Purchaser as of the Closing
Date consistent with Pfizer\'s policy in respect thereof. Purchaser shall
maintain Pfizer\'s vacation plan in effect through the end of calendar year
2001. Pfizer shall be responsible for the payment of bonuses earned by
Affected Employees through the Closing Date, such payments to be determined
based upon actual performance and the number of days elapsed in the year as
of the Closing Date in accordance with Pfizer\'s established incentive
compensation plans.   (d) Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations. At the
request of Purchaser (but without in any way limiting Purchaser\'s obligation
under subsection (a)) Pfizer will arrange for the Employees (US) to continue
to be covered under COBRA or otherwise at the applicable premium by Pfizer\'s
medical, dental, life and short and long term disability plans until such
time as such Employees (US) are covered by such plans maintained by
Purchaser. Purchaser shall pay for the costs of the foregoing COBRA
coverage.   (e) Employees (non-US) - Offer of Employment; Continued
Employment; Severance. (i) Purchaser agrees to offer employment as of 12:01
a.m. on the day immediately following the Closing Date to each Employee (non-
US) in the same or a comparable position and at a rate of pay at least equal
to such Employee\'s rate of pay in effect on the Closing Date and with
benefits which shall be substantially comparable to such Employee\'s benefits
which are in effect on the Closing Date. Pfizer and Purchaser acknowledge
that the pay and benefits described on Schedule 7.4(e)(i) would satisfy the
"substantial comparability" provisions of the preceding sentence. Schedule
7.4(e)(ii) hereto (which shall be updated by Pfizer on the Closing Date)
shall set forth the name of each Employee (non-US).   (ii) It is the
intention of the parties to this Agreement to deal with employee matters,
including, without limitation, offers of employment, compensation, benefits,
and severance payment and benefit continuation matters for Employees (non-US)
in a manner substantially similar to the manner in which Employees (US)
matters have been dealt with in this Article VII, subject to: (A) with regard
to each Pfizer Foreign Plan which is a defined contribution or benefit plan
(other than the Belgian and Brazilian pension plans), to either distribute or
retain (for the benefit of the Affected Employee) the account balance of each
Affected Employee (non-US) to the extent permitted by applicable local Law,
or, if not so permitted, such account balance will be dealt with in a manner
agreed to by the parties; (B) with regard to the Belgian pension plan, Pfizer
will transfer to the corresponding Purchaser Foreign Plan as soon
as practicable following the Closing Date Belgian pension plan assets
sufficient to satisfy the liability of the plan with respect to the
applicable Affected Employees, such liability to be calculated on a basis and
methodology to be agreed to by the parties between the date hereof and the
tenth Business Day prior to the Closing Date and (C) with regard to the
Brazilian pension plan, Laboratorios Pfizer do Brasil Ltda. will transfer
prior to the Closing Date plan assets attributable to the applicable Affected
Employees to the corresponding plan established by Phibro Saude International
Ltda. Within two weeks of    45   the signing of this Agreement, Pfizer
shall provide to Purchaser the following information and/or documents
relating to the assumptions for the basis of the asset transfer: (i) discount
rate assumed, (ii) salary increase rate assumed, (iii) inflation rate
assumed, (iv) retirement age assumptions, (v) assumed mortality table, (vi)
turnover rate assumed, (vii) assumptions as to form of benefits (lump sum,
annuity, or a combination of both) and all other related documents and/or
assumptions. Additionally, within two weeks of the signing of this Agreement,
Pfizer shall provide to Purchaser the following information with respect to
each Employee who participates in the Belgian Pension Plan: (i) name, (ii)
date of birth, (iii) date of hire, (iv) pensionable salary, and
(v) accumulated employee contributions. Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Pfizer, on the other hand, each agree to use its best efforts and to
cooperate with the other to effect as promptly as possible the transfers of
assets contemplated under this Section 7.4(e)(ii), subject to Pfizer\'s
receipt of satisfactory evidence that the Purchaser Foreign Plans are in
compliance with all relevant Laws; and (C) such modifications as are
necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and their
political subdivisions; applicable labor agreements; local Pfizer policies,
programs and practices; and established local business custom in similar
transactions; provided, however, that in no event shall Pfizer retain any
Liability with respect to any Foreign Plan with respect to Employees (non-US)
except to the extent that Pfizer retains assets in a funded Foreign Plan (as
a result of Pfizer electing not to transfer applicable plan assets to a
comparable plan of Purchaser) which provides for benefits for such Employees
(non-US).   (f) Employees (US) and Employees (non-US) Absent on Disability
or Leaves of Absence - Offer of Employment; Continued Employment; Severance.
When an Employee (US) or Employee (non-US) who is, on the Closing Date,
absent due to illness or on short-term disability (including maternity
disability) or workers\' compensation seeks to return to active employment,
Purchaser shall offer immediate employment to such Employee in the same or a
comparable position to that which the Employee occupied before such absence
but only at such time that such Employee is medically capable of performing
the essential functions of the position occupied immediately before such
absence. In addition, immediate employment in the same or comparable
positions will be offered to those Employees (US) and Employees (non-US)
returning from authorized leaves of absence such as parental, family and
medical, and military leaves or other leaves where return to work is subject
to statutory requirements. Such Employees, returning from disability or
leaves of absence, will be subject to the same pay, benefits, severance and
all other policies, plans, programs and arrangements as stipulated in this
Article VII for similarly situated Employees (US) and Employees (non-US) and,
in the case of Employees (non-US), as otherwise required by applicable local
Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall have no
obligations or Liabilities with respect to Employees on disability or other
leave who do not work for Purchaser for at least one day.   (g) Other
Matters. Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Employee of any Asset Selling Corporation any benefits under
any benefit plans, programs, policies or other arrangements, including, but
not    46   limited to, severance benefits or right to employment or
continued employment with Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser for any
period by reason of this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of this
Agreement, in particular this Article VII, are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and are not for the benefit of any other third
party.   Section 7.5 Bulk Transfer Laws. Purchaser acknowledges that
the Asset Selling Corporations have not taken, and do not intend to take, any
action required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws
or similar laws.   Section 7.6 Noncompetition.   (a) Subject to the
provisions of this Section 7.6, Pfizer agrees that for a period of five (5)
years from the Closing Date, Pfizer and its Affiliates shall not manufacture,
distribute or sell to the global livestock industry feed additive products
that are competitive with the Products ("Competitive Activity"); provided,
however, that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of this subsection (a)
for Pfizer or any of its Affiliates to (u) invest in or own any debt
securities or other debt obligations (other than convertible debt), (v)
invest in any third Person (including, without limitation, any corporation or
mutual or other fund) which invests in, manages or operates a Competitive
Activity, so long as such aggregate investment is less than twenty percent
(20%) of the outstanding equity interests in such third Person (taking into
account the conversion of any convertible securities held by Pfizer and any
of its Affiliates) and Pfizer and its Affiliates do not control such third
Person or control or conduct such Competitive Activity, (w) invest in, own an
interest in, or acquire all or a majority of the stock or assets of any
Person that is not "engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity"
(as hereinafter defined), subject to the divestiture requirement noted below
in subsection (b), (x) invest in securities having less than five percent
(5%) of the outstanding voting power of any Person, the securities of which
are publicly traded or listed on any securities exchange or automated
quotation system or (y) own any equity interests through any employee benefit
plan or pension plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the foregoing covenant shall not apply with respect to any Person
that acquires a majority of the stock or assets of Pfizer or any of its
Affiliates and that prior to such acquisition already was engaged in a
Competitive Activity. Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this subsection (a), Pfizer and its Affiliates shall not be
deemed to have violated the restrictions contained in this subsection (a) by
virtue of the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of certain Products
in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, provided that the Asset Selling
Corporation in India does not sell or export Products to any country other
than Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. For purposes of this subsection,
"engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity" shall mean that greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated net revenue derived during the last
complete fiscal year of the acquired Person is derived from a Competitive
Activity. Each investment or acquisition made by Pfizer or its Affiliates
which is subject to the provisions of this Section 7.6 must be permissible
hereunder at the time of such investment, provided, however, that any
such    47   investment which was permissible when made cannot
thereafter be the basis of a claim of violation of this Section 7.6.   (b)
Notwithstanding the exception described in clause (w) in subsection (a)
above, in the event that Pfizer or an Affiliate acquires or invests in any
Person that is not engaged primarily in a Competitive Activity but that
Person owns and conducts a Competitive Activity representing more than five
percent (5%) of the consolidated net revenue for the last complete
fiscal year of such Person, Pfizer or such Affiliate, subject to the
following sentence, thereafter shall divest such Person\'s Competitive
Activity within 24 months from the date of purchase. If Pfizer is required to
divest a portion of a Person that is not engaged primarily in a Competitive
Activity pursuant to the preceding sentence, Pfizer shall, prior to
soliciting offers from any other third party, give written notice thereof to
Purchaser and Purchaser will have twenty (20) days (which period can be
extended by mutual written agreement) from receipt of such notice to propose
an offer to acquire such Competitive Activity by delivery to Pfizer of a
written notice setting forth with specificity the principal terms of
Purchaser\'s offer (including, without limitation, the purchase price, the
form of consideration, any closing conditions and the closing date). If
Pfizer, in its sole discretion, elects to pursue Purchaser\'s offer, then
Pfizer and Purchaser agree to negotiate in good faith for thirty (30) days
(which period can be extended by mutual written agreement) to reach
a definitive agreement on mutually agreeable terms. If (i) Purchaser fails to
make an offer, (ii) Purchaser makes an offer that Pfizer elects not to pursue
or (iii) Purchaser makes an offer that Pfizer elects to pursue but Pfizer
and Purchaser do not come to mutual agreement by the end of the thirty (30)
day time period (as it may be extended) referenced above, then Pfizer shall
have the right to solicit proposals and negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with any third parties regarding the sale of such Competitive
Activity.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Section 7.6(a), Pfizer shall not be deemed to have violated the
provisions of Section 7.6(a) by reason of its acquisition of a Person engaged
primarily in a Competitive Activity if, prior to consummating such
acquisition, it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the to-be-
acquired Person\'s Competitive Activity to a third party. Pfizer hereby
grants Purchaser the same "right of first negotiation" arrangement previously
described in Section 7.6(b) prior to entering into any such agreement with a
third party to acquire the Competitive Activity of a Person engaged primarily
in a Competitive Activity.   (d) For a period of two (2) years after the
Closing Date, Pfizer and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly,
induce or attempt to induce any officers, employees, representatives or
agents of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates engaged solely in the
manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of the Products to leave the
employ of Purchaser or any such Affiliate, or violate the terms of their
contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Purchaser or any such
Affiliate, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict or preclude
the rights of Pfizer and its Affiliates to make generalized searches for
employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade
media)    48   or by engaging search firms to engage in searches that
are not targeted or focused on the employees engaged in such activities.  
(e) Purchaser agrees that for a period of five (5) years from the Closing
Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not distribute or sell or promote
the distribution and sale of any product that is competitive with Pfizer\'s
Strongid(R) product line as marketed on the date hereof in any country in
which such products are sold as of the date hereof. Such prohibition
shall include the sale by Purchaser of any active ingredient used in
Strongid(R) products to any third party who, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
is purchasing such active ingredient for the purpose of the manufacture,
distribution or sale of a product that is competitive with the Strongid(R)
line of products.   (f) Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise agreed in
writing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will offer or provide
employment on a full-time or part-time or consulting basis to any individual
employed by Pfizer or any of its Affiliates and engaged in the manufacture,
storage, distribution or sale of the Products. For a period of two (2) years
after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not, directly or
indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any officers, employees,
representatives or agents of Pfizer\'s Animal Health Group, or any employees
of Pfizer or any of its Affiliates which Purchaser, its representatives or
agents were introduced to in the connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to leave the employ of Pfizer or any such
Affiliate, or violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment
arrangements, with Pfizer or any such Affiliate, except that nothing in this
sentence shall restrict or preclude the rights of Purchaser and its
Affiliates to make generalized searches for employees by the use of
advertisements in the media (including trade media) or by engaging
search firms to engage in searches that are not targeted or focused on the
employees engaged in such activities.   (g) Pfizer and Purchaser
acknowledge that this Section 7.6 constitutes an independent covenant and
shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision
of this Agreement. Each of Pfizer and Purchaser has independently consulted
with its counsel and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set
forth in this Section 7.6 are reasonable and proper. It is the desire and
intent of the parties that the provisions of this Section 7.6 shall be
enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law. If all or
part of this Section 7.6 is held invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Each of the
parties agrees that in the event of a breach by a party of the provisions of
this Section 7.6, money damages would not be an adequate remedy and that the
other party shall be entitled to seek temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages or posting a bond.
If any part of this Section 7.6 is held to be excessively broad as to
duration, scope, activity or subject, such part will be construed by limiting
and reducing it so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with
applicable Law.    49    Section 7.7 Transitional Services. At the
Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer shall enter into, execute and deliver a
transitional services agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to each of them substantially upon the principal terms set forth in Exhibit C
(the "Transitional Services Agreement").   Section 7.8 Trademark License
Agreements. (a) At the Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer shall enter into,
execute and deliver a transitional trademark and tradename license agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them substantially
upon the principal terms set forth in Exhibit D-1 (the "Transitional
Trademark and Tradename License Agreement").   (b) At the Closing, Purchaser
and Pfizer shall enter into, execute and deliver an agreement pursuant to
which Pfizer will grant Purchaser a trademark license for Terramycin(R),
Terramycine(R), Terramicina(R), Neo Terramycin(R), Neo Terramycine(R), Neo
Terramicina(R), Neo Terramix(R) and Terramix(R) in all countries of the
world, other than India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them substantially upon the
principal terms set forth in Exhibit D-2 (the "Trademark License Agreement
(Pfizer to Purchaser)").   (c) At the Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer shall
enter into, execute and deliver an agreement pursuant to which Purchaser will
grant Pfizer and its Affiliates a trademark license solely to the extent of
products marketed on the date of this Agreement for Banminth(R), Pro-
Banminth(R), Mecadox(R) and Vibravet (R), in all countries of the world in
connection with the sale of non-feed formulations. Such arrangement shall be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them substantially
upon the principal terms set forth in Exhibit D-3 (the "Trademark License
Agreement (Purchaser to Pfizer)").   Section 7.9 Supply and Tolling
Agreement. At the Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer shall enter into, execute and
deliver a supply and tolling agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to each of them substantially upon the principal terms set forth
in Exhibit E (the "Pfizer Supply and Tolling Agreement"), pursuant to which
Pfizer shall provide Purchaser certain supply and tolling services for a
specified period after the Closing Date.   Section 7.10 Compliance with
WARN, Etc. With respect to WARN or other similar statutes or regulations of
any jurisdiction, Purchaser will timely give any notices required to be given
thereunder.   Section 7.11 Foreign Implementing Agreements. As promptly
as practicable after the date hereof, Pfizer and Purchaser shall cause any
Foreign Implementing Agreements deemed necessary by the parties to be
prepared and executed by their applicable Affiliates.   Section 7.12
Litigation Support. Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Pfizer
and its Affiliates, on the other hand, will cooperate with each other
in    50   the defense or settlement of any Liabilities (including,
without limitation, Product Claims) or lawsuits involving the Products for
which they have responsibility under this Agreement by providing the other
party and such other party\'s legal counsel and other Persons access to
employees, records, documents, data, equipment, facilities, products, parts,
prototypes and other information regarding the Products as such other party
may request, to the extent maintained or under the possession or control of
the requested party. The requesting party shall reimburse the other party for
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties in performing its
obligations under this Section 7.12. Pfizer shall keep Purchaser informed of
the status of the pendency of the relevant Liabilities and lawsuits involving
the Products for which it has responsibility under this Agreement, will
advise Purchaser of material issues involved in the litigation and will use
its reasonable best efforts to seek a confidentiality agreement with respect
to any settlements of such lawsuits. For so long as any Liabilities or
lawsuits involving the Products for which Pfizer has responsibility under
this Agreement remain outstanding, Purchaser will advise Pfizer of material
issues involved in the lawsuits involving the Products for which it has
responsibility and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek a
confidentiality agreement with respect to any settlements of
such lawsuits.   Section 7.13 Insurance; Workers\' Compensation. As of the
Closing Date, the coverage under all insurance policies related to the
manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of the Products and all workers\'
compensation policies related to the Employees (which coverage shall be
maintained by Pfizer from the date hereof through the Closing Date) shall
continue in force only for the benefit of the Asset Selling Corporations and
their Affiliates and not for the benefit of Purchaser. Purchaser agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the manufacture,
storage, distribution and sale of the Products and workers\' compensation
policies with respect to the Employees, in each case covering all periods and
agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of Asset Selling
Corporations\' or their Affiliates\' insurance policies or workers\'
compensation policies which may provide coverage for claims relating in any
way to the manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of the Products or the
Employees on or prior to the Closing Date.   Section 7.14 Scheduled
Environmental Commitments. (a) Pfizer has agreed to retain the environmental
liabilities associated with the covenants set forth in Section 7.14 and
Schedule 7.14 ("Scheduled Environmental Commitments") and shall undertake the
Scheduled Environmental Commitments in prompt and expeditious fashion. After
the Closing, all decisions relating to the Scheduled Environmental
Commitments shall be made by Pfizer. Pfizer shall consult with Purchaser on
all material decisions relating to Scheduled Environmental Commitments,
including but not limited, retention of a qualified environmental consultant,
negotiations with regulatory authorities, the development of work plans, and
draft and final reports. Pfizer shall keep Purchaser regularly informed
concerning its undertaking of the Scheduled Environmental Commitments and
shall consult regularly with Purchaser, and solicit Purchaser\'s comments,
on the development and implementation of the plans for the undertaking of
the Scheduled Environmental Commitments. Pfizer shall seriously consider
Purchaser\'s    51   comments on its plans or proposals and shall use
reasonable efforts to incorporate Purchaser\'s reasonable comments into the
development and implementation of the plans for the undertaking of the
Scheduled Environmental Commitments. Pfizer shall comply with all applicable
Environmental Laws with respect to the Scheduled Environmental Commitments,
and will provide to Purchaser copies of all material written notices,
correspondence with and submissions to Governmental Authorities, work plans,
data, sampling results and final reports concerning the Scheduled
Environmental Commitments. Pfizer shall, to the extent practicable, minimize
the disruptive impact of Scheduled Environmental Commitments upon the
operations of Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide Pfizer, its agents,
employees, and consultants with reasonable access to the Facilities to carry
out the Scheduled Environmental Commitments, which shall be at Pfizer\'s cost
and expense, and upon reasonable notice to Purchaser. In addition to the
costs and expenses of the Scheduled Environmental Commitments, Pfizer shall
be responsible only for Purchaser\'s reasonable costs and expenses associated
with the implementation of Scheduled Environmental Commitments. Purchaser
will cooperate with Pfizer in the implementation of Scheduled Environmental
Commitments, including providing reasonable access to employees and documents
as necessary. In addition, Purchaser will provide a reasonable level of
facility staff support to Pfizer consistent with past practice in connection
with its completion of the emission control project regarding an
air pollution abatement system at the Belgian Facility.   (b) Section 8.11
shall govern with respect to the Applicable Remedial Action Standard and the
standard for determining completion of the Remedial Actions set forth on
Schedule 7.14.   Section 7.15 Guarulhos Site Services Agreement. At the
Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer shall enter into, execute and deliver a site
services agreement relating to the Guarulhos, Brazil Facility in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them substantially upon the
principal terms set forth in Exhibit I (the "Guarulhos Site Services
Agreement").   Section 7.16 European Communities and Denmark Actions.
Purchaser acknowledges that Pfizer has previously commenced an action in the
Court of First Instance of the European Communities challenging the validity
of Council Regulation No. 2821/98 which, inter alia, withdrew the
authorization pursuant to Directive 70/524/EEC for the use of Virginiamycin
as a feed additive for growth promotion in the European Union and that there
are two (2) actions pending in Denmark as set forth on Schedule 7.16 relating
to Virginiamycin (collectively, the "Virginiamycin Actions"). Purchaser
agrees that, after the Closing Date, Pfizer shall continue to control the
prosecution of the Virginiamycin Actions and Purchaser agrees to make its
personnel available to Pfizer to provide assistance to Pfizer on matters
related to the actions and provide Pfizer, its agents, employees or
consultants access to its books and records as they may relate to the actions
until such time as (i) Pfizer obtains a favorable or final non-appealable
judgment or (ii) Pfizer abandons the actions. Purchaser agrees that Pfizer
shall have no obligation to continue to prosecute the Virginiamycin Actions
and can abandon any of the actions at any time in its sole
discretion, provided that Pfizer agrees to    52   provide notice to
Purchaser of any decision to abandon any such action. If Pfizer determines to
abandon one or more of the Virginiamycin Actions, Pfizer shall, at
Purchaser\'s request, assign to Purchaser, to the extent practicable, any
rights it may have with respect to any such action so that Purchaser
can continue to prosecute the action in Pfizer\'s stead. In such event,
Purchaser shall control the prosecution of any such action abandoned by
Pfizer and Pfizer agrees, at the expense of Purchaser, to make its personnel
available in response to reasonable requests of Purchaser to provide
assistance to Purchaser on matters related to any such action and to provide
Purchaser, its agents, employees or consultants, reasonable access to its
books and records as they relate to any such action. Pfizer will provide
Purchaser with status updates regarding the Virginiamycin Actions on a semi-
annual basis or as material developments occur.   Section 7.17 Aviax
mycelium (US). Pfizer will conduct, report and submit to the Center for
Veterinarian Medicine ("CVM") within 12 months of the Closing, all studies
indicated in the most recent "incomplete letters" relating to Aviax mycelium
(US) from the CVM. Pfizer will provide answers to any follow-up questions
that result from the response to the aforementioned incomplete letters. At
such time that CVM acknowledges that a satisfactory response has been
provided to the current incomplete letters and there are no additional
questions stemming from Pfizer\'s response to follow-up questions, Purchaser
will assume full regulatory and development responsibilities for any new
questions and for the administrative approval of Aviax
(semduramicin) mycelium. Pfizer will be available to serve on a consulting
basis for any additional questions that may be raised by the CVM. However,
Pfizer will not be required to and will not bear additional costs associated
with study conduct. In the event that a question is posed that can only be
answered by using Pfizer internal expertise, the parties will discuss a
mutually agreeable manner in which to proceed.   Section 7.18 Regulatory
Matters. Subject to the provisions of the Transitional Services Agreement,
upon transfer of the Product Registrations to Purchaser, Purchaser shall
assume the regulatory responsibilities applicable to the owner of the
Products, reporting and otherwise, except such responsibilities as Pfizer may
have under applicable Law. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, Pfizer shall maintain an archival copy of all
clinical studies, data, and reports transferred pursuant to this
Agreement.   Section 7.19 Certain Manufacturing Rights. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including, without limitation,
Section 7.6 hereof, Purchaser agrees that Pfizer from and after the Closing
Date may continue to manufacture in Taiwan certain non-medicated premixes
listed on Schedule 7.19 hereof, which manufactured premixes Purchaser shall
have the option to purchase and distribute at such price and other terms as
to be mutually agreed between Pfizer and Purchaser. If Purchaser does not
elect to purchase and distribute the manufactured premixes or the parties do
not reach mutually agreeable terms, Pfizer shall have the right to sell the
manufactured premixes to any one or more third Persons on such terms as
Pfizer may determine in its sole discretion.    53    * OMITTED
PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   Section 7.20
Supply/Distribution Agreements. At the Closing, Purchaser and Pfizer shall
enter into, execute and deliver supply and/or distribution agreements in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of them substantially upon the
principal terms set forth in Exhibits L-1 and L-2 (the "Supply/Distribution
Agreements") in respect of the supply and distribution of the Products for
sale in Egypt and India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. With respect to
Taiwan and Zimbabwe, Purchaser will continue to negotiate the terms of
distribution arrangements in these countries with the Pfizer employees who
expect to take over the distribution of Products, with a target
for completing those negotiations by thirty (30) days after the execution of
this Agreement. Upon the Closing, if the employees in Taiwan and Zimbabwe are
not in a position to distribute Products on behalf of Purchaser, Pfizer will
either enter into substantially identical distribution agreements with
Purchaser and assign these agreements to the employees (or their designated
entities) when they are in a position to distribute Purchaser\'s Products or,
if mutually agreed by both parties, operate the Business in these countries
under the terms of a "net economic benefit" letter agreement in substantially
the form of Exhibit J with appropriate revisions to be agreed to by the
parties.   Section 7.21 (a) [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ *

]   Section 7.23 Lee\'s Summit Additional Support Services. Pfizer
shall provide technical support to Purchaser to assist in the transfer of
production of Product to alternative sources of supply as designated by
Purchaser. Purchaser will provide Pfizer with the details of its plans for
the transfer within ninety(90) days after the Closing Date, including the
sources of commercial neomycin sulfate and OTC (which will include samples
for evaluation), a list of all of the formulations that Pfizer will be asked
to assist in qualifying and the name of the laboratory that Pfizer will be
asked to assist in qualifying. As a part of this support, Pfizer shall
provide, at no cost to Purchaser, analytical/laboratory and manufacturing
services to support the following projects: (i) substitution of Sandwich, UK-
sourced TMQ for Terre Haute-sourced TMQ; (ii) replacement of Terre Haute-
sourced Neomycin Sulfate with purchased Neomycin Sulfate; (iii) substitution
of purchased OTC base for TMQ; (iv) alternate formulation site approvals, and
(v) alternate lab approvals, all to the extent as set forth on Schedule 7.23.
Purchaser acknowledges that the provision by Pfizer of the services provided
for in this Section 7.23 will not guarantee the receipt by Purchaser of the
necessary FDA approvals for the transfer of production or that Purchaser
otherwise will be successful in achieving its goals with respect to these
projects.   Section 7.24 Limitations on Refinancings, Etc. For so long as
any amounts remain outstanding under the Purchaser\'s Note, Purchaser agrees
that it will not (x) refinance, replace or modify the debt and equity
facilities under the PNC Credit Agreement and/or Palladium Preferred Stock or
(y) enter into new arrangements with debt and/or equity financing sources, in
each case on terms that would be, in the reasonable judgment of Pfizer, less
favorable as they relate to the priority of payment of, collateral security
for, and payment schedule of the Purchaser\'s Note than the terms of the
borrowings under the PNC Credit Agreement and the Palladium Preferred
Stock.   Section 7.25 Morantel/Pyrantel. [ * ]  [ * ] [ * ] [ * ] [ *

Indemnification by Pfizer.   (a) Pfizer, on behalf of itself and the Asset
Selling Corporations, agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, agents,
employees, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of
action, judgments, awards, liabilities, losses, costs or damages, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees (collectively, a "Loss" or, the "Losses") claimed
or arising from: (i) any Retained Liability, (ii) any Excluded Environmental

Corporations of any of their respective covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any Sellers\' Document, including, without limitation,
the Rixensart Agreement, (iv) any breach of any warranty or representation of
Pfizer contained in this Agreement or in any Sellers\' Document, including,
without limitation, the Rixensart Agreement or (v) Pfizer\'s failure to
comply with the covenants set forth in Section 7.14 and Schedule 7.14.  
(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Pfizer shall not have
any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Environmental
Liability to the extent that such Environmental Liability arises out of any
negligent actions taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing
Date, except to the extent Purchaser\'s action is required by Law or the
requirements of a Governmental Authority. Purchaser shall take and shall
cause its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article VIII, Pfizer shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser or its
Affiliates for any Loss under Section 8.1(a)(ii) that falls under
subparagraphs (iii), (iv) or (vi) of the definition of Excluded Environmental
Liabilities or is an Environmental Liability set forth in Schedule 7.14
following the completion of the Scheduled Environmental Commitment relating
thereto, except to the extent any such Environmental Liability exceeds, with
respect to subparagraphs (iii) or (vi) only of the definition of Excluded
Environmental Liability, $25,000 for any individual Environmental Liability
(i.e., this individual Environmental Liability threshold does not apply to
fines and penalties covered by subparagraph (iv)) or, with respect to
subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the definition of Excluded
Environmental Liability, $100,000 for all such Losses, in the aggregate, and
then further subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 to
the extent applicable. Further, the obligation of Pfizer to indemnify
Purchaser or its Affiliates for any Environmental Liability under Section
8.1(a)(iv) by reason of a breach of any representation or warranty contained
in Section 5.10 hereof shall be subject to the same provisions of
this Article VIII as are applicable to Pfizer\'s obligation to indemnify
Purchaser or its Affiliates for any such Environmental Liability under
Section 8.1(a)(ii)    57   that also would constitute an Excluded
Environmental Liability (e.g., any such breach that is of a nature that falls
under subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the definition of Excluded
Environmental Liabilities would be subject to the provisions of the preceding
sentence).   Section 8.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.   (a) Purchaser
agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Pfizer and the other Asset
Selling Corporations and their Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, agents, employees, successors and permitted assigns from and
against any and all Losses claimed or arising directly from (i) any Assumed
Liability, (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements
in this Agreement or in any Purchaser\'s Document or (iii) any breach of any
warranty or representation of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any
Purchaser\'s Document.   (b) Pfizer and the other Asset Selling Corporations
shall take and shall cause their respective Affiliates to take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.  
Section 8.3 Notice of Claims.   (a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified
under this Article VIII (the "Indemnified Party") has suffered or incurred
any Loss, the Indemnified Party shall so notify the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing
describing such Loss, the amount or estimated amount thereof, if known or
reasonably capable of estimation, and the method of computation of such Loss,
all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or
certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss shall
have occurred. If any action at Law or suit in equity is instituted by or
against a third party with respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to
claim any liability or expense as a Loss under this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such action
or suit and tender the Indemnified Party the defense of such action or suit.
A failure to give notice and to tender the defense of the action or suit in a
timely manner pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall not limit the obligation of
the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII, except (i) to the extent
such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby, (ii) to the extent expenses
are incurred during the period in which notice was not provided, and (iii)
as provided by Section 8.5 below.   (b) Except when a notice, report or
other filing must be filed immediately pursuant to Environmental Laws,
Purchaser will provide notice and an opportunity to comment to Pfizer before
Purchaser files any Required Governmental Report or any other report,
notification or filing with any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with an event that would be reasonably likely to result in a Loss
subject to the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII. In the event
Purchaser is    58   required to file a Required Governmental Report or
any other report, notification or filing immediately, Purchaser will provide
simultaneous notice to Pfizer when it files the report with the Governmental
Authority. Failure to comply with this Section 8.3(b) shall only affect
Pfizer\'s obligation under this Article VIII to the extent that Pfizer is
materially prejudiced by the failure to have been provided timely notice.  
Section 8.4 Third Party Claims.   (a) The Indemnifying Party under this
Article VIII shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct and
control, through counsel of its choosing, any third party claim, action or
suit (a "Third Party Claim"), and the Indemnifying Party may compromise or
settle the same, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party advance notice of any proposed compromise of settlement. No
Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third Party Claim for which it
is seeking indemnification hereunder without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in, but not control, the defense of any such action or suit
through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to, or fails within forty-five (45) days
of receipt of written notice from the Indemnified Party of a Third Party
Claim to, control or conduct the defense or prosecution of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control the
defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim and, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to employ counsel for such purpose chosen by the
Indemnified Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party.  
(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the making
available of employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing
additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.   Section 8.5 Expiration. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Closing shall have occurred, all covenants,
agreements, warranties and representations made herein or in any Sellers\'
Document or Purchaser\'s Document delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the
Closing indefinitely, but all representations and warranties made herein or
in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and all indemnification
obligations under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 with respect to any such
representation or warranty, shall terminate and expire on, and no action or
proceeding seeking damages or other relief for breach of any thereof or for
any misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect thereto shall be commenced
after, the second anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to all claims
of any party, and of any indemnified persons under this Article VIII, unless
written notice thereof shall have been previously given to the Indemnifying
Party under Section 8.3; provided, however, (x) as to indemnification
obligations under Section 8.1(a)(ii) with respect to subparagraphs (i) and
(ii) of the definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities, such
obligations shall not terminate and    59   shall not expire and shall
survive indefinitely, (y) as to indemnification obligations under Section
8.1(a)(ii) with respect to subparagraphs (iii) and (vi) of the definition of
Excluded Environmental Liabilities, such obligations shall terminate and
expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking damages, relief or indemnity
with respect thereto shall be commenced, after the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date unless written notice thereof shall have been previously given
to Pfizer under Section 8.3, (yy) as to indemnification obligations under
Section 8.1(a)(ii) with respect to subparagraph (iv) of the definition of
Excluded Environmental Liabilities, such obligations shall terminate and
expire on, and no action or proceedings seeking damages, relief or indemnity
with respect thereto shall be commenced after the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date and (z) as to indemnification obligations under
Section 8.1(a)(ii) with respect to subparagraph (v) of the definition of
Excluded Environmental Liabilities that arise following completion of the
Scheduled Environmental Commitments set forth in Section 7.14, such
obligations shall terminate and expire and no action or proceeding seeking
damages, relief or indemnity with respect thereto shall be commenced, after
the fifth anniversary following completion of the Scheduled Environmental
Commitments, unless written notice thereof shall have been previously given
to Pfizer under Section 8.3; and (zz) as to indemnification obligations under
Sections 8.1(a)(iv) and 8.2(a)(iii), such obligations shall terminate and
expire on, and no action or proceeding seeking damages, relief or indemnity
with respect thereto shall be commenced, after the second anniversary of the
Closing Date (except for actions or proceedings relating to the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.2 and 5.14, which
shall survive indefinitely, and Section 5.10, which shall survive until the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date), unless written notice thereof shall
have been previously given to the Indemnifying Party under Section 8.3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Belgian Facility is not transferred to
Purchaser within six months from the Closing, then Pfizer\'s obligations to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of subparagraphs
(iii), (iv) and (vi) of the definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities
and breaches of Section 5.10, in each case pertaining to occurrences at the
Belgian Facility, shall, instead of expiring on the fifth and
sixth anniversaries of the Closing Date as provided above, instead expire on
the fifth and sixth anniversaries, respectively, after the transfer date of
the Belgian Facility.   Section 8.6 Certain Limitations. (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) Pfizer shall
not have any obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party under
Section 8.1(a) (iv) for Losses unless the aggregate of all such Losses for
which Pfizer would, but for this provision, be liable exceeds on a cumulative
basis $750,000, in which event Pfizer shall be responsible only for Losses in
excess of $750,000 and (B) Pfizer shall not have any obligation to indemnify
any Purchaser Indemnified Party under Section 8.1(a) (iv) for Losses on a
cumulative basis, including Losses incurred by any other Purchaser
Indemnified Party, in excess of an amount equal to the Closing Date Payment
less any (x) reductions in the principal amount of the Purchaser\'s Note, (y)
credits against the payments otherwise due and owing pursuant to Section
2.6(b), and (z) payments made by Pfizer to Purchaser, each of (x), (y) and
(z) pursuant to Section 2.7(d).    60    (b) With respect to
Environmental Claims (as defined herein) seeking additional Remedial Action
arising from unknown or unforeseen conditions related to a Scheduled
Environmental Commitment following the completion of such Scheduled
Environmental Commitment, Pfizer\'s indemnification obligations shall be
subject to the following cost sharing: (i) if an Environmental Claim
is asserted in the first year following completion of a Scheduled
Environmental Commitment, Pfizer shall bear seventy-five percent (75%) of the
costs and Purchaser twenty-five percent (25%) of the costs; (ii) if an
Environmental Claim is asserted in the second or third year following
completion of a Scheduled Environmental Commitment, Pfizer shall bear fifty
percent (50%) of the costs and Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the costs;
and (iii) if an Environmental Claim is asserted in the fourth or fifth year
following completion of a Scheduled Environmental Commitment, Pfizer shall
bear twenty-five percent (25%) of the costs and Purchaser seventy-five
percent (75%) of the costs. With respect to any Environmental Claims asserted
in the sixth year or thereafter following completion of a Scheduled
Environmental Commitment, Purchaser shall bear all costs of additional
Remedial Actions. For purposes of this Section, "Environmental Claim" means
any notice of violation, action, claim, demand, abatement or other order or
direction (conditional or otherwise) arising under Environmental Laws by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person.   Section 8.7 Losses Net of
Insurance, Etc. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided
under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 (the "Specified Sections") shall be net of (i) any
amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by
or indemnification agreement with any third Person, (ii) any insurance
proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received from any
third Person as an offset against such Loss (each Person named in clauses (i)
and (ii), a "Collateral Source"), and (iii) an amount equal to the value of
the Tax benefit, if any, attributable to such Loss recognized and received by
Purchaser in the year in which the indemnification payment is recognized and
received by Purchaser. Indemnification under this Article VIII shall not be
available to Purchaser or Pfizer, as the case may be, unless the party
seeking indemnification under this Article VIII first uses all reasonable
efforts to seek recovery from all Collateral Sources. The Indemnifying Party
may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights to seek recovery
pursuant to the preceding sentence to the Indemnifying Party; provided, that
the Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing such claim
at its own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment
required under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 is determined after payment by the
Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any
amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
Article VIII had such determination been made at the time of such payment.
All amounts paid by Pfizer or Purchaser under this Article VIII shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except to
the extent such treatment is not recognized by applicable Tax Governmental
Authorities, in which case the Indemnifying Party\'s indemnification
obligation shall be increased such that the indemnification payment less the
income    61   Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party with respect to
the inclusion of such amount in the Indemnified Party\'s Taxable income
equals the Loss giving rise to the indemnification payment.   Section 8.8
Other Limitations. No claim for breach of representation or warranty shall be
made by Purchaser under Section 8.1(a)(iv) if Closing occurs and (a) such
claim is based on a fact or an event occurring prior to Closing (whether or
not also occurring prior to the date of this Agreement), (b) such fact or
event was disclosed to Purchaser by Pfizer in writing prior to Closing and
(c) such fact or event would render the condition precedent set forth in
Section 4.2(a) incapable of being satisfied on the date it was disclosed to
Purchaser.   Section 8.9 Sole Remedy/Waiver. Other than the remedies
available in respect of the Rixensart Agreement, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall
be the parties\' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights,
claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
that it may have against the Asset Selling Corporations or any of their
Affiliates, or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including,
without limitation, any such Law relating to environmental matters or arising
under or based upon any securities Law, common law or otherwise). The
Rixensart Agreement shall be the sole remedy for Purchaser regarding Remedial
Action at that Facility that was not attributable to Pfizer.   Section 8.10
Indemnification Procedures for Remedial Actions on Conveyed Properties.  
(a) Other than Scheduled Environmental Commitments set forth in Section 7.14
and Schedule 7.14, Pfizer shall have the right but not the obligation to
conduct and control the management of a Remedial Action at a property
included in the Conveyed Assets (a "Conveyed Property") that is subject to a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Pfizer must
notify Purchaser, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of
Purchaser\'s claim for indemnification for such matter, that (i) it intends
to undertake said responsibility or (ii) that more information is needed from
Purchaser before Pfizer can reasonably determine that Purchaser\'s claim is
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser shall
promptly respond to such requests for information (to the extent such
information is reasonably available to Purchaser) and, within thirty (30)
days of receipt of such information, Pfizer shall notify Purchaser as to
whether it shall undertake the Remedial Action. Prior to a determination by
Pfizer that it will undertake a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section
8.10, Purchaser shall take only those actions necessary to comply with
applicable Environmental Laws or the requirements of a Governmental Authority
or to address conditions that pose an imminent risk to health or the
environmental, unless any other actions are approved by Pfizer.   
62    (b) In undertaking a Remedial Action pursuant to this Section
8.10, Pfizer shall retain a qualified independent environmental consultant,
which consultant shall be subject to Purchaser\'s approval (such approval not
to be unreasonably delayed or withheld). Pfizer shall undertake such Remedial
Action in a prompt and expeditious fashion in accordance with applicable
Environmental Laws and shall not cause, through its own inaction, any undue
delay in obtaining and shall obtain written notice from the appropriate
Governmental Authority that no further Remedial Action is necessary with
respect to the matter that is the subject of the indemnification claim to
meet the Applicable Remedial Action Standards, or, if no Governmental
Authority is involved in such matter, the standard set forth in Section 8.11
for determining when a Remedial Action being undertaken by Pfizer is
completed shall govern. Pfizer shall comply with all applicable Laws,
including all applicable Environmental Laws, with respect to its performance
pursuant to this Section 8.10. All decisions relating to such Remedial Action
shall be made by Pfizer. Pfizer shall consult with Purchaser on all material
decisions relating to such Remedial Action, including but not limited to,
negotiations with regulatory authorities and the development
and implementation of work plans. Pfizer shall keep Purchaser regularly
informed concerning its undertaking of such Remedial Action and shall consult
regularly with Purchaser, and solicit Purchaser\'s comments, on the
development and implementation of the plans for the undertaking of such
Remedial Action. Pfizer shall seriously consider Purchaser\'s comments on its
plans or proposals and shall use reasonable efforts to incorporate
Purchaser\'s reasonable comments into the development and implementation of
the plans for the undertaking of such Remedial Action. Pfizer shall provide
to Purchaser copies of all material written notices, correspondence with and
submissions to Governmental Authorities, work plans, data, sampling results
and final reports concerning such Remedial Action. Pfizer shall, to the
extent practicable, minimize the disruptive impact of such Remedial Action
upon the operations of Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide Pfizer, its agents,
employees, and consultants with reasonable access to the Facilities to carry
out such Remedial Action, which shall be at Pfizer\'s expense and upon
reasonable notice to Purchaser. Purchaser will cooperate with Pfizer in the
implementation of such Remedial Action, including providing reasonable access
to employees and documents as necessary.   (c) Except with respect to
Scheduled Environmental Commitments set forth on Schedule 7.14, to which this
subparagraph does not apply, if Pfizer declines to undertake the performance
of a Remedial Action as provided in Section 8.10(a), Purchaser shall be
entitled to undertake the Remedial Action to bring the Conveyed Property into
conformance with the Applicable Remedial Action Standards. Purchaser shall
promptly provide copies to Pfizer of all notices, correspondence, draft
reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give Pfizer a
reasonable opportunity (at Pfizer\'s own expense) to comment on any material
submissions Purchaser intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate
Governmental Authority prior to said submission. Pfizer may, at its own
expense, hire its own consultants, attorneys or other professionals
to monitor the Remedial Action, including any field work undertaken by
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall provide to Pfizer the results of all such
field work. Notwithstanding the above, Pfizer shall not take any actions that
shall unreasonably interfere with Purchaser\'s    63   performance of
the Remedial Action. Pfizer\'s decision to allow Purchaser to undertake any
Remedial Action hereunder shall not limit or affect Pfizer\'s obligation to
indemnify Purchaser for said Remedial Action to bring the Conveyed Property
into conformance with the Applicable Remedial Action Standards as otherwise
provided in this Agreement.   Section 8.11 Limitation on Indemnification for
Remedial Action.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, with respect to Pfizer\'s indemnification obligations under
Section 8.1(a)(ii) with respect to subparagraphs (iii) and (v) of the
definition of Excluded Environmental Liabilities and those indemnification
obligations related to a Scheduled Environmental Commitment following the
completion of such Scheduled Environmental Commitment: (x) Pfizer shall be
responsible for the costs of such Remedial Action only to the extent
necessary to meet the least stringent, most cost-effective standard required
by applicable Environmental Law and consistent with the use of the Facility
or Conveyed Property as of the Closing Date, or a standard pursuant to
applicable Environmental Laws acceptable to the relevant Governmental
Authorities with jurisdiction over the Remedial Action (the "Applicable
Remedial Action Standard"), (y) Pfizer shall not be responsible for those
costs incurred in connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such costs
arise from or are exacerbated by any negligent acts or omissions
of Purchaser, (z) except with respect to Scheduled Environmental
Commitments, Pfizer shall not be responsible for costs incurred in connection
with a Remedial Action, unless such Remedial Action is pursuant to a Third
Party Claim or a violation of Environmental Law posing a non-trivial risk of
harm to health, safety or the environment reasonably likely to exceed $25,000
to cure or address the violation and (zz) Pfizer shall be responsible only
for Purchaser\'s reasonable costs and expenses associated with the
implementation of Pfizer\'s obligations.   (b) With respect to any Remedial
Actions undertaken by Pfizer under this Agreement, including the Remedial
Actions scheduled on Schedule 7.14 and any Remedial Action Pfizer elects to
undertake pursuant to Section 8.10, Pfizer\'s obligations to perform such
Remedial Action shall be deemed to be complete: (x) upon receipt of written
notice from the relevant Governmental Authority indicating that no further
Remedial Action is required to be conducted (a "Governmental Sign-off") or,
(y) if no Governmental Authority has asserted jurisdiction or if for any
other reason a Governmental Sign-off is not obtainable, when Pfizer\'s and
Purchaser\'s environmental consultants jointly agree, in writing, that the
Remedial Action has been completed in accordance with the Applicable Remedial
Action Standard; provided, however, that if Pfizer\'s and Purchaser\'s
environmental consultants are unable to reach such a joint agreement, then
Pfizer\'s and Purchaser\'s environmental consultants shall jointly select an
independent third environmental consultant (the "Independent Consultant")
acceptable to each of them and that Independent Consultant shall review all
relevant information provided by Pfizer and Purchaser and shall make a
determination, which determination shall be binding on both Pfizer
and Purchaser, as to whether the Remedial Action has achieved the
Applicable Remedial Action Standard and no further action is required. In the
event the Independent Consultant finds that additional work is required, the
scope and extent of that work shall be negotiated by the parties. All fees,
costs and expenses of the    64   Independent Consultant shall be borne
equally (50% each) by Pfizer and Purchaser.   Section 8.12 No Consequential
Damages.   NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NO
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIABLE TO OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE TO ANY
OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ANY AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO FOR
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH THEREOF OR ANY LIABILITY RETAINED
OR ASSUMED HEREUNDER.   ARTICLE IX   TERMINATION   Section 9.1
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:   (a) by written agreement of Purchaser and Pfizer;   (b) by
either Purchaser or Pfizer, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to March
31, 2001 (unless the failure to consummate the Closing by such date shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have
fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement); or   (c) by either
Pfizer or Purchaser if any United States court of competent jurisdiction or
other competent United States Governmental Authority shall have issued a
Governmental Order or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Governmental Order or other action shall have become final
and nonappealable.   Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.   (a) In the event
of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof,
this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party
hereto shall have any liability to the other party hereto or their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of
the parties hereto contained in this Section 9.2 and in Sections 7.1(a),
10.1, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9 and 10.11 hereof, and except that nothing herein will
relieve any party from Liability for any breach of any covenant set forth in
this Agreement prior to such termination.   (b) In the event this Agreement
shall be terminated and at such time any party is in material breach of or
default under any term or provision hereof, such termination shall be without
prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and all rights to   
65   damages that the other party may have hereunder or otherwise under
applicable Law. The damages recoverable by the non-defaulting party shall
include, without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding
sentence, all attorneys\' fees and brokerage, finder\'s or other advisory
fees reasonably incurred by such parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.   (c) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 9.1, for a period of three (3) years after such termination,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, induce or
attempt to induce any officers, employees, representatives or agents of
Pfizer\'s Animal Health Group, or any employees of Pfizer or any of its
Affiliates which Purchaser, its representatives or agents were introduced to
in the connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
leave the employ of Pfizer or any such Affiliate, or violate the terms of
their contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Pfizer or any such
Affiliate, except that nothing in this sentence shall restrict or preclude
the rights of Purchaser and its Affiliates to make generalized searches for
employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media)
or by engaging search firms to engage in searches that are not targeted or
focused on the employees engaged in such activities.   ARTICLE X

credit is or becomes available to Purchaser, by Purchaser; and (y) in respect
of any other such Taxes and fees not falling within subsection (x) above, by
the Person having responsibility by Law, provided that if any such Tax or fee

shall be borne by the Purchaser solely. Pfizer and Purchaser, as the case may
be, will on demand reimburse the other for its share of any such Taxes and
fees paid by the other in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this

part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of
the provisions hereof.   Section 10.15 Severability. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of
any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application

TRANSITIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT, dated as of ___________ 2000
(this "Agreement"), by and between Pfizer Inc, a Delaware corporation
(together with its Affiliates, "Pfizer"), and Philipp Brothers Chemicals,
Inc., a New York corporation (together with its Affiliates, "Buyer").   W I
T N E S S E T H   WHEREAS, Pfizer and Buyer have entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2000 (the "Purchase
Agreement"), whereby Pfizer has agreed to sell (or cause the other Asset
Selling Corporations to sell), and Buyer has agreed to purchase, thc Conveyed
Assets relating to the Products (as each such term is defined in the Purchase
Agreement);   WHEREAS, Section 7.7 of the Purchase Agreement provides for
Pfizer and Buyer to enter into an agreement relating to the provision by
Pfizer of certain transitional services to Buyer; and   WHEREAS, it is the
intention of thc parties that Pfizer will provide the Services provided for
herein during the Services Period (as such terms are hereinafter defined),
subject to and on the terms and conditions herein set forth.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   Section 1.
Definitions   Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to those terms in the Purchase Agreement. The
following terms used herein have the following meanings:     "Fully
Allocated Cost" shall mean all of Pfizer\'s costs, direct and indirect, of
providing the Services, including all labor, occupancy, material expenditures
and overhead, calculated and allocated on the same basis as such costs were
charged to the Business prior to Closing as set forth on Schedule
1 hereto.   "Locations" shall mean all of the locations described on
Schedule 1 hereto.   "Services" shall mean the services listed on Schedule
1 hereto, as more fully described on Exhibit A hereto, which Schedule and
Exhibit are incorporated herein by reference as if expressly set forth
herein.   "Services Period" shall mean, with respect to a particular
Service, the period of time commencing on the date hereof and ending at the
expiration of the period of time such Service will be provided pursuant
hereto as indicated in Schedule 1 and/or Exhibit A hereto.   Section 2.
Services   (a) Pfizer agrees to provide to Buyer and/or its Affiliates
the Services at the Locations during the applicable Services Period.   (b)
Pfizer will perform, or will ensure that the Services are performed, in a
manner which is substantially similar in nature, quality and timeliness to
those provided to the Business prior to the Closing Date, except as expressly
set forth in Exhibit A hereto; provided, however, that Pfizer shall provide
or cause to be provided Services only to the extent such Services relate to
the Buyer\'s continued operation of the Business; provided, further,
that except as required by Section 5(d) hereof, Pfizer will not be required
to perform or to cause to be performed any of the Services for the benefit of
any    third party or any other entity other than Buyer or any wholly
owned subsidiary or majority owned Affiliate of Buyer. Pfizer makes no other
warranties, express or implied, with respect to the Services.   (c)
Services provided pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be charged at
prices equal to Pfizer\'s Fully Allocated Cost.   (d) Pfizer shall not be
obligated to perform or to cause to be performed any Service in a volume or
quantity which exceeds the historical volumes or quantities of Services
performed for the Business. Pfizer may, upon the written reasonable request
of Buyer, elect to provide any Services in excess of such historical volumes
or quantities; provided, however, that Pfizer will be reasonable in
exercising its election to accommodate any such reasonable request, all on
the terms and conditions set forth herein. In the event Pfizer agrees to any
such reasonable request, Buyer shall pay the Fully Allocated Cost for any
such Services, including any incremental costs attributable to such increased
level of Service. In the event of non-performance of any Service due to Force
Majeure (as hereinafter defined), the parties agree to work together in good
faith to arrange for an alternative means by which Buyer may obtain,
at Buyer\'s sole cost, the Services so affected.   (e) At Buyer\'s request,
Pfizer agrees to allow Buyer reasonable access to Pfizer\'s employees that
perform the Services (the "Services Personnel") during the term of this
Agreement, as well as the Pfizer personnel responsible for the Services
listed on Schedule 2, provided that with respect to legal services, Buyer\'s
"reasonable access" shall be limited to answering inquiries as Buyer may
request in the transfer of such services and that the access to such
personnel would not be deemed to be legal    representation of Buyer by
Pfizer (and in no event shall Pfizer be required to so undertake legal
representation), for the purpose of assisting Buyer in the operation of the
Business and transferring the Services to Buyer or to third parties
designated by Buyer. Buyer agrees to schedule such access so as to minimize
disruption to such Services Personnel\'s employment obligations to Pfizer.
Buyer will reimburse Pfizer, promptly following Pfizer\'s delivery to Buyer
of supporting documentation, for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Pfizer in connection with such assistance provided by
the Services Personnel (including, without limitation, documented reasonable
travel expenses).   (f) All existing contractual arrangements regarding the
provision of services between the Business and Pfizer or any of its
Affiliates shall terminate at Closing and shall be superseded at Closing, as
appropriate, by this Agreement and other agreements which Pfizer and Buyer
have entered into contemporaneously herewith.   Section 3. Reimbursement
and Billing   Charges for Services (i) shall be charged to and payable by
Buyer or the recipient of the Services in the local currency where such
Services are provided, (ii) shall be billed monthly, on the fifteenth day of
the month following the month in which such Services were rendered, and (iii)
shall be paid within 30 days of the date billed and following receipt of
supporting documentation. Charges not paid on or before the due date shall
bear interest from the date such payment is due until the date it is actually
received by Pfizer at an annual rate equal to twelve percent (12%) in respect
of the first thirty (30) days from such due date and thereafter at two times
the prime rate announced from time to time by Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. (or
any successor thereto).     Section 4. Term and Termination   (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Pfizer shall not be required
to provide or to cause to be provided any Services hereunder after the last
day of the [______ month] after the Closing Date.   (b) Buyer shall have the
right at any time during the term of this Agreement to terminate its
obligation to purchase any individual Service, upon the giving of not less
than 30 days advance written notice to Pfizer.   Section 5.
Miscellaneous   (a) Pfizer\'s maximum liability to, and the sole remedy of,
Buyer for breach of this Agreement shall be the greater of (i) a refund of
the price paid for the particular Service or (ii) Buyer\'s incremental cost
of performing the Service itself or (iii) Buyer\'s incremental cost of
obtaining the Service from a third party; provided, that Buyer shall exercise
all reasonable efforts under the circumstances to minimize the costs of any
such alternatives to the Services by selecting a commercially reasonable
alternative which provides the functional equivalent of the Services
replaced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall
Pfizer have any liability or loss of profit, goodwill or other special or
consequential damages as a result of provision of or failure to provide the
Services under the terms of this Agreement.   (b) Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Pfizer and its Affiliates from, against and in
respect of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by or
asserted against Pfizer or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly
relating to or arising out of any act or omission of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with their use of the Services, except to the extent
any Losses are due to the gross    negligence, willful misconduct or fraud
of Pfizer or any of its Affiliates or a failure by Pfizer to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement. To the extent Buyer may be obligated to
indemnify Pfizer pursuant to this Section 5(b), Pfizer shall take and cause
its Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss.   (c) Neither
party shall be responsible for failure or delay in performance of any
Services, nor shall either party be responsible for failure or delay in
receiving such Service, if caused by an act of God, act of public enemy, war,
government acts or regulations, fire, flood, hurricane, embargo, quarantine,
epidemic, labor stoppages beyond its reasonable control, accident, explosion,
unusually severe weather or other cause similar or dissimilar to
the foregoing beyond their control (herein called "Force Majeure").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Services are available after the
occurrence of a "Force Majeure" event, Buyer shall be entitled to, and Pfizer
shall provide, a level of Services equivalent to the proportionate share of
Services used by the Business immediately prior to the occurrence of any such
Force Majeure event.   (d) Neither party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either
party may assign its rights and obligations with respect to the provision of
Services hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary or majority owned
Affiliate, provided, that any such assignment shall terminate in the event
such wholly owned subsidiary or majority owned Affiliate ceases    to be
such; and (ii) with the prior written consent of Pfizer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), Buyer may assign its rights and obligations
with respect to the provision of Services under this Agreement to any
purchaser of all or substantially all of the Business, so long as Buyer
remains liable for all (i) representations, warranties and agreements made
herein and (ii) all increased costs attributable thereto.   (e) Any term or
provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance
may be extended, by the party entitled to the benefit thereof. The failure of
any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall
not be construed as a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the
validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party
thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach.   (f) In the event of a conflict between the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Purchase
Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement shall govern,
supersede and prevail.   (g) This Agreement shall be governed and construed
under the substantive laws of the State of New York without reference to the
conflicts of laws principles thereof, except that for purposes of determining
compliance with or the existence of liabilities under Environmental Laws, the
Environmental Laws of the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the
Real Property, Facility or activity involved shall govern. Each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County and (b) the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York for the purposes of any suit,
action    or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby.   (h) This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.   (i) Each party
recognizes that in the performance of this Agreement confidential and/or
proprietary information belonging to the other party regarding the Services
may be disclosed or become known to the other party or its respective
Affiliates ("Confidential Information"). Unless otherwise expressed in
writing to the other party, information, including that expressed orally,
that is exchanged between the parties shall be presumed to be confidential
and/or proprietary. Each party agrees to take such precautions as it normally
takes with its confidential and/or proprietary information to hold in
confidence for a period of ten (10) years after termination of this
Agreement any and all written confidential and/or proprietary information
with respect to the Services which belongs to the other party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall hold all information
regarding the other party\'s business operations or business systems in trust
and confidence for such other party and not use it or disclose it to any
person. In addition, each party shall hold all confidential and proprietary
information of other vendors with whom the other party has a contractual or
other business relationship in trust and confidence for such other party and
such vendors, shall not use or disclose such information to any person. This
obligation shall not apply to:   (A) information that, at the time of
disclosure, is in the public domain;     (B) information that, after
disclosure, is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain
through no fault of the party to whom the information was disclosed;   (C)
information that a party can show through its records was in its possession
or the possession of an Affiliate at the time of disclosure (except for
confidential information regarding the Business in Pfizer\'s possession,
which shall continue to be confidential): and   (D) information that may be
received by a party in good faith from a source other than the other party
which source either has no duty of non-disclosure to such other party or, if
such source does have a duty of non-disclosure, the receiving party was
unaware of or had no reasonable basis for knowing thereof.   (i) Each party
shall maintain, however, the right to disclose such information if required
to do so by law, but shall endeavor to keep and assist the other parties in
keeping it confidential by all appropriate means. If a party finds it
necessary to disclose any such information in any judicial or administrative
hearing or proceeding, the party shall attempt to disclose such information
"in camera" or subject to "protective order" or on some other non-public
basis.   (ii) Upon termination of this Agreement, the parties shall
return each other\'s Confidential Information, provided that the parties
shall be entitled to retain one record copy in their legal departments to
determine the extent of their continuing obligations.   (j) All notices or
other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given (i) on
the date of delivery if delivered personally, (ii) on the date
of    transmission if sent via facsimile transmission to the facsimile

promptly after completion of transmission; (iii) on the date after delivery

schedules and exhibits attached hereto, and the Purchase Agreement, including
the schedules and exhibits attached thereto, and the other agreements which
Pfizer and Buyer have entered into contemporaneously    herewith,
constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with regard
to the subject matter thereof and supersede any prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations, whether written or oral pertaining
to the subject matter hereof.   (l) This Agreement shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other
than Pfizer, Buyer, or their successors or assigns permitted by Section 5(d),
any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.   (m)
Pfizer shall provide to Buyer and its auditors and authorized representatives
such information relating to the Services and the accuracy of fees invoiced

and upon reasonable notice, to Pfizer\'s books and records relating to the
Services for purposes of verifying the Services provided and the charges
therefor.   (n) Buyer, on the one hand, and Pfizer on the other,
acknowledge that they are separate entities, each of which has entered into

and Buyer hereunder is that of one independent contractor to another and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create a joint venture,
partnership or any other relationship.   (o) Both parties are obliged to
undertake all reasonable efforts to solve in an amiable way any controversy
arising in connection with this Agreement.     (p) Notwithstanding
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall remain obligated to pay all
amounts due and payable as of the date of termination in the manner provided
by this Agreement. Section 5(a) (limitations of damages), 5(b)
(indemnification) and 5(i) (confidentiality) shall survive termination of
this Agreement.   (q) Buyer shall cause its employees to comply with all of
Pfizer\'s security requirements at the Locations. Buyer agrees that all such
employees shall be treated as "contractors" at such Locations and,
consequently, access to unrelated areas thereat will be accordingly
restricted by Pfizer.   (r) Buyer shall, if required by the terms of any
agreement governing the use of proprietary software and upon notice from
Pfizer, be responsible for obtaining and paying for any licenses in respect
of such proprietary software of a third party.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
parties have executed this Agreement to be executed as of the date first
written above.   PFIZER INC.   By:_____________________________________

ASSIGNMENT; SUBLICENSING   3.1 Licensee shall not assign, transfer,
sublicense or in any manner convey all or any part of its rights or

publicly distributed materials misuse the Licensed Intellectual Property or
misrepresent the Licensed Products in any material respect, Licensee shall,
upon notice from Licensor, immediately take steps which are necessary to
correct the deviations or misrepresentation in, or misuse
of, the   respective items; provided, however, in the event Licensor
reasonably determines that the defect poses a threat to public health or
safety, or to the validity of the Licensed Intellectual Property or to the
goodwill associated herewith, Licensee shall, upon notice from Licensor,
immediately cease and desist all distribution, sale and marketing of the
nonconforming items, and shall immediately direct its distributors and
retailers to cease shipment and sale of such nonconforming items. In
addition, Licensor shall have the right to inspect upon reasonable notice and
during normal business hours such premises of Licensee where applicable
activities relating to the packaging, sale, distribution or marketing of
Licensed Products are conducted, subject to appropriate confidentiality
restrictions reasonably requested by Licensee, in order to ensure the quality

Licensor to assure the quality of the Licensed Products bearing the Licensed
Intellectual Property.   ARTICLE VI.  USE OF LICENSED INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY   6.1 Licensee shall use the Licensed Intellectual Property
in accordance with sound trademark and trade name usage principles and
in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations as necessary to

Property. Licensee shall not use any Licensed Intellectual Property in any

therein (with the exception of those rights expressly granted to Licensee
hereunder) and the goodwill pertaining thereto belong exclusively
to Licensor. Licensee\'s use of the Licensed Intellectual Property shall
inure to the benefit of Licensor for all purposes, including trademark
registration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee
shall not challenge the validity of Licensor\'s ownership of the Licensed
Intellectual Property or any registration of application for registration
thereof or   contest the fact that Licensee\'s rights under this Agreement
are solely those of a Licensee, which rights terminate upon expiration or
termination of this Agreement.   7.2 Licensor shall be responsible for the
prosecution and maintenance of registrations of the Licensed Intellectual
Property, at Licensor\'s expense. Licensee shall cooperate with Licensor, and
shall execute any documents required by Licensor and supply Licensor with a
reasonable number of specimens to assist Licensor, in the registration,
enforcement, or maintenance of any Licensed Intellectual Property or recordal
of Licensee as a registered user or Licensee.   7.3 Licensee agrees not to
register, or attempt to register, the Licensed Intellectual Property or any
confusingly similar intellectual property in its own name or any other name,

termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VIII  PROTECTION OF THE LICENSED
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   8.1 In the event that Licensee learns of any
infringement or unauthorized use of the Licensed Intellectual Property in
connection with the Licensed Products or similar products, it shall promptly
notify Licensor. Licensor shall have the sole initial right to bring

order to protect the Licensed Intellectual Property. If requested to do so,
Licensee shall reasonably cooperate with Licensor in any such action,
including but not limited to joining the action as a party if necessary to
maintain standing, at Licensor\'s expense. Any award, or portion of an award,
recovered by Licensor in any such action or proceeding commenced by Licensor
shall belong solely to Licensor after recovery by both parties of their
respective, actual out-of-pocket costs.   8.2 If Licensor determines not to
take any such action, then Licensee may take such action in its own name at
its own expense; provided that it first obtains the consent of Licensor and
keeps Licensor informed of the status of, and its respective activities
regarding such action and any settlement or other resolutions thereof.
Licensor may cooperate with Licensee or join such action at its sole
discretion, at Licensee\'s expense. Any award recovered by Licensee in any
action or proceeding commenced by Licensee as permitted herein shall belong
solely to Licensee, after recovery by both parties of their respective,
actual out-of-pocket costs.   8.3 Licensor shall indemnify, defend and hold
Licensee harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and
associated legal expenses arising out of any allegation that the Licensed
Intellectual Property infringes the rights of any third party. In the event
of the institution of any infringement action by a third party against
Licensee for use of the Licensed Intellectual Property in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor of such
action in writing.   Licensor shall have the obligation to join and control
the defense of such action at Licensor\'s expense, and Licensee shall
cooperate in such defense as requested by Licensor, at Licensee\'s expense.
All judgments and settlements resulting from such action shall be paid by the
Licensor and any award received by Licensor or Licensee in such an action
shall belong solely to Licensor.   8.4 Licensee shall keep Licensor informed
of the status of, and its activities regarding, any litigation, and
settlement or other resolution thereof, concerning the Licensed Intellectual

entered into without the written consent of Licensor.   ARTICLE IX. 
INDEMNIFICATION   9.1 Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor
harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and associated
legal expenses arising out of Licensee\'s use of the Licensed Intellectual

packaging under such Licensed Intellectual Property, other than claims,
losses, damages and associated legal expenses for which the Licensor is
responsible or is obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensee
pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof, the provisions of the Pfizer Supply and
Tolling Agreement, or the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement.   9.2

(PURCHASER TO PFIZER), dated as of this ___ day of _________, 2000, is by and
between Philipp Brothers Chemicals, Inc., a New York corporation (referred to
herein, together with its Affiliates, as "Licensor") and Pfizer Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Pfizer") a Delaware corporation (referred to herein,
together with its Affiliates, as "Licensee").   RECITALS   WHEREAS,
Licensor and Licensee have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as
of September 28, 2000 (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which Licensee
is selling certain assets (as described in Purchase Agreement) to Licensor,
including, without limitation, the Licensed Trademarks;   WHEREAS, Licensee
has heretofore used the Licensed Trademarks in connection with certain non-
feed additive products which are not being sold pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement but which are marketed under the Licensed Trademarks (the
"Products");   WHEREAS, Section 7.8(c) of the Purchase Agreement provides
that Licensor and Licensee shall enter into a Trademark License Agreement in
order to permit Licensee to continue to use the Licensed Trademarks in
connection with the sale of the Products.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings contained herein, and
subject to and on the terms and conditions herein set forth, the parties
hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.  DEFINITIONS   Capitalized terms
used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set
forth for such terms in the Purchase Agreement. The following terms used
herein have the following meanings:   "Agreement" shall mean this Trademark
License Agreement, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to
time in accordance with the terms hereof.   "Closing" shall mean the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.  
"Licensed Trademarks" shall mean those unregistered or registered trademarks
listed on Schedule A hereto.   ARTICLE II.  GRANT OF LICENSE: BEST
EFFORTS   2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free right and
license to use the Licensed Trademarks in connection with the packaging,
sale, marketing, and distribution of the Products in all countries of the
world.    2.2 Licensee shall not use any Licensed Trademarks in
connection with any articles of any description other than Products.   2.3
In the event there are omissions or errors in Schedule A hereto, including,
but not limited to the listing of Licensed Trademarks or the omission of any
trademark or trade name falling within the definition of a
Licensed Trademark, the parties shall modify Schedule A with correct
information.   ARTICLE III.  ASSIGNMENT; SUBLICENSING   3.1 Licensee
shall not assign, transfer, sublicense or in any manner convey all or any
part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any other party,
without the prior written consent of Licensor.   ARTICLE IV.  TERM OF
AGREEMENT   4.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date
hereof and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall continue for a
period of fifty (50) years.   ARTICLE V.  QUALITY CONTROL   5.1 Licensor
shall have the right to exercise quality control over the Products and
Licensee\'s use of the Licensed Trademarks to a degree necessary to maintain
the validity of the Licensed Trademarks and to protect the
goodwill associated therewith. Licensor acknowledges that the quality of the
Products sold by Licensee prior to the Closing is adequate for this purpose.
Accordingly, Licensee shall, in its sale, marketing and distribution of the
Products, adhere to a level of quality at least as high as that maintained by
it for the sale, marketing and distribution of the Products prior to the
Closing.   5.2 Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws and
regulations in the sale, distribution and marketing of the Products, and
Licensee shall use all legends, notices, and markings as required by law.  
5.3 Licensee shall, upon reasonable request by Licensor, submit to Licensor
samples of products and product packaging and representative samples of all
publicly distributed materials bearing the Licensed Trademarks which are then
currently sold or distributed by Licensee. In the event that Licensor
finds that such samples of products or product packaging materially deviate
from the Products or product packaging as sold or distributed by Licensee
prior to the Closing or that such promotional or publicly distributed
materials misuse the Licensed Trademarks or misrepresent the Products in any
material respect, Licensee shall, upon notice from Licensor, immediately take
steps which are necessary to correct the deviations or misrepresentation in,
or misuse of, the respective items; provided, however, in the event Licensor
reasonably determines that the defect poses a threat to public health or
safety, or to the validity of the Licensed Trademark or to the goodwill
associated herewith, Licensee shall, upon notice from Licensor, immediately
cease and desist all distribution, sale and marketing of the nonconforming
items, and shall immediately direct its distributors and retailers to cease
shipment and sale of such nonconforming items. In addition, Licensor shall
have the right to inspect upon reasonable notice and during normal business
hours such premises of Licensee where applicable activities relating to the
packaging, sale, distribution or marketing of Products are conducted, subject
to appropriate confidentiality restrictions reasonably requested by Licensee,
in order to ensure the quality of the Products bearing the Licensed
Trademarks.   5.4 Licensee shall otherwise endeavor to comply with such
other reasonable requests as are made by Licensor to enable Licensor to
assure the quality of the Products bearing the Licensed Trademarks.   
ARTICLE VI.  USE OF LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   6.1 Licensee shall use
the Licensed Trademarks in accordance with sound trademark and trade name
usage principles and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations
as necessary to maintain the validity and enforceability of the Licensed
Trademarks. Licensee shall not use any Licensed Trademarks in any manner
which might tarnish, disparage, or reflect adversely on Licensor or the
Licensed Trademarks.   6.2 Licensee shall not materially alter the
appearance of the Licensed Trademarks on Products, or in any advertising,
marketing, distribution, or sales materials, or any other publicly
distributed materials, from the appearance of the Licensed Trademarks used by
Licensee in connection with the Products prior to the Closing.   6.3
Licensee acknowledges that its rights to use the Licensed Trademarks are
nonexclusive. Licensee agrees that it shall cooperate to avoid confusion or
conflict arising out of Licensor\'s simultaneous use of the
Licensed Trademarks, and to resolve any such conflicts to the satisfaction of
Licensor.   ARTICLE VII.  PROPERTY OF LICENSOR   7.1 Licensee
acknowledges that the Licensed Trademarks and all rights therein (with the
exception of those rights expressly granted to Licensee hereunder) and the
goodwill pertaining thereto belong exclusively to Licensor. Licensee\'s use
of the Licensed Trademarks shall inure to the benefit of Licensor for all
purposes, including trademark registration. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Licensee shall not challenge the validity of Licensor\'s
ownership of the Licensed Trademarks or any registration of application for
registration thereof or contest the fact that Licensee\'s rights under this
Agreement are solely those of a Licensee, which rights terminate
upon expiration or termination of this Agreement.   7.2 Licensor shall be
responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of registrations of the
Licensed Trademarks, at Licensor\'s expense. Licensee shall cooperate with
Licensor, and shall execute any documents required by Licensor and supply
Licensor with a reasonable number of specimens to assist Licensor, in the
registration, enforcement, or maintenance of any Licensed Trademarks or
recordal of Licensee as a registered user or licensee.   7.3 Licensee agrees
not to register, or attempt to register, the Licensed Trademarks or any
confusingly similar intellectual property in its own name or any other name,
or to use the Licensed Trademarks in commerce other than as provided
herein.   7.4 The provisions of this Article 7 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VIII  PROTECTION OF THE LICENSED
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   8.1 In the event that Licensee learns of any
infringement or unauthorized use of the Licensed Trademarks in connection
with the Products or similar products, it shall promptly notify Licensor.
Licensor shall have the sole initial right to bring infringement actions or
other similar proceedings against third parties in order to protect the
Licensed Trademarks. If requested to do so, Licensee shall reasonably
cooperate with Licensor in any such action, including but not limited to
joining the action as a party if necessary to maintain standing, at
Licensor\'s expense. Any award, or portion of an award, recovered by Licensor
in any such action or proceeding commenced by Licensor shall belong solely to
Licensor after recovery by both parties of their respective, actual out-of-
pocket costs.    8.2 If Licensor determines not to take any such action,
then Licensee may take such action in its own name at its own expense;
provided that it first obtains the consent of Licensor and keeps Licensor
informed of the status of, and its respective activities regarding such
action and any settlement or other resolutions thereof. Licensor may
cooperate with Licensee or join such action at its sole discretion, at
Licensee\'s expense. Any award recovered by Licensee in any action or
proceeding commenced by Licensee as permitted herein shall belong solely to
Licensee, after recovery by both parties of their respective, actual out-of-
pocket costs.   8.3 Licensor shall indemnify, defend and hold Licensee
harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and associated
legal expenses arising out of any allegation that any Licensed Trademark
infringes the rights of any third party. In the event of the institution of
any infringement action by a third party against Licensee for use of the
Licensed Trademarks in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor of such action in writing. Licensor
shall have the obligation to join and control the defense of such action at
Licensor\'s expense, and Licensee shall cooperate in such defense as
requested by Licensor, at Licensee\'s expense. All judgments and settlements
resulting from such action shall be paid by the Licensor and any award
received by Licensor or Licensee in such an action shall belong solely to
Licensor.   8.4 Licensee shall keep Licensor informed of the status of, and
its activities regarding, any litigation, and settlement or other
resolution thereof, concerning the Licensed Trademarks. No settlement or
consent judgment or other voluntary final disposition of any action defended
or action brought by Licensee may be entered into without the written consent
of Licensor.   ARTICLE IX.  INDEMNIFICATION   9.1 Licensee shall
indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor, its Affiliates and their respective
officers, and directors harmless from and against any and all claims, losses,
damages and associated legal expenses arising out of Licensee\'s use of the
Licensed Trademarks or the manufacture, use, and sale of products or any
product packaging under such Licensed Trademarks other than claims, losses,
damages and associated legal expenses for which the Licensor is responsible
or is obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensee pursuant to
Section 8.3 hereof, the provisions of the Pfizer Supply and Tolling Agreement
or the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.   9.2 The provisions of this
Article IX shall survive the termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE X. 
TERMINATION   10.1 In the event that either party commits a material breach
of this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall notify the breaching party
of the breach in writing. If the breaching party fails to cure the breach
within thirty (30) days from its receipt of such notice, or such lesser
period set forth herein (the "Cure Period"), the non-breaching party may,
upon written notice effective upon receipt, terminate this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if the breaching party is unable to
cure its breach within the Cure Period for reasons of Force Majeure, notice
shall be given in compliance with Article XIV herein.   ARTICLE XI.

after the expiration or termination of this Agreement:   (a) all rights
granted to Licensee hereunder shall revert to Licensor;    (b) Licensee
shall cease all use of the Licensed Trademarks or of any trademark, trade
name or trade dress confusingly similar thereto, and Licensee shall remove
all uses of the Licensed Trademarks from the applicable Products and destroy
all remaining applicable product packaging, signage, stationery, or other
materials bearing the Licensed Trademarks; and   (c) Licensee shall not make
reference in its consumer or trade advertising to having been formerly

used but not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings assigned to them
in the Asset Purchase Agreement.  SECTION 2 - SALES TO PHIBRO  2.1 During
the Term of this Agreement, Pfizer agrees to sell to or toll  for Phibro such
quantities of Products as Phibro may from time to  time order pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.2 hereof. All  deliveries shall be made to such
locations designated by Phibro to  Pfizer from time to time in writing;
provided, however, that Pfizer  will not ship Products from its manufacturing
locations to Phibro\'s  customers, except as provided in the terms of the
Transitional  Services Agreement between the Parties executed pursuant to
the  terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.  2.2 During the Term of this
Agreement, Phibro shall purchase from Pfizer  and Pfizer shall supply Phibro
according to the following  provisions:   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   (a) [  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ] 
[ * ]  [ * ]   (b) [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ] 
[ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ *
]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]   (c) On the 91st day after the date hereof,
Phibro will provide to  Pfizer its forecast of its requirements for all
Products and Product  Lines by quarter for the remainder of the Term, with
the first  period of that forecast being at least 3 months and ending with
the  end of the next succeeding calendar quarter. The forecasts also will 
indicate whether Pfizer or Phibro will supply the Bulk Active for  each
ordered Product as well as the manufacturing site for each  Product. At that
time, Phibro will give to Pfizer purchase and  tolling orders that reflect
the forecast for the first period noted  above in the first sentence of this
subparagraph (c).   (d) Following the delivery of the forecast described in
subparagraph  (c) above, Phibro will deliver to Pfizer, on the first business
day  of each succeeding calendar quarter, an updated quarterly forecast  and
issue    purchase and tolling orders for one additional calendar quarter 
beyond those orders already given to Pfizer until forecasts and  purchase and
tolling orders have been given for all quarters  remaining in the Term. Six
months prior to the expiration of the  original Term, Phibro will issue firm
purchase and tolling orders  for the remainder of the Term or, for those
sites where the Standard  Term is in effect, Phibro will inform Pfizer of its
intention to  extend the Term for an additional 3 months, in which case it
will  issue firm purchase and tolling orders for the next calendar quarter 
and will, six months prior to the expiration of the extended Term,  issue
firm purchase and tolling orders for the remainder of the  extended Term. All
purchase orders hereunder shall not exceed  forecast quantities by more than
25% without Pfizer\'s prior  approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   (e) Phibro\'s annual and quarterly forecasts and
the aggregate of all  purchase and tolling orders must be within Pfizer\'s
capacity as  specified in Appendix B. [Note: Facility capacity numbers for
each  site must be included in Appendix B.]   (f) Pfizer is obligated to
maintain its capacity for any given  Product or Product Line until the
earlier of (x) the time that  Phibro terminates Pfizer\'s manufacture of such
Product Line in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (y) the end of
the  Term, or (z) at each manufacturing site at which Product is to be 
manufactured pursuant to this Agreement, until Pfizer has completed  the
manufacture of sufficient Product to satisfy the final purchase  and tolling
orders provided to Pfizer hereunder. Once Pfizer\'s  obligation to maintain
its capacity for any given Product has been  terminated, Pfizer shall not be
obligated to resume manufacture of  such Product.   (g) Pfizer will produce
the products following the same practices  and procedures in effect as of the
Closing. Pfizer has absolute and  exclusive control of its manufacture and
tolling, as the case may  be, of the Products. Phibro\'s specification of
manufacturing site  and quantities for all forecasts and purchase orders made
pursuant  to this Section 2.2 must be consistent with Pfizer\'s
capabilities  and production experience at, and regulatory approvals obtained
for  the designated site for each Product as of the date of this  Agreement.
Either Pfizer or Phibro may elect to change the  manufacturing site of one or
more Products to another Pfizer site,  provided that the site to which
manufacturing activities are to be  moved has the requisite capacity,
expertise and regulatory approvals  necessary to manufacture and supply the
particular Product in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The party
wishing to  initiate such a move will notify the other in writing of its
desire  and, subject to the foregoing conditions, the move will become 
effective at the earliest practicable time as determined by Pfizer.  Any
increased shipping costs or increases in   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   [ * ] that result from such a move
initiated by Pfizer will be  borne by Pfizer. If a move is initiated by
Phibro, then Phibro will  be responsible for any increases in the costs for
which it has  responsibility under the terms of this Agreement. Similarly, it
will  benefit from any decreases in costs for which it has responsibility 
hereunder.  2.3 All Products to be supplied by Pfizer hereunder are
guaranteed as of  the date of each shipment to Phibro to be in compliance in
all  material respects with the product specifications and quality  control
standards set forth in Appendix C. Within thirty (30) days  of receipt of
Products by Phibro under this Agreement, Phibro shall  have the right to test
and inspect Products and reject Products  which do not conform to such
specifications and quality control  standards. In the event of such
rejection, Phibro shall notify  Pfizer within 72 hours of such rejection, and
Pfizer shall, at  Pfizer\'s option, within 30 days from its receipt of
Phibro\'s  rejection notice and accompanying rationale as to why such
Products  failed to meet such specifications and quality control standards, 
either commit to replace rejected Products as promptly as  practicable or
notify Phibro that Pfizer disputes that the subject  Products failed to meet
such specifications and quality control  standards, in which case the parties
shall submit samples of such  disputed batches of Products and accompanying
documentation to a  mutually acceptable independent laboratory for testing.
The losing  party shall bear the cost and expenses of the related
laboratory  tests. If Pfizer chooses to replace nonconforming Product for
which  Phibro has supplied the Bulk Active, Pfizer shall pay Phibro the 
actual cost of the Bulk Active that was consumed by Pfizer in the 
manufacture of the nonconforming Product, unless such Bulk Active  was,
itself, nonconforming, in which case Phibro shall be obligated  to pay Pfizer
for the nonconforming Product as though such Product  was conforming. Phibro
shall have no remedy in respect of any such  noncompliance except as
described in this Section 2.3.  2.4 [ * ]  [ * ]All Taxes,  if any,
payable to any jurisdiction by reason of any sales and  purchases of Product
hereunder shall be paid or provided for by  Phibro and Pfizer shall be
entitled to reimbursement from Phibro for  any Taxes for which it has
responsibility to a Governmental  Authority as a result of its activities
hereunder, other than Taxes  measured by the income to Pfizer resulting from
its activities  hereunder.  2.5 Products will be manufactured or tolled in
the locations indicated  in Appendix B. [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ] Phibro
shall bear the cost of  shipping and   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST
FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   insurance. Title and risk of loss for the
Products for which Pfizer  supplies the Bulk Active shall pass to Phibro at
the point of  shipment. Title and risk of loss for the Products for which
Phibro  supplies the Bulk Active shall remain with Phibro at all
times.  2.6 The invoice for all sales of Products will be issued on the date
of  shipment in the local currency of the manufacturing site. Terms of 
payment shall be net sixty (60) days after the date of shipment in 
accordance with the purchase orders. Such invoices shall include  Pfizer\'s
cost of transportation. Payment shall be made by Phibro by  check delivered
to Pfizer\'s address as designated in such invoices  or by wire transfer to
an account designated by Pfizer. Any required  payment hereunder not made by
Phibro on or before the date specified  in this Section 2.6 shall bear
interest from the date such payment  is due until the date it is actually
received by Pfizer at an annual  rate equal to twelve percent (12%).  2.7
Phibro will promptly notify Pfizer of any changes to the  specifications in
Appendix B that are required by changes in Laws or  are otherwise desired by
Phibro, including changes to the packaging  of the Products. Any such changes
will be subject to the prior  approval of Pfizer, and Pfizer will use
reasonable business efforts  to accommodate such changes.[ * ]  [ * ]  [ *
]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  2.8 Pfizer will provide Phibro with copies of
certificates of analysis  and will maintain, at the respective manufacturing
sites,  manufacturing records for each Product it is then manufacturing for 
Phibro under this Agreement for inspection by Phibro. These  manufacturing
records shall include: (a) copies of all analytical  results for the
Products; (b) copies of analytical results for raw  materials used; (c)
copies of change control documentation,  including supporting information
describing the nonstandard  production operation and the rationale and (d)
any such other  information as Phibro may reasonably request from time to
time.  2.9 (a) Pfizer will provide reasonable technical support to Phibro
to  assist in the transition of production of the Product Lines to 
alternative sources of supply as designated by Phibro. This  technical
support will consist of: i) direct  production/manufacturing support, which
will include training of  Phibro employees in the manufacture of the
Products; ii)  process/facility design support, which will include assistance
in  the development of overall process designs, material and energy 
balances, the development of equipment specifications, capital cost 
estimates related to Phibro\'s designs and the evaluation of Phibro\'s 
detailed designs prior to their   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   implementation; and iii) support in the technology
transfer of  analytical/QC/QA policies and procedures. Pfizer does not
warrant  the quality of the services to be provided under this Section
2.9.   (b) [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [
* ]  [ * ]  [ * ]   (c) Phibro will reimburse Pfizer for the reasonable
travel, lodging  and meal expenses of the persons providing the services
described in  this Section 2.9. Phibro shall assume liability for any
personal  injuries sustained by Pfizer personnel in the course of providing 
these services.   (d) Pfizer\'s obligations to provide the services
described in this  Section 2.9 will terminate and be of no further force or
effect if  and to the extent Phibro or its Affiliates hire Pfizer personnel 
providing the technical support to Phibro hereunder. Pfizer will use  its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient technical  support
personnel to provide the services described in this Section  2.9. Support
beyond the levels described in this Section 2.9 is in  Pfizer\'s sole
discretion and will be reimbursed to Pfizer on a per  diem, plus expenses,
basis.   (e) Within 90 days after Closing, Phibro will provide to Pfizer a 
forecast of the technical support needs in each of clauses i), ii)  and iii)
of subparagraph (a) above for the next calendar quarter and  for the
remainder of the Term. Such forecasts shall be updated each  calendar
quarter, and will be provided to Pfizer together with the  forecasts and
purchase and tolling orders referenced above.  2.10 Pfizer will permit
Phibro and its customers (subject to each such  customer\'s execution of an
agreement to maintain any information  made available in connection therewith
as confidential in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement) to have
access during normal  business hours to Pfizer\'s manufacturing facilities
upon reasonable  notice at any time during the manufacture of the Products
for audits  and/or technical training. Such visits will be arranged to be 
mutually convenient and involve minimum interruption to Pfizer\'s 
operations.   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL
TREATMENT  2.11 Phibro will be responsible for handling any customer and
regulatory  complaints or inquiries with respect to the Products. Phibro
will  promptly notify Pfizer of any customer or regulatory complaint or 
inquiry Phibro receives with respect to the Products. Pfizer will  promptly
notify Phibro of any customer or regulatory complaint or  inquiry Pfizer
receives and will reasonably cooperate with Phibro in  connection with the
handling of all customer or regulatory  complaints or inquiries. Should
Phibro fail to adequately respond to  a customer or regulatory complaint and
Pfizer determines that it is  in Pfizer\'s interest to respond to said
complaint, Pfizer shall  respond and the reasonable cost of Pfizer\'s
response shall be billed  to Phibro.  2.12 [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]

tolling order made hereunder, in  reliance on which Pfizer has begun or
completed manufacture or  preparation of such order, Phibro shall reimburse
Pfizer for all of  the costs incurred by Pfizer in the manufacture or
preparation  thereof, including but not limited to the cost of labor, raw 
materials, energy and packaging thereof.  2.14 Pfizer will continue to use
Pfizer labeling on the Products  manufactured for Phibro hereunder until
inventories of labels and  pre-printed Product packaging have been consumed.
Phibro will  provide Pfizer with its label copy as soon as practicable from
the  date Phibro completes the related registration process, but in no 
event later than ninety (90) days thereafter, and Pfizer will  procure new
labeling and pre-printed packaging and will transition  to this Phibro
labeling once inventories of Pfizer labeling have  been depleted. Should
Phibro wish to substitute its label copy for  any Product prior to the
depletion of the inventories of Pfizer  labeling or pre-printed Product
packaging acquired to meet Phibro\'s  requirements, then Phibro shall
reimburse Pfizer for the value of  the unused labeling and/or pre-printed
packaging at Pfizer\'s full  cost.  2.15 Pfizer will provide Phibro with a
monthly report, by manufacturing  site, for each Product Line it is then
producing for Phibro under  the terms of   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR
REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   this Agreement. The monthly report will
include production data for  the prior month, including the actual quantities
of Products  produced during the month and year to date ("YTD"), the
Product  yield for the month and YTD, copies of Pfizer\'s product cost 
statements for the Product Lines, if such product cost statements  exist, a
brief narrative on significant process or maintenance  issues encountered
during the month, and any information regarding  production issues
anticipated in the succeeding months, including,  but not limited to,
shutdowns or planned maintenance activities.  This report will also record
Phibro\'s use of the technical support  that Pfizer had provided to Phibro as
provided in Section 2.9  hereof.  SECTION 3 - TERM AND TERMINATION  3.1
Pfizer will manufacture any Product Line for Phibro for a period not  to
exceed the Term. Phibro may terminate Pfizer\'s supply of any  Product
hereunder upon three (3) month\'s advance written notice, or  as otherwise
agreed to by the Parties. Upon the presentation by  Phibro of written notice
to terminate Pfizer\'s supply of any  Product, Phibro will also present a
final purchase order for the  additional quantity of said Product beyond that
already ordered, to  be produced prior to the termination of supply by
Pfizer, subject to  Pfizer\'s capacity limitations as set forth in Appendix
B. Once  Pfizer\'s obligation to manufacture a Product is terminated,
Pfizer  will not be required to and will not maintain manufacturing
capacity  or capability for that Product and it shall be relieved of the 
obligation to further provide such Product hereunder.  3.2 Upon termination
of Pfizer\'s manufacturing of any Product, Phibro  will purchase all
merchantable inventory, including finished goods,  work in process, raw
materials, packaging materials and labeling;  provided, however, that Phibro
shall not be required to purchase any  finished goods inventory to the extent
it exceeds the quantity  authorized by Phibro\'s purchase orders delivered
under Sections 2  and 3 of this Agreement.[ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ *

the  default has not been corrected within 60 days after written notice  has
been given to the defaulting Party by the non-defaulting Party,  then the
non-defaulting Party shall have the right to terminate this  Agreement by
giving written notice of termination to the defaulting  Party.  SECTION 4 -
CONFIDENTIALITY AND TECHNOLOGY OWNERSHIP  4.1 Any cost information, process
improvements and/or technical  innovations, whether patents or know-how, to
the extent related  primarily to the Product Lines, which are developed
during the Term  and result solely from the services provided under the terms
of this  Agreement (and not in any way resulting from any other part of 
Pfizer\'s operations), will be the property of Phibro; subject,  however, to
a non-exclusive, non-cancelable, non-transferable,  world-wide, royalty-free
license which Phibro hereby grants to  Pfizer to use such improvements and
innovations to and for the  benefit of Pfizer to use such items in any
business other than the  Business. Any process improvements and/or technical
innovations,  whether patents or know-how, that do not relate primarily to
the  Product Lines, which are developed during the Term and which result 
solely from the services provided under the terms of this Agreement  will be
the property of Pfizer; subject, however, to a  non-exclusive, non-
cancelable, non-transferable, world-wide  royalty-free license which Pfizer
hereby grants to Phibro to use  such improvements and innovations to and for
the benefit of Phibro.  Any process improvements and/or technical
innovations, whether  patents or know-how, arising hereunder or otherwise
developed by  Pfizer not described under the preceding two sentences shall
as  between Phibro and Pfizer, be the sole and exclusive property of 
Pfizer.  4.2 Each Party recognizes that in the performance of this Agreement
or  as a result of the Parties\' ongoing relationships, confidential  and/or
proprietary information belonging to the other Party  regarding the services
provided under the terms of this Agreement or  any other information about
the other Party may be disclosed or  become known to the other Party or its
respective Affiliates  ("Confidential Information"). Unless otherwise
expressed in writing  to the other Party, any oral, visual or written
information that is  exchanged between the Parties shall be presumed to be
Confidential  Information. Each Party agrees to take the necessary
precautions to  assure that the other Party\'s Confidential Information
remains  confidential and to hold in confidence after termination of this 
Agreement any and all oral, visual or written confidential and/or 
proprietary information with respect to such services or any other 
information about the other Party which belongs to the other Party. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this obligation shall not apply to:   (i)
information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public  domain;   
(ii) information that, after disclosure, is published or otherwise  becomes
part of the public domain through no fault of the  Party to whom the
information was disclosed;   (iii) information that a Party can show through
its records was in  its possession or the possession of an Affiliate at the
time  of disclosure (except for Confidential Information regarding  the
Business in Pfizer\'s possession, which shall continue to  be confidential);
and   (iv) information that may be received by a Party in good faith from 
a source other than the other Party, which source either has  no duty of
nondisclosure to such other Party or, if such  source does have a duty of
non-disclosure, the receiving Party  was unaware of or had no reasonable
basis for knowing thereof.   Each Party shall maintain the right to disclose
Confidential  Information if required to do so by Law, but shall endeavor to
keep  and assist the other Party in keeping it confidential by all 
appropriate means, and shall afford the other Party the opportunity  to
contest the disclosure obligation. If a Party finds it necessary  to disclose
any such information in any judicial or administrative  hearing or
proceeding, the Party shall attempt to disclose such  information "in camera"
or subject to "protective order" or on some  other non-public basis.   The
provisions of this Section 4.2 shall survive the termination of  this
Agreement and as to any particular piece of Confidential  Information, shall
continue for a period of five (5) years from such  termination or until such
information becomes public knowledge  through no fault of either Party,
whichever occurs first. Upon  termination of this Agreement for any reason
whatsoever, each Party  will make no further use or disclosure of such
Confidential  Information and upon written request, such Party further will 
immediately deliver to the other Party all such Confidential  Information as
shall be in written or other tangible form (including  all copies thereof);
provided, that one copy of any document may be  kept by the legal department
of each Party solely to ascertain its  obligations.  4.3 If either Party
shall make any unauthorized use or disclosure of  Confidential Information of
the other Party and such use or  disclosure is not remedied within a period
of 60 days after written  notice thereof shall have been given to the
defaulting Party by the  other Party hereto, then in any such case such other
Party shall  have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice  of such termination to the defaulting Party and upon the giving of 
such notice this Agreement shall immediately terminate.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such unauthorized use or  disclosure of the Confidential
Information is not capable of being   * OMITTED PURSUANT TO OUR REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT   remedied, the non-defaulting Party shall have the
right to  immediately terminate this Agreement without notice or
liability.  4.4 [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]  [ *

MAJEURE  5.1 Neither Party shall be responsible to the other for any failure
or  delay in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement or  for
other non-performance hereof if such delay or non-performance is  caused by
strike, stoppage of labor, lockout or other labor trouble,  fire, flood,
accident, act of God or of any Government Authority or  by any cause
unavoidable or beyond the reasonable control of either  Party (or any
customer or supplier thereof); provided, however, that  except as provided
for in Section 5.2 below, the Party affected  shall exert its reasonable
commercial efforts to eliminate or cure  or overcome any of such causes and
to resume performance of its  covenants with all possible speed.  5.2 In
the event of any force majeure event which substantially  incapacitates a
Pfizer Manufacturing Facility (as defined below) and  such substantial
incapacity may not be eliminated or overcome  without material cost to Pfizer
and in a period of time not  exceeding 25% of the remainder of the Term of
this Agreement  following such event, then in such event Pfizer shall have
no  obligation to repair such damage or eliminate or overcome such  causes
and may terminate its obligation to supply any affected  Products. For
purposes of this Section 5.2, Manufacturing Facility  shall mean each and
every building or facility owned or leased by  Pfizer and used for the
manufacture or storage of Products or  Product Lines.  SECTION 6 -
LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES AND DAMAGES   Pfizer\'s warranties in connection
with the Products manufactured and  delivered hereunder are limited solely to
those expressed in Section  2.3 hereof, and Pfizer shall have no further
obligation or liability  with respect to the Products. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR  A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF 
TRADE, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.    Pfizer\'s representations and warranties
in connection with the  Products set forth in Section 2.3 shall not apply to
any Product  manufactured by Pfizer and delivered to Phibro in accordance
with  this Agreement (i) for which Phibro has supplied Bulk Active that is 
found to be non-conforming with the agreed-upon specification or  (ii) which
is subsequently altered outside of Pfizer\'s facilities,  without Pfizer\'s
supervision and approval or (iii) which is  improperly used by Phibro or any
third party.   IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY
FOR ANY  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES CAUSED BY OR ARISING 
OUT OF ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.  SECTION 7 - MISCELLANEOUS  7.1 This
Agreement shall not be assignable either in whole or in part by  either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party,  except that either
Party may assign this Agreement in whole or in  part to any wholly owned
subsidiary or majority owned Affiliate (the  assignee agreeing to be bound by
all the provisions in this  Agreement), but any such assignment shall not
relieve the assigning  Party of its obligations under this Agreement. Any
such assignment  shall be valid only as long as such subsidiary or Affiliate
remains  wholly owned or majority owned by such Party, as the case may
be.  7.2 This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the
benefit  of and be enforceable by, the Parties hereto and their respective 
successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is for the sole  benefit of
the Parties hereto and nothing in this Agreement,  expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer  upon any Person (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement), other  than the Parties and successors and assigns
permitted by Section  7.1, any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this  Agreement.  7.3 All notices and other communications hereunder shall

effective unless executed in writing  and signed on behalf of each
Party.  7.6 Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the
time  for its performance may be extended, by the Party or Parties  entitled
to the    benefit thereof. The failure of any Party hereto to enforce at
any  time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a 
waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of  this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any Party  thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of  any breach of this Agreement
shall be held to constitute a waiver of  any other or subsequent
breach.  7.7 This Agreement shall be governed and construed under the
substantive  laws of the State of New York, without reference to conflicts
of  Laws principles, except that for purposes of determining compliance 
with or the existence of Liabilities under Environmental Laws, the 
Environmental Laws of the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction  over the
Real Property, personal property, Facility or activity  involved shall
govern. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the  exclusive jurisdiction
of (a) the Supreme Court of the State of New  York, New York County and (b)
the United States District Court for  the Southern District of New York for
the purposes of any suit,  action or other proceeding arising out of this

amicable way any controversy arising in  connection with this
Agreement.  7.9 Notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, Phibro shall
remain  obligated to pay all amounts due and payable as of the date of 
termination in the manner provided by this Agreement. Sections 4 
(Confidentiality) and 6 (Limitation of Warranties and Damages) shall  also
survive termination of this Agreement.  7.10 Neither Party is now, nor shall
it be made by this Agreement, an  agent or legal representative of the other

kind on its behalf.  7.11 To the extent that any purchase orders, invoices,
sales receipts,  shipping documents, forms, billing documents or other
similar  documents issued in connection with the manufacture and delivery
of  Products by Pfizer contain terms or conditions which are in conflict 
with, or derogate from this Agreement, they shall be null and void  and the
terms of this Agreement shall control.  7.12 In the event of a conflict
between the terms and conditions of this  Agreement and the terms and
conditions of the Asset Purchase  Agreement, the terms and conditions of the
Asset Purchase Agreement  shall control.   7.13 This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each  of which will be deemed an
original but all of which shall  constitute one and the same
instrument.  7.14 Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in  such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Laws (as  defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) but in case any one or
more  of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to 
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such  invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any  other provisions of this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall be  construed as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or  provisions had never been contained herein

material change  as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby to be  unreasonable.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Pfizer and Phibro have
caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective duly authorized
officers.   By:_____________________________

Services that will enable the Parties to each operate their respective
businesses in harmony with each other and the length of time that the
Services are to be provided, it being the express intent of the Parties that
both businesses will ultimately be separate and independent operational
businesses with only such interdependent services (if any) as the Parties
will expressly agree in the future.   If either of the Parties is of the
opinion that Support and Administrative Services in addition to or in excess
of the quantities then provided for in this Agreement are required from the
other Party, or that an extension of the Term during which such Services are
to be provided is required, then such Party will so notify in writing the
other Party of the need and the reasonable basis on which said additional
services should be provided or such Term extension should be granted. The
Party receiving said notice may approve and grant or deny such request in its
discretion, and will provide such approval or denial in writing. If such a
request is made and approved, then the Parties will enter into a supplement
or amendment to this Agreement and the defined terms "Services" and "Term"
shall be deemed to be supplemented or amended in the manner provided for in
such supplement or amendment.  4. CHARGES AND PAYMENTS   Each Party will
send the other Party an invoice specifying charges for the Services provided
pursuant to this Agreement. Such invoices will be furnished on a monthly
basis, no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which
such Services were rendered, and charges will be payable in Brazil

FGV index.   3   5. SERVICE LEVEL   All Services will be performed in a
manner which is substantially similar in nature, quality, quantity and
timeliness to those provided at the Guarulhos Property prior to the Closing
under the Asset Purchase Agreement, unless otherwise stated in the Appendices
to this Agreement or agreed to in writing by the Parties.  6. FORECAST;
UTILITIES CONSUMPTION   During the Term, each Party will provide the other
on July 1 of each calendar year with a forecast of its needs for Services
from the other Party for the remainder of the Term of this Agreement, as well
as forecasts of each Party\'s own utilities consumption for the remainder of
the Term. This forecast is to be by calendar quarter for the following
calendar year and by year thereafter. The Party receiving the forecast will
use it in the determination of the allocation of costs for the next calendar
year.   Each Party\'s consumption of each Utility Service will be
established for each calendar year on an allocation basis utilizing the
methodology for the determination of the assessment quantities that has been
used, historically, by Pfizer.  7. COST OF SERVICES   a. The 2000 annual
cost of each Support and Administrative Service is listed in Appendix A. The
following year annual cost for each Support and Administrative Service
(beginning with 2001) will be determined by December 1 of the preceding year,
based on the forecasts provided by each Party pursuant to Section 6 hereof.
The cost for such Services will be equal to the Fully Allocated Cost to the
provider of the Services in providing the Services to the other Party. At the
beginning of each calendar quarter during the Term, the cost for each Support
and Administrative Service will be adjusted and indexed
for inflation/deflation using the IGP-M- FGV Index for the corresponding time
period (or as nearly corresponding as possible). If any Support and
Administrative Service is provided for a partial year, the cost thereof shall
be pro-rated for the amount of time during which the Service is actually
provided.   b. The 2000 unit costs for each Utility Service is listed in
Appendix B. Charges for these Services shall be on a use basis or as
otherwise described in Appendix C. The following year annual cost for each
Utility Service (beginning with 2001) will be determined by October 1 of the
preceding year, based on the forecasts provided by each Party pursuant to
Section 6 hereof. The cost for such Services will be equal to the Fully
Allocated Cost of the provider of the Services in providing the Services to
the other. The cost determined by this process will be in effect for the full
calendar year. At the beginning of each calendar quarter, the cost for each
Utility Service also will be adjusted and indexed for inflation/deflation
using changes to the IGP-M-FGV Index for the corresponding time period (or as
nearly corresponding as possible). Should the annual quantity of any Utility
Service consumed by either Party vary by more than    4   20% from the
most recent July 1 forecast that was used to determine the cost of the
Utility Service, then the cost of each such Utility Service will
be recalculated based on the actual consumption levels of that Utility
Service during such year. In addition, should the cost of any component of
Utility Service, other than those provided by the Party that owns the Utility
Service, changes in cost from one calendar quarter to the next and if such
cost change would result in a change of the Fully Allocated Cost of that
Utility Service of more than 1%, in which case the unit cost for that Utility
Service would be appropriately adjusted to reflect the increased Fully
Allocated Cost in providing the Service, but only to the extent that the
total cost change of that component is greater, positively or negatively,
than the change in the IGP-M-FGV index for the corresponding calendar
quarter..  8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION   a. Subject to the
last sentence of this Section 8.a., if Pfizer fails to provide the quantity
or quality of Pfizer Services required by this Agreement and as a result,
Phibro obtains replacement Services from a third party, Pfizer\'s liability
shall be limited to (and Phibro\'s sole remedy shall be to be reimbursed by
Pfizer for) Phibro\'s incremental cost of obtaining such Pfizer Service from
such third party in excess of the Fully Allocated Cost of the Services until
the earlier of such time as (i) such Pfizer Services are restored to the
level and quality of Service as was provided prior to such failure,
(ii) Pfizer is no longer required to provide such Pfizer Service, or (iii)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof; provided, that
Phibro shall exercise all reasonable efforts under the circumstances to
minimize the cost of any such alternatives to the Pfizer Services by
selecting the most commercially reasonable cost effective alternatives which
provide the functional equivalent of the Pfizer Services replaced; and
provided, further, that in no event shall Pfizer\'s maximum aggregate
liability under this Section 8.a exceed $2,000,000. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Pfizer will have no such liability to Phibro unless its failure to
provide the quantity or quality of Pfizer Services required by this Agreement
was due to its gross negligence or willful misconduct.   b. Subject to the
last sentence of this Section 8.b., if Phibro fails to provide the quantity
or quality of Phibro Services required by this Agreement and as a result,
Pfizer obtains replacement Services from a third party, Phibro\'s liability
shall be limited to (and Pfizer\'s sole remedy shall be to be reimbursed by
Phibro for) Pfizer\'s incremental cost of obtaining such Phibro Service from
such third party in excess of the Fully Allocated Cost of the Services until
the earlier of such time as (i) such Phibro Services are restored, (ii)
Phibro is no longer required to provide such Phibro Service, or (iii) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof; provided, that Pfizer
shall exercise all reasonable efforts under the circumstances to minimize the
cost of any such alternatives to the Phibro Services by selecting the
most commercially reasonable cost effective alternatives which provide the
functional equivalent of the Phibro Services replaced; and provided, further,
that in no event shall Phibro\'s maximum aggregate liability under this
Section 8.b. exceed $5,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Phibro will
have no such liability to Pfizer unless its failure to provide the quantity
or quality of    5   Phibro Services required by this Agreement was due
to its gross negligence or willful misconduct.   c. Subject to the
limitations in Sections 8.a. and 8.b. herein, each Party shall indemnify,
defend and hold the other and its Affiliates harmless from, against and in
respect of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by or
asserted against said other Party or any of its Affiliates, directly
or indirectly relating to or arising out of (i) any breach of this Agreement,
(ii) damage to, if Phibro is the Indemnifying Party, the Pfizer Property or
if Pfizer is the Indemnifying Party, the Phibro Property, solely related to
or in connection with the provision of Services, the exercise of any rights
or the fulfillment of any obligations hereunder by such Party hereunder, and
(iii) any violation of Law on the part of an Indemnifying Party.   d.
Phibro hereby agrees that it will operate the manufacturing
operations, process wastewater system, solid waste management system, process
and gas emissions systems and scrubber system discharges in accordance with
(i) all applicable laws, rules and regulations and (ii) Pfizer\'s practices
and procedures for the operation of such systems as such exist or are applied
on the date hereof. Phibro shall indemnify, defend and hold Pfizer and its
Affiliates harmless from, against and in respect of any Losses imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted against Pfizer or any of its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly relating to or arising out of Phibro\'s
process wastewater system, solid waste management, gas emissions, scrubber
system discharges or any other equipment, operation or process that leads to
any complaint, charge, allegation, or other action by CETESB or any other
regulatory agency or the public, unless the Losses are caused by Pfizer\'s
breach of this Agreement or unless the Loss is cause by Pfizer\'s violation
of Law. The $5,000,000 liability limitation provided or in Section 8.b does
not apply to this Section.   e. Neither Party shall be liable to the other
Party for loss of profit, goodwill or other special or consequential damages
as a result of any breach of this Agreement, unless such breach is due to
willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the breaching
Party.   f. The amount of any Loss for which one Party provides
indemnification shall be net of any insurance proceeds or other
reimbursements from third parties received by the Party sustaining the
Loss.   g. The procedures for indemnification hereunder shall be as set
forth in Sections 8.3, 8.4 and 8.10 of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Such
Sections of the Asset Purchase Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and all references therein to the "Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to
this Agreement for purposes hereof.    6   9. UTILITY SERVICES   a.
The Parties shall organize a committee, composed of the respective
site leaders, the utilities managers and the EHS managers, that will oversee
the operation and regulatory compliance of all utilities and environmental
control facilities located on the Phibro Property and the Pfizer Property
(the "Utilities and Environmental Management Committee"). The mission of
the Utilities and Environmental Management Committee is to assure that Pfizer
and Phibro, respectively, are conducting their operations in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. Disagreement between Pfizer and Phibro over
any fundamental issue shall be referred jointly to the Guarulhos site leaders
of Pfizer and Phibro for resolution, failing which, either party shall have
the right to refer the dispute jointly to Pfizer\'s President, Global
Manufacturing and Phibro\'s Chief Operating Officer for final resolution.  
b. Each Party\'s obligation to provide Utility Services is limited to
that contained in Appendices B and C.   (i) The annual capacity of each
Utility Service as of [ ], 2000,  the 2000 utilization of each Utility
Service by Pfizer and those  operations that are to be owned by Phibro and
the estimated future  utilization by Pfizer and by Phibro are listed in the
Addendum to Appendix  B.   (ii) During the Term of this Agreement, the
Parties will provide,  upon the other Party\'s reasonable request and at the
then unit cost for  each Utility Service, additional quantities of Utility
Services if Pfizer  or Phibro, as the case may be, has sufficient excess
capacity after  providing for reserves to assure an adequate margin of
capacity for  existing uses.   c. Each Party will operate and maintain the
assets that each Party owns that are used to provide Utility Services in the
same manner as has been Pfizer\'s custom prior to the Closing and with the
objective of providing reliable Utility Services.   d. Except as described
below, neither Party is obligated to make any capital investment for the
expansion of utilities capacity.   e. Each Party must notify the other of
any limitations on its ability to provide Utility Services that result from
operational, maintenance or regulatory issues.   f. The Parties will
coordinate their production schedules to accommodate planned shutdowns and
service interruptions.   g. Capital costs for any expansion of utilities
capacity beyond the levels shown on the Addendum to Appendix B required to
accommodate production growth shall be borne by Phibro, as the majority
utility user in light of the excess capacity that currently exists, except in
the event    7   that Pfizer\'s proposed consumption of a Utility
Service exceeds its 2000 consumption of that Utility Service as shown in
Appendix B by more than XX%, in which case Pfizer may elect to reduce its
consumption of that Utility Service to below the XX% increase threshold, or
will contribute to the capital cost necessary for the expansion of that
Utility Service on a pro rata basis, with Pfizer\'s share of the cost being
Pfizer\'s incremental usage of the Utility Service (above the 2000 base
usage) divided by Phibro\'s total increase in the usage of the Utility
Service (above the 2000 base usage), times 100%.   h. If the level of any
Utility Service must be curtailed due to a regulatory requirement, or for
operational reasons, unless such curtailment was the result of the failure of
the Utility Service provider to adhere to regulatory requirements or
appropriate operating practices, then any reduction, modification or
elimination of the emission or discharge which triggered the regulatory
requirement will be borne pro-rata by the Parties based on each Party\'s
anticipated proportionate contribution to the emission or discharge. The same
pro-rata distribution will be applied to any costs that are necessary
to achieve the reduction, modification or elimination or any other action
necessary to allow the resumption of full Utility Service. If the curtailment
was due to a violation of regulatory requirements or failure to operate in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, then the service provider
is obliged to provide the same level of service to the other Party as was
being provided immediately prior to the curtailment.  10. TERM; TERMINATION
AND SUSPENSION   a. The duration of this Agreement with respect to the
Utility Services is for a period of two (2) years from the date herein,
subject to extension as provided below (the "Utility Term"). Pfizer has the
option of extending any Utility Term for successive six (6) month periods,
effective upon the expiration of the previous corresponding Utility Term;
provided, however, that Pfizer provides notice to Phibro of its intention to
do so, in writing, not less than three (3) months prior to the expiration of
the previous Utility Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Well Water from
Pfizer is not subject to the Utility Term, and Pfizer will supply such Well
Water indefinitely, subject, however, to Pfizer\'s ability to supply water
from the subject wells based on the output of said wells and Pfizer\'s
captive use of water from those wells after the water utilities have been
separated. With respect to the Support and Administrative Services, the
duration of this Agreement (the "SandA; Term") is defined specifically, by each
Support and Administrative Service, in Appendices C (collectively, with the
Utility Term, the "Term").   b. Either party has the right to terminate its
obligation to purchase any or all Services as follows: (i) with respect to a
Utility Service, on not less than twelve (12) months advance written notice
to the other party, which notice may not be given prior to one (1) year from
the date hereof; and (ii) with respect to Support and Administrative
Services, on not less than three (3) months advance written notice to the
other party.    8    c. Either Party may terminate this Agreement in the
event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other Party, if: (i)
within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of such breach, the
breaching Party has not commenced and is not diligently implementing such a
cure; or (ii) the breach has continued uncured for a period of sixty (60)
days after the breaching Party has been notified in writing of such
breach.   d. In addition to any other remedies either Party may have at law,
equity or under this Agreement, either Party may terminate this Agreement in
the event the other Party fails to comply with the constraints set forth in
Section 14 of this Agreement.  11. CONFIDENTIALITY   a. Each Party
recognizes that in the performance of this Agreement or as a result of the
Parties\' ongoing relationships, confidential and/or proprietary information
belonging to the other Party regarding the Services or any other information
about the other Party may be disclosed or become known to the other Party or
its respective Affiliates ("Confidential Information"). Unless otherwise
expressed in writing to the other Party, any oral, visual or
written information, that is exchanged between the Parties shall be presumed
to be Confidential Information. Each Party agrees to take the necessary
precautions to assure that the other Party\'s Confidential Information
remains confidential and to hold in confidence after termination of this
Agreement any and all oral, visual or written confidential and/or proprietary
information with respect to the Services or any other information about the
other Party which belongs to the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
that this obligation shall not apply to:   (i) information that, at the
time of disclosure, is in the public  domain;   (ii) information that,
after disclosure, is published or otherwise  becomes part of the public
domain through no fault of the Party to whom  the information was
disclosed;   (iii) information that a Party can show through its records was
in  its possession or the possession of an Affiliate at the time of
disclosure  (except for Confidential Information regarding the Business in
Pfizer\'s  possession, which shall continue to be confidential); and   (iv)
information that may be received by a Party in good faith from  a source
other than the other Party, which source either has no duty of  nondisclosure
to such other Party or, if such source does have a duty of  non-disclosure,
the receiving Party was unaware of or had no reasonable  basis for knowing
thereof.   b. Each Party shall maintain the right to disclose
Confidential Information if required to do so by Law, but shall endeavor to
keep and assist the other Party in keeping it confidential by all appropriate
means, and shall afford the other Party the opportunity to contest the
disclosure obligation. If a Party finds it necessary to disclose any such
information in any judicial or    9   administrative hearing or
proceeding, the Party shall attempt to disclose such information "in camera"
or subject to "protective order" or on some other non-public basis.   c.
The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and as to any particular piece of Confidential Information,
shall continue for a period of five (5) years from such termination or until
such information becomes public knowledge through no fault of either Party,
whichever occurs first. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason
whatsoever, each Party will make no further use or disclosure of such
Confidential Information and upon written request, such Party further will
immediately deliver to the other Party all such Confidential Information as
shall be in written or other tangible form (including all copies thereof);
provided, that one copy of any document may be kept by the legal department
of each Party solely to ascertain its obligations.  12. COMPLIANCE WITH
LAWS   Each Party agrees to comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws in respect of providing and use of the Services set forth
herein.  13. COOPERATION   The Parties hereto acknowledge that the
operation of each of their respective facilities and the conduct of
operations thereto will occur in close proximity to each other. Accordingly,
the Parties agree to: (i) be considerate of each other and each Party\'s
operations; (ii) communicate with each other from time to time on matters
which may, in the reasonable judgment of each such Party, affect the other
Party, its facilities or its operations at the Guarulhos Property, including,
without limitation, communicating with each other regarding planned or
anticipated shutdowns or interruptions of Services or fluctuations
in production schedules; (iii) provide each other copies of any written
studies, reports or audits provided to or obtained from any Governmental
Authority which relate to environmental or employee health and safety
matters; (iv) establish and enforce policies and procedures requiring the
continuous and effective operation of all emission control devices on each
Party\'s site; and (v) prepare, implement and give each other a hazardous
substance accidental release prevention/minimization plan which is designed
to prevent accidental releases, to minimize the consequences of those that
happen and to provide each other with adequate notice of activities involving
the shipment, delivery, presence or generation of hazardous
substances.  14. EASEMENTS AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS [Additional easements
to come.]   a. The Parties agree to grant each other and their successors
and assigns reciprocal easements or reservations of rights for access to (1)
maintain and/or repair structures or facilities on the other Party\'s
property used in connection with the provision of Services and (2) during the
time Services are provided, to inspect and monitor the other Party\'s
activities and audit such Party\'s compliance with Environmental Laws as such
activities and compliance relate to the    10   Services to be provided
pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party\'s grant or reservation of rights
for access to audit or inspect obligates such Party to inspect or audit the
other\'s activities or relieves either Party of any duty or obligation to do
so under this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement or pursuant to
Environmental Law.   b. In addition to the foregoing and any limitations and
restrictions in the Appendices to this Agreement, the Parties covenant and
agree that neither they nor their successors and assigns will use or store
Hazardous Substances at locations which violate setback requirements under
applicable Laws or other reasonable setback requirements imposed by either
Party on the other to prevent or minimize adverse impacts to the requesting
Party\'s property; provided, however, that neither Party may request such
additional restrictions on the other to apply to Hazardous Substances as
presently used or stored by the Business.  15. MISCELLANEOUS   a. Neither
Party shall be responsible for failure or delay in performance of any
Services, nor shall either Party be responsible for failure or delay
in receiving such Service, if caused by an act of God, act of public enemy,
war, government acts or regulations, fire, flood, hurricane, embargo,
quarantine, epidemic, labor stoppages beyond its reasonable control,
accident, explosion, unusually severe weather or other cause similar or
dissimilar to the foregoing beyond their control ("Force Majeure").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Services are available after the
occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the Parties shall each be entitled to,
and the other Party shall provide, a level of Services equivalent to the
proportionate share of the Services used by the Parties immediately prior to
the occurrence of any such Force Majeure event.   b. This Agreement shall
not be assignable either in whole or in part by either Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party, except that either Party may assign
this Agreement in whole or in part to any Affiliate; provided, that any such
assignment shall not relieve the assignor of its respective obligations under
this Agreement. Any assignment, regardless of whether to an Affiliate or(with
the consent of the non-assigning Party) to a third party, must include a
written commitment by the assignee to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement.   c. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be in
writing and signed by the Party against whom it is to be effective in order
to be effective. A waiver in one instance of a provision shall not be deemed
a waiver of such term or condition in any other instance. No failure or delay
by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. Any amendment of this Agreement must be in writing

Party shall provide the other Party and its auditors and authorized
representatives such information relating to the Services and the accuracy of

except as specifically provided in Sections 8.a and 8.b of this Agreement,
that the provisions of this Agreement are unique and that it would be
impractical to measure damages in the event of a breach of this Agreement.
Accordingly, subject to the limitation on damages in Sections 8.a and 8.b
hereof, any other breach of this Agreement shall    13   entitle the
injured party to equitable relief (including specific performance

Phibro, on the one hand, and Pfizer on the other, acknowledge that they are
separate entities, each of which has entered into this Agreement

and shall not be deemed to be any indication of the meaning of the clauses to
which they relate.   o. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
laws, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall,
for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never
been contained herein unless the deletion of such provision or provisions
would result in such a material change as to cause completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be unreasonable.    14    IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed the date first herein written.

2000  Philipp Brothers Chemicals, Inc. One Parker Plaza Fort Lee, New
Jersey 07024  Re: Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as  of
September 28, 2000, between Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer")  and Philipp Brothers
Chemicals, Inc. ("Purchaser")  Gentlemen:   Reference is made to the
above-mentioned Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings assigned thereto in the Agreement.   1. Affected
Jurisdictions. (a) Notwithstanding that the Closing under the Agreement is
occurring on the date of this letter agreement, pursuant to Section
7.3(d)(ii) of the Agreement, closing of the transfer of the shares of capital
stock or assets, as the case may be, and control of the Business
(the "Transfer") located in Japan and China (individually, an
"Affected Jurisdiction," and collectively the "Affected Jurisdictions") will
be delayed with respect to each Business in the Affected Jurisdictions until
all of the steps to closing in the applicable Affected Jurisdiction have been
taken and completed (such date being referred to as the "Affected
Jurisdiction Transfer Date"). Each Transfer will be effected on its
respective Affected Jurisdiction Transfer Date without any further action on
the part of either Pfizer or Purchaser or their respective Affiliates in the
Affected Jurisdictions.   (b) On, or as soon as practicable after each
Affected Jurisdiction Transfer Date (and no later than 60 calendar days
thereafter), Pfizer shall notify the Purchaser in writing of the Applicable
Settlement Amount (as defined in Section 1.1(f)). Subject to Section 1.1(f),
the Applicable Settlement Amount, if any, shall be determined by Pfizer in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the past practices of
such Business in the Affected Jurisdiction. Pfizer shall provide Purchaser
with access to the books, records and personnel of the Business in the
Affected Jurisdiction necessary for Purchaser to properly examine Pfizer\'s
calculations in this regard. Purchaser may, in each case, dispute Pfizer\'s
calculation of the Applicable Settlement Amount, but only on the basis that
either (i) the Applicable Settlement Amount was not determined in accordance
with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with   the past practices of the
Business located in the Affected Jurisdiction; or (ii) in the event that the
terms of the Agreement or this letter agreement are breached; provided,
however, the Purchaser shall notify Pfizer in writing of the amount of the
Applicable Settlement Amount in dispute and the reasons therefor, or the
nature of the breach as appropriate, within thirty (30) days, in each case,
after notification of the Applicable Settlement Amount. The failure
by Purchaser to provide a notice of dispute within such thirty (30) day
period will constitute the Purchaser\'s acceptance of Pfizer\'s calculation
of the Applicable Settlement Amount. Pfizer shall provide Purchaser with
access to the books, records, and personnel of the Business in the Affected
Jurisdictions necessary for Purchaser to properly examine the calculation of
the Applicable Settlement Amount.   (c) If a notice of dispute shall be
timely delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph, Pfizer and Purchaser
shall, during the thirty (30) Business Days following the date of such
delivery, negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed amount. If the
parties are unable to reach an agreement during such time period, the parties
shall refer the dispute to the Accounting Expert referenced in Section 2.7(c)
of the Agreement. The Accounting Expert shall make a determination with
respect to the unresolved amount of the Applicable Settlement Amount in
dispute within fifteen (15) calendar days after its engagement by Pfizer and
the Purchaser. The Accounting Expert shall deliver to Pfizer and the
Purchaser, within such fifteen (15) day period, a report setting forth its
adjustment, if any, to the Applicable Settlement Amount and the calculation
supporting such adjustment. The determination of the Accounting Expert shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. Pfizer and Purchaser shall
each pay one-half of all costs incurred in connection with the engagement of
the Accounting Expert.   (d) The Applicable Settlement Amount shall be
deemed final for the purposes of this letter agreement upon the earlier of
(i) the failure of the Purchaser to notify Pfizer of a dispute within thirty
(30) days of Pfizer\'s notification to the Purchaser of the Settlement Amount
or (ii) the resolution pursuant to Section 1(c) of any dispute for which the
Purchaser provided proper notification under Section 1(b) to Pfizer.   (e)
(i) Within three Business Days of the Applicable Settlement Amount being
deemed final under Section 1(d), if the final Applicable Settlement Amount is
a positive number, the local Pfizer Affiliate will pay the Applicable
Settlement Amount in local currency to the local Purchaser Affiliate in the
applicable Affected Jurisdiction by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Purchaser in writing.   (ii) Within
three Business Days of the Settlement Amount being deemed final under Section
1(d), if the final Settlement Amount is a negative number, the local
Purchaser Affiliate will pay the Settlement Amount in local currency to the
local Pfizer Affiliate in the Affected Jurisdiction by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser in
writing.    (f) The local Pfizer and Purchaser Affiliates shall within
a period of 60 days after each Affected Jurisdiction Transfer Date calculate
the Applicable Settlement Amount and, if appropriate, make such additional
payments to each other as may be necessary to ensure that they are placed in
the same economic position as if the Business had been transferred to the
local Purchaser Affiliate on the date hereof. The Applicable Settlement
Amount shall be defined as the local currency net cash flow of the business,
that has been experienced in the Affected Jurisdiction during the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Affected Jurisdiction
Transfer Date (the "Affected Jurisdiction Interim"), meaning (x) the amount
of receivables collected on sales that occurred after the Closing Date less
(y) the sum of (1) SGandA; costs, (2) freight and distribution costs, (3)
payables and (4) income and any other applicable Taxes. For the avoidance of
doubt, all receivables and payables generated during the Affected
Jurisdiction Interim and remaining unsettled as of the Affected Jurisdiction
Transfer Date shall be for the account of the local Purchaser Affiliate.  
2. Conduct of the Business. (a) During the Affected Jurisdiction Interim,
Pfizer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, conduct the Business in the
Affected Jurisdictions in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past
practice and in compliance with all applicable Laws. During the
Affected Jurisdiction Interim, Pfizer shall cause the Business in the
Affected Jurisdictions to adhere to the requirements set forth in Section 7.2
of the Agreement.   (b) During the Affected Jurisdiction Interim, Pfizer
shall cause the Business in such Affected Jurisdictions to maintain, in all
material respects, true and complete books of account containing an accurate
record of all data necessary for the proper computation of the Settlement
Amount.   (c) During the Affected Jurisdiction Interim, Purchaser
shall have, to the maximum extent legally permissible, day-to-day managerial
control over the Business in the Affected Jurisdictions and Pfizer shall
follow the directions of Purchaser and its authorized representatives in this
regard. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Pfizer nor its Affiliates
shall hire or terminate any employee of the Business in the Affected
Jurisdictions during the Affected Jurisdiction Interim without the prior
consent of Purchaser.   3. Information and Documents. During the applicable
Affected Jurisdiction Interim, Pfizer and its Affiliates shall permit
Purchaser and its representatives to have access to the Business in the
Affected Jurisdiction on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 7.1 of
the Agreement.   4. Aggregate Payment and Related Matters. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this letter agreement, the Closing Date Payment shall not
be affected by any term or provision of this letter agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this letter agreement, the Inventories of the
Business as of the Closing Date relating to the Affected Jurisdictions shall
be calculated as of the Closing Date.    5. Responsibility for
Liabilities. As of and from the Affected Jurisdiction Transfer Date,
Purchaser shall assume, pay and discharge all Liabilities resulting from the
operation of or otherwise relating to the Business in the applicable Affected
Jurisdiction that remain outstanding as of such date to the extent such
Liabilities would be Assumed Liabilities.   6. General Provisions. The
provisions of Article X of the Agreement shall be deemed incorporated into
this letter agreement by reference, as if herein fully set out.

agreement with the foregoing by executing this letter agreement in the space

accrue and be payable at the Applicable Rate as set forth in this Section
