Party is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third-Party Claim unless the portion of such Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party would be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this <U>Article 10</U> (after giving effect to the limitations in <U>Section&nbsp;10.5</U> and
all other claims for indemnification under this Agreement) is less than 50% of the aggregate Losses claimed in such Third-Party Claim (or, if the amount of Losses is not specified, a reasonable estimate thereof). If the Indemnifying Party is
entitled to and elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with a Third-Party Claim, it shall, within 60 days of the Indemnifying Party&#146;s receipt of the Officer&#146;s Certificate with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment contains an unqualified release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of the Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to or elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim using counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. The party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim
(the &#147;<U>Controlling Party</U>&#148;) shall (i)&nbsp;permit the other party (the &#147;<U>Non-Controlling Party</U>&#148;) to participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (ii)&nbsp;conduct the defense of
such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably informed of material developments in such Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof, (iii)&nbsp;promptly submit to the Non-Controlling Party copies of all
