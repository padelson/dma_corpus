respect to which the relevant US Options shall become vested and exercisable
at the Closing (whether in accordance with the terms of the applicable Option
Agreement or at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors) in
connection with the Merger (each such US Option, a " _US Vested Option_ ").
The US Vested Options with an exercise price less than the Closing Date Per
Share Merger Consideration (each, a " _US In-the-Money Vested Option_ ")
shall be deemed cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time without any
future liability to Purchaser (other than as specifically set forth in
_Section 2.12_ and _Section 2.13_), the Company or any other Person after
the Effective Time, into the right to receive from the Company the In-the-
Money Vested Option Cancellation Payment payable in accordance with _Section
2.11_ and _Section 2.12_. The shares with respect to the Options that shall
not become vested (i.e., to the extent not vested in accordance with the
applicable Option Agreement or at the discretion of the Companys Board of
Directors) shall immediately prior to the Effective Time automatically
be extinguished and cancelled without the right to receive any consideration
(with no payment being made hereunder with respect thereto). Options with an
exercise price that exceeds, or US Options with an exercise price that is
equal to, the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration shall immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to the extent not exercised by the holder thereof
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Equity
Incentive Plan, automatically be extinguished and cancelled without the right
to receive any consideration (with no payment being made hereunder with
respect thereto). As a condition to the receipt of the foregoing consideration
provided in this _Section 2.9(a)_, each holder of a US In-the-Money Vested
Option shall agree and acknowledge in an option surrender form substantially
in the form of _Exhibit C_ hereto (the " _US Option Surrender Form_ "), with
such modifications as may be necessary, in each case, in a manner reasonably
acceptable to each of Purchaser and the Company, that such holder (A) approves
of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements relating
thereto, (B) approves the appointment of the Representative in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, (C) represents and warrants that it is the
owner of all such US In-the-Money Vested Options free and clear of all Liens
and (D) acknowledges that such US Optionholders portion of the US In-the-
Money Vested Option Cancellation Payment constitutes all of the consideration
such US Optionholder is entitled to receive with respect to the US In-the-
Money Vested Options held by such US Optionholder.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall send a notice (the " _UK Option Notice_ ") to all UK Optionholders,
which UK Option Notice shall notify such UK Optionholder of the number of
shares with respect to which the relevant UK Options shall become vested and
exercisable at the Closing (whether in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Option Agreement or at the discretion of the Companys Board of
Directors) in connection with the Merger (each such UK Option, a " _UK Vested
Option_ "). The UK Vested Options with an exercise price less than or equal
to the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration (each, a " _UK In-the-Money
Vested Option_ ") shall become exercisable before the Closing. UK
Optionholders will be offered the opportunity to exercise their UK In-the-
Money Vested Options, conditional upon the occurrence of, but occurring
immediately prior to, the Closing, and any UK In-the-Money Vested Options not
so exercised shall lapse and shall be extinguished and cancelled immediately
after Closing without the right to

 



16  receive any consideration (with no payment being made hereunder with respect
thereto). The Shares issued on the exercise of such UK In-the-Money Vested
Options are to be dealt with in accordance with _Section 2.8_ in the same
manner as the other Outstanding Shares; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt and as provided in the UK Option Exercise Form, the amount payable to
each Exercising UK Optionholder on the Closing Date pursuant to _Section
2.11_ shall be reduced by the aggregate exercise price of all UK In-the-Money
Vested Options exercised by such Exercising UK Optionholder in accordance with
this _Section 2.9(b)_. As a condition to the conditional exercise provided
for in this _Section 2.9_, each holder of a UK In-the-Money Vested Option
shall agree and acknowledge in an option exercise form substantially in the
form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _UK Option Exercise Form_ "), with such
modifications as may be necessary, in each case, in a manner reasonably
acceptable to each of Purchaser and the Company, that such holder (A) approves
of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements relating
thereto, (B) approves the appointment of the Representative in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, (C) represents and warrants that it is the owner
of all such UK In-the-Money Vested Options free and clear of all Liens and
(D) acknowledges that such UK Optionholders portion of the Final Merger
Consideration constitutes all of the consideration such UK Optionholder is
entitled to receive with respect to the UK In-the-Money Vested Options held
by such UK Optionholder.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Equity Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time and
to ensure that no member of the Company Group will, at the Effective Time, be
bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, warrants, restricted stock
rights, restricted stock units, phantom equity awards or other rights or
agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, to own any equity interests in the Surviving Company or to
receive any payment in respect thereof.

 

(d) The Company shall, in accordance with the Equity Incentive Plan, notify
each holder of Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested) that, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holders thereof, each share
of Restricted Stock shall, (i) to the extent then unvested, accelerate
and become fully vested in accordance with the Equity Incentive Plan, and
(ii) be converted into the right to receive in exchange for the cancellation
of such Restricted Stock, an amount equal to the product of the number of each
share of Restricted Stock held by such holder and the Closing Date Per Share
Merger Consideration.

2.10 _Pre-Closing Statement_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall in good faith prepare and deliver to Purchaser
a written statement (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ "), based upon the books
and records of the Company Group, which shall set forth the Companys good
faith estimate of (i) Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "),
(ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness (" _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_
"), (iii) the Seller Expenses (" _Estimated Seller Expenses_ ") (and wire
instructions for the payment thereof), (iv) Closing Date Cash and Cash
Equivalents (" _Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents_ ") and (v) the Closing
Date Merger Consideration based upon such items.

 



17 2.11 _Closing Payments_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay, on behalf of the Company, to such
accounts designated in any Payoff Letters with respect to the Secured Credit
Facilities delivered at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, the
amount set forth therein.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay, with respect to each Stockholder who
shall have delivered to the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date a
completed letter of transmittal substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_
hereto (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and certificate(s) representing the
Outstanding Shares (subject to _Section 2.11(h)_) held by such Stockholder,
an amount equal to the product of the number of Outstanding Shares held by
such Stockholder and the Closing Date Per Share Merger Consideration, which
amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the
Closing Date to the account designated in such Stockholders Letter of
Transmittal. 

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to the Company, for the benefit of and
for payment to the US Optionholders in accordance with this _Article 2_ , by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
designated by the Company to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the aggregate amount of all US In-the-Money Vested Option
Cancellation Payments. Promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days) following the Closing, Purchaser shall, with respect to each holder of a
US In-the-Money Vested Option, who shall have delivered to the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date, a completed US Option Surrender Form relating to
such US Optionholders In-the-Money Vested Options, cause the Surviving
Company to pay to such holder, through the Surviving Companys payroll system
(with respect to US Optionholders who are employed by the Company Group at the
time of such payment) or pursuant to the payment instructions set forth in
such holders US Option Surrender Form (with respect to US Optionholders who
are not employed by the Company Group at the time of such payment), in
consideration of the cancellation of such US In-the-Money Vested Option, the
applicable US In-the Money Vested Option Cancellation Payment, less any
required withholding Taxes and without interest thereon.

(d) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay, or cause the Surviving Company to
pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Estimated Seller
Expenses to the applicable recipients thereof as set forth on the Pre-Closing
Statement.

(e) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Escrow Amount
to be held in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held in the Escrow Account in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and released and paid in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide
that (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount will be used to satisfy the Adjustment
Amount, if applicable, pursuant to _Section 2.12_, and (ii) the Indemnity
Escrow Amount will be used to satisfy claims for Indemnified Losses incurred
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant and subject to _Article 10_
hereof.

(f) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Representative Expense Amount with the Representative. The
Representative Expense Amount will be used to pay costs, fees and expenses
incurred by or for the benefit of the Securityholders on or after the Closing
Date and

 



18  shall be paid or distributed at the direction of the Representative as
provided in the Letters of Transmittal and/or US Option Surrender Form.

 

(g) In the event that any certificates representing Outstanding Shares have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of
that fact by the Stockholder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Surviving Company will pay, in exchange for the Outstanding
Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Closing
Date Per Share Merger Consideration and all other amounts otherwise payable
hereunder.

(h) Any remaining cash unclaimed by holders of Outstanding Shares and US In-
the-Money Vested Options as of a date which is immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable portion
of the Final Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amount as the Surviving Company is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any other applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(j) The Company and Purchaser agree for all tax purposes that: (i) the right
of the Securityholders to the Escrow Amount shall be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale treatment under
Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. law, as appropriate; (ii) interest may be imputed on such amount, as
required by Section 483 or 1274 of the Code; and (iii) Purchaser shall be
treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount and all interest and earnings earned
from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or portion thereof,
shall be allocable to Purchaser pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and
Proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.468B-8.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any payments
pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ to an Exercising UK Optionholder in respect
of Outstanding Shares issued upon the exercise of UK Options in accordance
with _Section 2.9(b)_ or to a Stockholder in respect of shares of Restricted
Stock shall be made through the Surviving Companys payroll system.

 

2.12 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment and Payments_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing, Purchaser shall in good faith prepare and deliver to
the Representative a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), based
upon the books and records of the Company Group, which shall set forth
Purchasers calculation of (i) Working Capital, which shall be based
exclusively on the facts and circumstances as they exist as of the Measurement
Time, and shall be calculated without giving effect to the Merger or to other
events arising as a result of the Merger that are not caused by any
actions outside the Ordinary Course of Business undertaken unilaterally prior
to the Closing on the part of the Company and/or any of the Securityholders,
(ii) Closing Date Indebtedness, (iii) Seller Expenses, (iv) Closing Date Cash
and Cash Equivalents

 



19  and (v) the Final Merger Consideration based upon such items. After receipt
of the Closing Statement, the Representative and its advisors and
representatives shall have reasonable access to all relevant books and
records (including accountant work papers), accountants and employees of the
Surviving Company to the extent required to complete its review of the Closing
Statement. If, within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Representative has not given Purchaser notice of its objection
to any item in the Closing Statement reasonably detailing the basis of such
objection (an " _Objection Notice_ "), then the Closing Statement shall be
deemed final and binding on Purchaser, the Surviving Company and the
Representative (on behalf of all Securityholders). If the Representative
delivers an Objection Notice, then Purchaser and the Representative shall
consult in good faith to resolve the disputed items set forth in the
Objection Notice and, if any disputed items have not been resolved within
thirty (30) days following delivery of such notice, from and after such time
either the Representative or Purchaser may submit the remaining disputed
items to the New York, New York office of PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if such
firm is unable to serve in such capacity, to such other nationally recognized
independent public accountant that is mutually agreeable to
the Representative and Purchaser (the " _Accountant_ ") for resolution. If
any items in dispute are submitted to the Accountant for resolution: (x)
Purchaser and the Representative shall use their respective reasonable efforts
to cause the Accountant to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect
to the Closing Statement as soon as practicable but in any event shall direct
the Accountant to render a determination within forty-five (45) days after its
retention; (y) Purchaser and the Representative shall furnish to the
Accountant and each other such work papers and other documents and information
relating solely to the disputed issues as the Accountant may request and are
available to that party (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Surviving
Company or its accountants), and shall be afforded the opportunity to present
to the Accountant any materials relating to the determination and to discuss
the determination with the Accountant,  _provided_ that copies of all such
materials are concurrently provided to the other party and that such
discussions may only occur in the presence (including by telephone) of the
other party, _provided_ _further_ that the Accountant shall consider only
those items and amounts which are identified as being in dispute; and (z) the
determination by the Accountant of the disputed items in the Closing
Statement, as shall be set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by
the Accountant, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. In resolving
any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The fees of the
Accountant for such determination shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Securityholders, on the other hand, in proportion to the portion
of the aggregate amount in dispute that is finally resolved by the Accountant
in a manner adverse to such party. For example, if the Purchaser claims the
appropriate adjustments are $1,000 less than the amount determined by the
Representative, and the Representative contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Purchaser, and if the Accountant ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Purchaser $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accountant will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300/500) to
the Securityholders and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200/500) to the Purchaser.

(b) The Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as follows
(without duplication): (i)(A) increased by the amount, if any, by which the
Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ ("
_Final Working Capital_ "), is greater than the Estimated Working Capital or
(B) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Working Capital is less
than the Estimated Working Capital; (ii)(A) reduced by the amount, if any, by
which the Closing Date Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant to 
_Section 2.12(a)_ (" _Final Indebtedness_ ") is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness or (B) increased by the

 



20  amount, if any, by which the Final Indebtedness is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness; (iii)(A) reduced by the amount, if any, by which
the Seller Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ ("
_Final Seller Expenses_ ") are greater than the Estimated Seller Expenses or
(B) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final Seller Expenses are
less than the Estimated Seller Expenses; and/or (iv)(A) increased by the
amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.12(a)_ (" _Final Cash and Cash
Equivalents_ ") are greater than the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents or
(B) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Cash and Cash
Equivalents are less than the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents; _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Adjustment Amount
(whether positive or negative) exceed $2,500,000.

(c) No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the final
determination of the Adjustment Amount;

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive, 

(A) with respect to each Stockholder who shall have delivered to the Company,
on or prior to such date, a completed Letter of Transmittal and
certificate(s) representing the Outstanding Shares (subject to _Section
2.11(h)_) held by such Stockholder, Purchaser shall pay, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to pay, an amount equal to the product of the number of
Outstanding Shares held by such Stockholder and the Adjustment Amount Per
Share, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated in such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal;

(B) with respect to each holder of a US In-the-Money Vested Option who has
delivered to the Company, on or prior to such date, a completed US Option
Surrender Form, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company to pay, through
the Surviving Companys payroll system (with respect to US Optionholders who
are employed by the Company Group at the time of such payment) or pursuant to
the payment instructions set forth in such holders US Option Surrender Form
(with respect to US Optionholders who are not employed by the Company Group at
the time of such payment), to each such holder, an amount equal to the excess
of (x) the product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of such US In-the-Money Vested Option and (2) the Adjustment
Amount Per Share less (y) any required withholding Taxes; and

(C) Purchaser and Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Stockholders
and to the Surviving Company (for distribution to the US Optionholders) in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share and otherwise as provided in
the Adjustment Escrow Agreement; or

(ii) subject to _Section 2.12(d)_, if the Adjustment Amount is negative,
then Purchaser and the Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Amount to be paid to
the Surviving Company solely and exclusively from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, and, if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
remaining following such payment to the Surviving

 



21  Company shall be released to the Stockholders and to the Surviving Company
(for distribution to the US Optionholders) in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Share and otherwise as provided in the Escrow Agreement; or

(iii) if the Adjustment Amount is zero, Purchaser and the Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the
entire Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Stockholders and to the Surviving
Company (for distribution to the US Optionholders) in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share and otherwise as provided in the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Representative nor
any Securityholder, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any
liability or obligation under this _Section 2.12_ for any amounts in excess
of the Adjustment Escrow Amount. Recovery from the Adjustment Escrow Amount
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Purchaser for any claims
by Purchaser against the Securityholders, or otherwise, arising out of or
relating to any negative Adjustment Amount and neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any claim
against Securityholder in respect thereof. The maximum amount payable to
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall be the Adjustment Escrow
Amount deposited in the Escrow Account, and the maximum Adjustment Amount
payable to the Securityholders pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall be
$2,500,000.

(e) The Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing
Date Merger Consideration for federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax
purposes.

(f) From and after the Closing Date:

(i) with respect to each Stockholder who shall not have delivered to the
Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, a Letter of Transmittal and
certificate(s) representing the Outstanding Shares (subject to _Section
2.11(g))_ held by such Stockholder, Purchaser shall, promptly (but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days) following such Stockholders delivery
to the Company of a completed Letter of Transmittal and certificate(s)
representing such Stockholders Outstanding Shares (subject to _Section
2.11(g))_, pay, or cause the Surviving Company to pay, all amounts that would
previously have been payable with respect to such Outstanding Shares pursuant
to this _Article 2_ had such Letter of Transmittal and certificate(s) been
delivered on or prior to the Closing Date; and

(ii) with respect to each holder of a US In-the-Money Vested Option who shall
not have delivered to the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, a US
Option Surrender Form, Purchaser shall, promptly (but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days) following such holders delivery to the Company of a
completed US Option Surrender Form, cause the Surviving Company to pay,
through the Surviving Companys payroll system (with respect to US
Optionholders who are employed by the Company Group at the time of
such payment) or pursuant to the payment instructions set forth in such
holders US Option Surrender Form (with respect to US Optionholders who are
not employed by the Company Group at the time of such payment), to such
holder, all amounts that would previously have been payable with respect to
such US In-the-Money Vested Option pursuant to this _Article 2_ had such US
Option Surrender Form been delivered on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



22 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any payments
pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ to an Exercising UK Optionholder in respect
of Outstanding Shares issued upon the exercise of UK Options in accordance
with _Section 2.9(b)_ or to a Stockholder in respect of shares of Restricted
Stock shall be made through the Surviving Companys payroll system.

2.13 _Notices to Securityholders; Dissenting Shares_.

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, mail or deliver to (i) each Stockholder and each holder of Restricted
Stock a letter from the Company (A) providing such Stockholder or such holder
of Restricted Stock with a brief information statement regarding the Company
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) with respect to each
Stockholder and each holder of Restricted Stock, (I) providing the
notification required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL with respect to the
Written Consent and (II) providing notice in the manner contemplated in
Section 262 of the DGCL of such holders right to dissent to the Merger
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) each Stockholder and each holder
of Restricted Stock, a Letter of Transmittal. The Company shall afford
Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the documents
described in this _Section 2.13(a) _and shall consider in good faith
Purchasers comments thereto.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
share of Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that is held by a Stockholder who shall have not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly
demanded appraisal for such share in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Final Per Share Merger Consideration, or
any portion thereof, in respect of such Dissenting Share. Such Stockholder
shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
share of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that any Dissenting Share held by a Stockholder who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost
his, her or its rights to appraisal of such share of Common Stock under such
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to
receive, in the manner provided in _Section 2.11_ and _Section 2.11_, the
Final Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL.

2.14 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the Common Stock
transfer books shall be closed and no transfer of Common Stock shall
thereafter be made. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the Stockholders, the Purchaser, the Company
or Merger Sub, the Outstanding Shares shall be cancelled and extinguished,
and each certificate or instrument previously representing such Outstanding
Shares shall represent only the right to receive its respective portion of the
Final Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article 2_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Company
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate(s) representing Outstanding Shares, including
Dissenting Shares.

 



23 2.15 _Transfer Taxes_. All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales,
use, registration and other such taxes, levies and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ ")
shall be borne 50/50 by the Securityholders and Purchaser, and the portion of
the Transfer Taxes to be borne by the Securityholders shall be paid by the
Company and shall constitute a Seller Expense hereunder. The Company shall
procure any stock transfer stamps required by, and properly file on a timely
basis all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to, any
Transfer Tax and all expenses associated with such shall likewise be borne
50/50 between Purchaser and the Securityholders and the portion of such
expenses to be borne by the Securityholders shall be paid by the Company and
shall constitute a Seller Expense hereunder. Purchaser shall cooperate with
the Company in filing, or causing to be filed, such Tax Returns and other
necessary documentation.

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY GROUP

Except as disclosed in a document of even date herewith delivered by the
Company to Purchaser (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "), which Disclosure
Schedule is arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered
paragraphs contained in this  _Article 3_ (and the disclosure in any such
numbered and lettered section therein shall qualify the corresponding
subsection in this _Article 3_ and any other section hereof where it is
reasonably apparent that the disclosure applies to such other section), the
Company hereby makes the representations and warranties contained in this
_Article 3_ to Purchaser, each of which is true and correct as of the date
hereof and each of which shall survive the Closing as provided in  _Section
10.1_.

3.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Other Matters; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company is (a) duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and (b) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and as presently proposed to be
conducted by it, except, where the failure to be so duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing, or to have such power and authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to conduct its business
as currently conducted in each jurisdiction in which the character or
location of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a duly incorporated or organized, as
applicable, and validly existing corporation, partnership, or other entity in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and is duly qualified or authorized to do business as a
foreign corporation or entity and is in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties requires such qualification or authorization, except where the
failure to be so qualified, authorized, or in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all requisite
corporate or entity power and authority to own its properties and carry on its
business as presently conducted, except, where the failure to have such power
and authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



24 (c) _Schedule 3.1(c)_ sets forth for each Subsidiary of the Company (i) its
name and jurisdiction of organization and (ii) its form of organization. The
Company is the sole direct or indirect legal and beneficial and record owner
of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other interests in each of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, except (x) for any restrictions on
sales of securities under applicable securities Laws, (y) for Permitted Liens
or (z) as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 3.1(c)_. All outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company are validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation of preemptive or

materials prepared by the Surviving Companys financial or legal advisors
which is subject to an attorney/client privilege or an attorney work product

and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, maintain all
such books and records in the jurisdiction in which such books and records

employees of any member of the Company Group (collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of any member of the Company Group
at any time on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that all rights
of the Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in
the respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable
organizational documents of each member of the Company Group as now in effect,
and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of any member of the
Company Group shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force

rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is
required by Law.

(b) Purchaser agrees that for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, it
shall not permit the any member of the Company Group to amend, repeal or
modify any provision in their respective Organizational Documents in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights and/or exculpation or indemnification
of present or former directors and officers, it being the intent of the
parties that the directors and officers of the Company Group prior to the
Closing shall continue thereafter to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws and
Purchaser agrees to cause each member of the Company Group to perform in a
timely manner and to otherwise honor such obligations in all respects.

Persons who are presently covered by the Company Groups officers and
directors liability insurance policy (a copy of which has heretofore been
delivered to Purchaser), with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior

insurance in effect for the Company Group on the date hereof and from an
insurer or insurers having claims paying ratings no lower than the Company
Groups current insurer.

 



46 (d) The obligations of Purchaser under this _Section 7.2_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
to whom this _Section 7.2_ applies without the consent of the affected
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 7.2_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
7.2_)

7.3 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable member of the Company Group
to, (i) give those employees who are, as of immediately prior to the Closing,
employed by the Company Group (including employees on vacation, leave of
absence, or short term disability) and whose employment continues following
the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (excluding, for purposes of benefit
accruals, any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans
or arrangements maintained by Purchaser or the Company Group (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") for such Continuing Employees service with the
Company Group (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by the
Company Group; (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Purchaser Plan
that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible
to participate in after the Closing Date; and (iii) provide credit under any
such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any
transfer of coverage occurs;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service
shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in the
duplication of benefits.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.3(a)_, Purchaser covenants
that, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser or the Company Group shall
sponsor a defined contribution pension plan and/or 401(k) plan (the "
_Purchaser Defined Contribution Plan_ ") and the Continuing Employees shall
immediately be eligible to participate in such Purchaser Defined Contribution
Plan, and further that such plan will recognize the Continuing Employees
service with the Company Group (or any predecessor entity) for all purposes
under the Purchaser Defined Contribution Plan, to the same extent each such
Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit
for such service under any similar Company Plan (" _Seller Defined
Contribution Plan_ "). Purchaser and the Company Group shall take any and all
necessary action to cause the trustee of the Purchaser Defined
Contribution Plan, if requested to do so by a Continuing Employee, to accept
a direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such employees account balance,
including any outstanding loan balance, in the Seller Defined Contribution
Plan.

 

(c) To the extent unpaid as of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall pay all
cash bonuses for fiscal year 2011 to each Company Employee pursuant to the
2011 Bonus Plan in an amount no less than the amount accrued for such purpose
on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company Group at December
31, 2011. Such payment will be made in accordance with the payment
terms specified in the 2011 Bonus Plan, or if no date is so specified, in a
manner that would not result in additional tax to a Company Employee under
Section 409A of the Code, if applicable. Nothing contained in this _Section
7.3(c)_ shall be construed as an offer of employment to any individual on
other than an employment-at-will basis, subject to the terms of any existing
employment agreement, arrangement and/or any applicable Law, and that the
foregoing shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Company Group,
Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment
of any employee at any time and for any

 



47  or no reason. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay all true-ups of
sales commissions payable to any Company Employee pursuant to the 2011 Sales
Plan.

 

(d) Nothing contained in _Section 7.3(a)_ or Section _7.3(b)_ : (i) shall
alter or limit the ability of Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Company,
or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; (ii) shall alter or
limit, except as expressly provided in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section
7.3(b)_, the Purchasers sole and absolute discretion to alter the terms and
conditions of employment of any of the Continuing Employees; (iii) shall
alter or limit, except as expressly provided in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section
7.3(b)_, the Purchasers sole and absolute discretion to choose to continue or
not to continue the employment of any of the current Company Employees
following the Closing; or (iv) is intended to confer upon any current or
former employee or any other Person any right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right
to a particular term or condition of employment.

7.4 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers; Communications with Employees_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.2_), from the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, (a) Purchaser and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), have
any contact or discussions concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any suppliers or customers of
the Company Group, and (b) Purchaser and the Company shall use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with each other with respect to the content and timing of
all communications to employees of the Company Group regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related transitional matters.
Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall provide the Company reasonable
advance notice of any communications Purchaser desires to make to employees of
the Company Group and shall consider in good faith any comments from the
Company with respect thereto.

7.5 _Harwood/Walker Payment_. In the event that (i) the employment of Charles
C. Harwood, Jr. with the Company Group under his current employment agreement
is not terminated on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, then Purchaser shall refund to the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) the applicable amount included as a Seller Expense with
respect to the portion of the Harwood/Walker Payment attributable to Mr.
Harwood and (ii) the employment of David S. Walker with the Company Group
under his current employment agreement is not terminated on or prior to the
three-month anniversary of the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall refund to
the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) the applicable amount
included as a Seller Expense with respect to the portion of the
Harwood/Walker Payment attributable to Mr. Walker.

7.6 _Closing Date Operation of Business_. From the Effective Time through and
including the Measurement Time, Purchaser shall cause the Company Group to be
operated in the Ordinary Course of Business and shall not permit any member of
the Company Group to take, or fail to take, any action that would have
constituted a breach of _Section 6.1_ of this Agreement had such action or
failure to act occurred between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time.

Indemnified Party shall mean the Representative. An Indemnified Party wishing
to assert a claim for indemnification under _Section 10.2_ (other than a
third-party claim covered by _Section 10.3(b)_ below) shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party a certificate (an " _Officer s Certificate_") signed by
any officer of the Indemnified Party, if a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or by
the Representative, if a Securityholder Indemnified Party, (A) stating that an
Indemnified Party has paid, sustained or incurred, or reasonably anticipates
that it will have to pay, sustain or incur Indemnified Losses (the aggregate
amount of such Indemnified Losses being referred to as the " _Claimed Amount_
"), (B) specifying in reasonable detail the facts pertinent to such claim(s),
the individual items of Indemnified Losses included in the amount so stated,
the method of computation thereof and the basis for indemnification to which
such item is related and (C) demanding payment of the Claimed Amount. Within
twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of such Officers Certificate, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (1) agree that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount, (2) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") or (3) contest that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. In the case of (1) or (2) above
where the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, the
Representative and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
within three (3) Business Days following delivery of the response, a written
notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to the Indemnified 

 



54  Party, from and to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, an amount
equal to the Claimed Amount or Agreed Amount, as applicable. If the
Indemnifying Party in such response contests the payment of all or part of
the Claimed Amount, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute in accordance with
_Section 10.3(c)_ below.

 

(b) _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_. All claims for indemnification made
under _Section 10.2_ resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-
party claim against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the
following procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a
third-party claim which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result
in any Indemnified Losses (without giving effect to the limitations in
_Section 10.5_) (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim by delivery of
an Officers Certificate to such Indemnifying Party. Delay or failure in so
notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of
obligations under _Section 10.2_ only to the extent, if at all, that such
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim unless the portion of such
Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party would be obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article 10_ (after giving effect to
the limitations in _Section 10.5_ and all other claims for indemnification
under this Agreement) is less than 50% of the aggregate Losses claimed in such
Third-Party Claim (or, if the amount of Losses is not specified, a reasonable
estimate thereof). If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to and elects to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with a Third-Party Claim,
it shall, within 60 days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of the Officers
Certificate with respect to such Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnified
Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at
his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a
default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment contains an unqualified release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of the Third-Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to or elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Third-Party Claim using counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party. The party controlling the defense of any Third-Party
Claim (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall (i) permit the other party (the "
_Non-Controlling Party_ ") to participate, at his or its own expense, in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) conduct the defense of such Third-
Party Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the Non-Controlling Party
reasonably informed of material developments in such Third-Party Claim at all
stages thereof, (iii) promptly submit to the Non-Controlling Party copies of
all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal
documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith, (iv) permit
the Non-Controlling Party and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the
defense thereof and (v) permit the Non-Controlling Party and its counsel an
opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted prior to their
submission and consider in good faith any comments from the Non-Controlling
Party and its counsel thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 10.3_, the Indemnified Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. In the event the
Indemnified Party fails to diligently pursue the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the 

 



55  Indemnifying Party shall thereafter have the right to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim
notwithstanding the limitation in the fourth sentence of this  _Section
10.3(b)_. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the investigation, trial and
defense of any Third-Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include
access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party and
its agents and representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified
Party of, records and information which have been identified by the
Indemnifying Party as being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim,
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Indemnifying Party shall object in
writing to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate, the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims
within forty-five (45) days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party
of its response to such Officers Certificate. If the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim
against the Indemnity Escrow Amount, shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
make distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms thereof.

10.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. With respect to any indemnity payment under
this _Article 10_ , the Parties agree to treat, to the extent permitted by
Law, all such payments as an adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration
paid hereunder.

10.5 _Limitations_.

 

(a)(i) In the event of any claim for indemnity under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_
(other than any claim for a breach of a Fundamental Representation), _Section
10.2(b)_ or _Section 10.2(d)_, a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to indemnification therefor unless such Purchaser Indemnified Party
has sustained Indemnified Losses in excess of $5,250,000 in the aggregate
(the " _Threshold_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to all sustained Indemnified Losses that are in excess of the
Threshold (subject to _Section 10.5(a)(ii)_ below); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event of any claim for indemnity under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_
(other than any claim for a breach of a Fundamental Representation), _Section
10.2(b)_ or  _Section 10.2(d)_, the Securityholders shall only be liable for
indemnification under this _Article 10_ for individual Indemnified Losses
(that are not related to any other Indemnified Losses) that are in excess of
$75,000 (a " _Qualifying Loss_ "), _provided_ , that for the avoidance of
doubt, whenever multiple situations exist that give rise to an Indemnified
Loss or Indemnified Losses based on the same or substantially the same set of
actions, inactions, facts or circumstances, such multiple situations shall be
aggregated to constitute a single Indemnified Loss for purposes of determining
Qualifying Losses in accordance with the preceding clause. Only Qualifying
Losses shall be taken into account in determining whether the Threshold has
been satisfied.

(ii) Except in the limited circumstances expressly provided in _Sections
10.5(h)_ and _10.6_ , and except for any claim for a breach of a Fundamental
Representation, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Purchaser 

 



56  Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement for any Indemnified Losses in excess of the then remaining portion
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to any Losses to the extent that such Losses are reflected in Final
Working Capital and (ii) all Losses under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
all "material" or similar materiality type qualifications contained in the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_ (Organization,
Good Standing and Other Matters; Subsidiaries), _3.5_ (No Conflict; Required
Filings and Consents), _3.6_ (Financial Statements; Absence of Undisclosed
Liabilities; Indebtedness), _3.8_ (Absence of Certain Changes and Events),
_3.9_ (Necessary Property and Transfer of Assets), _3.15_ (Tax Matters),
_3.16(a)_ (Material Contracts), and _3.22_ (Customers and Suppliers) and other
than "material" or similar materiality type qualifications contained in the
definitions of "Material Contract" and "Permitted Liens") shall be ignored and
not given any effect for the indemnification provisions of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, for purposes of (i) determining the amount of
any Losses incurred with respect to the indemnification provisions hereof,
(ii) determining whether or not a breach of a representation or warranty
has occurred and (iii) determining whether the thresholds in _Section
10.5(a)_ have been surpassed.

(d) Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate its
respective Indemnified Losses upon the occurrence of any event or condition
that would reasonably be expected to result in Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder. In addition, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
Securityholders shall not have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement to the extent that the applicable Loss relates to action taken by or
on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party after the Closing.

(e) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Purchaser or its representative, of the Company or otherwise, shall in any
way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for any breach of
representation, warranty or covenant of which Purchaser had actual Knowledge
at or prior to the Closing.

 

(f) The amount of any Indemnified Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this _Article 10_ shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered or
recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise
with respect to such Indemnified Losses and (ii) the amount of any Tax benefit
actually recognized in cash in the year of such Indemnified Loss or the
immediately subsequent year by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
Indemnified Loss or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party
shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person in respect of any claims
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any
punitive damages (other than punitive damages required to be paid to a third
party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim), or for any damages

 



57  (other than damages required to be paid to a third party pursuant to a
Third-Party Claim) that are not recoverable in a claim for breach of contract
under the laws of the State of Delaware. 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the
limited circumstances expressly provided in this _Section 10.5(h)_ and
_Section 10.6_ and with respect to the Fundamental Representations, recovery
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any claims against the
Securityholders, or otherwise, arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, or any right
to indemnification under _Section 10.2(d)_, and on the date that the amount
of cash in the Escrow Account attributable to the Indemnity Escrow Amount is
reduced to zero, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no further
rights to indemnification under this _Article 10_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that (i) the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any Indemnified Losses
relating to the breach by any Securityholder of its respective representations
and warranties contained in _Article 4_ or its Letter of Transmittal or US
Option Surrender Form, as applicable, and (ii) all indemnification claims in
respect of Indemnified Losses of the type described in the preceding clause
(i) shall be made directly against the applicable Securityholder and not
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event
that any Indemnified Losses of the type described in the preceding clause (i)
have not been paid in full at any time that funds are to be released from the
Escrow Account to one or more Securityholders with an obligation to pay such
Indemnified Losses, funds from the Escrow Account that are attributable to
such Securityholders shall be paid to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in satisfaction of any such Indemnified Losses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the liability of each Securityholder for Indemnified Losses
relating to this Agreement, including Indemnified Losses relating to any
breach by such Securityholder its respective representations and warranties
contained in _Article 4_ or its Letter of Transmittal or US Option Surrender
Form, as applicable, shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate
payment received by such Securityholder at the Closing and any available
funds in the Escrow Account attributable to such Securityholder.

10.6 _Exclusive Remedies_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the indemnification rights set forth in this
_Article 10_ , all of which are subject to the terms, limitations, and
restrictions of this _Article 10_ , shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
after Closing for any and all claims arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including claims based on
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement under
this Agreement, except that the foregoing shall not apply to any remedies for
monetary damages (i) that an Indemnified Party may have for the actual,
knowing and intentional fraud of any of the Persons listed on _Schedule 10.6_
with respect to a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
(provided that no such claim for fraud may be brought following the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date) or (ii) that an Indemnified Party may
have against a Securityholder who is not a Person listed on _Schedule 10.6_
for such Securityholders actual, knowing and intentional fraud (it being
understood and agreed that any claim described in this clause (ii) shall be
made directly against the applicable Securityholder and not from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount; _provided_ that in the event that any Losses with
respect to such claim have not been paid in full at any time that funds are to
be released from the Escrow Account to such Securityholder, funds from the
Escrow Account that are attributable to such Securityholder shall be paid to
the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Parties in satisfaction of such Losses),
and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies,
entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties to
the fullest extent

 



58  permitted by Law. The provisions of this _Section 10.6_ and the limited
remedies provided in _Section 2.12_, _Article 10_ and _Section 12.14_ were
specifically bargained for by the parties hereto and were taken into account
by the parties hereto in arriving at the Enterprise Value and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The Company and the Securityholders have
specifically relied upon the provisions of this _Section 10.6_ and the
limited remedies provided in _Section 2.12_, _Article 10_ and _Section
12.14_ in agreeing to the Enterprise Value and the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. 

ARTICLE 11

TERMINATION

11.1 _Events of Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual consent of Purchaser and the Company;

 

(b) by written notice from Purchaser to the Company, if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by the Company in
this Agreement, such that the conditions in _Sections 9.1_ or _9.2_ are not
capable of being satisfied and which has not been cured by the Company within
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written notice from
Purchaser requesting such breach to be cured; _provided_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall not be
available to Purchaser if the failure of Purchaser to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted
in, such breach;

(c) by written notice from the Company to Purchaser, if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by Purchaser in this
Agreement, such that the conditions in _Sections 9.1_ or _9.3_ are not capable
of being satisfied and which has not been cured by Purchaser within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of written notice from the Company requesting such
breach to be cured; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)_ shall not be available to the Company if
the failure of the Company to fulfill any of its obligations under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such breach;

(d) by written notice from either the Company or Purchaser to the other, if
any Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Order or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; or

(e) by written notice from Purchaser or the Company to the other, to the
extent that the Closing Date has not occurred on or prior to March 31, 2012
(the " _Termination Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , (i) either Purchaser
or the Company shall have the option to extend the Termination Date for one
additional period not to exceed sixty (60) days if all other conditions to
consummation of the Closing are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied
and the sole reason that the Closing has not been consummated by such date is
that the condition set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ has not been satisfied and
Purchaser or the Company are still attempting to satisfy such condition, and
(ii) that the party exercising its right to so terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _11.1(e)_ shall not have been responsible for such failure of
the Closing to occur through a breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

 



59 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement shall
be terminated pursuant to _Section 11.1_, all further obligations of the
parties hereto under this Agreement (other than pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Article 12_ of this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect) shall terminate without further liability
or obligation to the other parties hereunder; _provided_ , that the term of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by the termination of this
Agreement, shall survive any such termination and be automatically extended
until such date that is two (2) years following the date of termination of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this _Section 11.2_
shall relieve any party hereto from liability, whether at Law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, for its willful and intentional breach of this
Agreement prior to the effective date of termination. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "willful and intentional" breach means a material breach that is
a consequence of an act knowingly undertaken by the breaching party with the
intent of causing a breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

12.1 _Updates to Schedules_. The Company may (but shall not be required to),
from time to time prior to or on the Closing Date, by notice in accordance
with this Agreement, supplement or amend the Schedules hereto, with respect to
any matter occurring after the date hereof which would constitute a breach of
any representation or warranty herein. Any such supplement or amendment shall
not be given effect for purposes of determining whether the conditions set
forth in _Article 9_ have been satisfied, but in the event the Closing occurs,
all such supplements and amendments shall be given effect for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach of the applicable
representations and warranties for purposes of the indemnification provisions
in _Article 10_.

12.2 _Representative_.

(a) The Representative is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered to act
as a representative by and for the benefit of the Securityholders, as the

its sole discretion, determines to be desirable;

payable to the Securityholders from the Escrow Account as described herein or
otherwise payable to the Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement, including

of this Agreement;

(iv) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests

on behalf of the Securityholders, including asserting or pursuing any Claim
against Purchaser or the Company, defending any third party Claims or Claims
by any Purchaser Indemnified Party, consenting to, compromising or settling

(v) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Securityholders or any of them
and/or the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement, instrument or
document in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such failure to act on the part of the Representative, except as otherwise

waiver of any such right or interest by the Representative or by such
Securityholders unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party
or by the Representative;

(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,

(b) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its third party expenses incurred as the
Representative. In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument,
agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or
failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Representative
hereunder (i) the Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any Securityholders by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct and (ii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice
of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the
matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of
the Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the
Representative to liability to any Securityholder.

(c) In the event that any amount is owed to the Representative, whether for
fees, expense reimbursement or indemnification, that is in excess of the
Representative Expense Amount, the Representative shall be entitled to be
reimbursed by the Securityholders, and the Securityholders agree to so
reimburse the Representative, and made whole for such shortfall. Upon written
notice from the Representative to the Securityholders as to the existence of a
shortfall, including a reasonably detailed description as to such shortfall,
each Securityholder shall promptly deliver to the Representative full payment
of his or her ratable share of the amount of such shortfall based upon such
holders pro rata portion of the Final Merger Consideration.

(d) The Purchaser and the Surviving Company shall have the right to rely upon
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative pursuant to

12.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, including the Schedules
hereto and the other documents referred to herein which form a part hereof,
and the Confidentiality Agreement, contain the entire understanding of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein and
therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
arrangements, contracts, discussions, negotiations, undertakings and
understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties with respect to
such subject matter (other than the Confidentiality Agreement). This Agreement
may be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be
waived, only by a written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement executed by the party against whom enforcement of any such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is sought. Upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and none of the
parties thereto shall have any further liability or obligation thereunder.

12.4 _No Waiver_. The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence
to any term or provision of this Agreement on any occasion shall not be
considered a waiver or deprive that

 



62  party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term
or provision or any other term or provision of this Agreement.

 

12.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Any such term or provision held invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, such term or provision is
hereby deemed modified to give effect to the original written intent of the
parties to the greatest extent consistent with being valid and enforceable
under applicable Law.

12.6 _Expenses and Obligations_. Subject to  _Section 2.12_ and _Section
2.15_, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne solely and
entirely by the party that has incurred such expenses; _provided_ , _however_
, that Purchaser shall pay any filing fees which relate to any required
governmental filing or notification, including filing fees under the HSR Act.

 

12.7 _Notices_. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under
this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given
when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) sent by
facsimile transmission (with written confirmation of delivery), or (c)
received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight
delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate
addresses and facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses
and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other
parties):

12.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by electronic transmission), each of which shall
constitute an original, and all of which taken together shall constitute one
instrument.

12.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this Agreement) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to

 



64  any choice of law principles that would require or permit the application of
the laws of another jurisdiction.

12.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the parties agrees that
any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement shall be brought
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and, by
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto hereby
irrevocably submits itself in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid court in any
legal action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement brought in the court
referred to in the preceding sentence. Each party hereto hereby consents to
process being served in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of a copy
thereof to the address set forth in _Section 12.7_ hereof below its name and
agrees that such service upon receipt shall constitute good and sufficient
service of process or notice thereof. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect
or eliminate any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Laws.

 

 _12.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT COUNSEL
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCMENT HEREOF.

12.12 _Rights Cumulative_. All rights and remedies of each of the parties
under this Agreement will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more
rights or remedies will not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy
available under this Agreement or applicable Law. 

12.13 _Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions hereof
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors by
operation of law and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. No assignment of
this Agreement may be made by any party at any time, whether or not by
operation of law, without the other parties prior written consent.

12.14 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction and that this shall include the right of the Company Group to
cause Purchaser to fully perform the terms of this Agreement to the fullest
extent permissible pursuant to this Agreement and applicable Laws and to
thereafter cause this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to
be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth
in this Agreement. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not
exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party may
have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a

 



65  remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to
post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
If any party brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended for so long as the party bringing such action is
actively seeking a court order for an injunction or injunctions or to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

12.15 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ are made for the benefit of the Persons set forth therein,
_Article 2_ is made for the benefit of the Securityholders, _Article 5_ is
also made for the benefit of the Securityholders and _Article 10_ is made for
the benefit of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Securityholder
Indemnified Parties. From and after the Closing, all of the Persons identified
in the immediately preceding sentence shall be entitled to enforce such
provisions and to avail themselves of the benefits of any remedy for any
breach of such provisions, all to the same extent as if such Persons were
parties to this Agreement.

 

12.16 _No Employee Benefit Plan Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of
this Agreement, including without limitation this  _Section 12.16_, shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any person, entity, or
organization, including without limitation employees or former employees
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or
the Securityholders, unions or other representatives of such employees or
former employees, or trustees, administrators, participants, or beneficiaries
of any Company Plan, and no provision of this Agreement shall create such
third-party beneficiary rights in any such person or organization in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any
employee benefit plan that is or may in the future be maintained by Purchaser.
No provision of this Agreement, including without limitation this _Section
12.16_, shall be deemed to amend any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan
that is or may in the future be maintained by Purchaser.

 

12.17 _Headings; Construction_. The headings of Sections in this Agreement are
provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or
interpretation. All references to " _Section_ " or " _Sections_ " or "
_Article_ " or " _Articles_ " refer to the corresponding Section or Sections
or Article or Articles of this Agreement. All words used in this Agreement
will be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require.
Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise
expressly provided, the word " _including_ " does not limit the preceding
words or terms. No party, or its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this
Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions of this Agreement, and all
language in all parts of this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party.

12.18  _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be
made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including
without limitation any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any
named party to this Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon
any theory that seeks to

 



66  impose liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for
any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates.

 

12.19 _Legal Representation_. Purchaser and the Company hereby agree, on their
own behalf and on behalf of their directors, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such
parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP (or any
successor) may represent (a) any or all of the Securityholders (the " _Seller
Group_ ") or any director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of
the Seller Group, or (b) the Representative, in each case in connection with
any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including under _Article 7_ , any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (any such representation, the " _Post-Closing Representation_ ")
notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of Purchaser and the Company
on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any
objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Purchaser and the Company
acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or not Weil, Gotshal
and Manges LLP provides legal services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date. Each of Purchaser and the Company, for itself and the
Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
all communications between the Seller Group and their counsel prior to the
Closing, including Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under this
Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of the
foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group and such
counsel and from and after the Closing, neither Purchaser, the Company, nor
any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser or the Company
or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process.
From and after the Closing, each of Purchaser and the Company, on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication between Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP
and the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Person in the Seller Group occurring
prior to the Closing in connection with any Post-Closing Representation.
