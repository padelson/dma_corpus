amounts in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material to Seller or the Buyer.&#160; To the extent applicable, any matter set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule which could, based solely on the substance of the disclosure itself, reasonably be determined to be applicable to another schedule on its face shall be deemed to be set forth in each other schedule to which it is applicable.&#160; For the avoidance of doubt, if the Seller provides any information to Buyer pursuant to this <u>Section 9.7</u> that would cause the failure of any condition precedent to Buyer&#146;s obligations set forth in <u>Sections 6.1(a)</u> through <u>6.1(c)</u> then the Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to <u>Section 8.1(a)(3)</u> without liability and the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer.</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Governing Law</u>.&#160; This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The State of New York without reference to the choice of law principles thereof.&#160; To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Seller and Buyer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive any claim to assert that the law of any other jurisdiction governs this Agreement.&#160; Seller and Buyer hereby agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and in the absence of such Federal jurisdiction, Seller and Buyer consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of The State of New York located in such district and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such
suit, action or other proceeding.&#160; In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Seller and Buyer (i) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (ii) agrees not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (iii) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other manner provided by law.&#160; THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTIES MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUIT OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.&#160; BUYER HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NONE OF SELLER, SENIOR MANAGEMENT OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SELLER WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL.&#160; FURTHER, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER RELIED ON THIS
WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO SELLER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Mutual Drafting</u>.&#160; The parties hereto have been represented by counsel who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof.&#160; As a consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of any laws or rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive their effects.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Certain Understandings</u>.&#160; Each of the parties is a sophisticated legal entity or person that was advised by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in connection with this Agreement.&#160; Accordingly, each of the parties hereby acknowledges that (i) no party has relied or will rely in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby upon any document or written or oral information previously furnished to or discovered by it or its representatives, other than this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) there are no representations or warranties by or on behalf of any party hereto or any of its respective affiliates or representatives other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (iii) the parties&#146; respective rights and obligations with respect to this Agreement
and the events giving rise thereto will be solely as set forth in this Agreement.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Specific Performance</u>.&#160; Buyer and Seller each agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.</font></p>
