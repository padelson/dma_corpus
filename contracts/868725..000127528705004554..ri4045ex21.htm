 ARTICLE II

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES; CLOSING; RELATED MATTERS

 

  Section 2.1. _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller shall sell, convey, transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer
shall purchase, acquire and accept from Seller, all right, title and interest
in and to the Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrances. The consideration to
be paid by Buyer for the Shares is set forth in _Section 2.4_ hereof.

     
  

  Section 2.2. _Closing; Delivery of the Shares_. The Closing
shall take place (a) at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 633 West Fifth
Street, Suite 4000, Los Angeles, CA 90071 at 10:00 a.m. on the third Business
Day following the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in
Article VI that are capable of being satisfied before Closing are fulfilled or
waived in accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other place, time or
date as Buyer and Seller may agree. At the Closing, Seller will deliver to
Buyer one or more certificates representing all of the Shares, duly endorsed
in blank or accompanied by stock powers or other instruments of transfer duly
executed in blank.

 

  Section 2.3. _Payment_. In consideration of the sale of the
Shares to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Seller
at the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller to Buyer prior to the Closing, Aggregate Cash
Consideration.

 

  Section 2.4. _Purchase Consideration_. The aggregate amount
payable by Buyer to Seller in respect of the Shares (the " _Purchase
Consideration_ ") shall consist of cash (the " _Aggregate Cash Consideration_
") in an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (a) $50,000,000, _plus_ (b) the
Estimated Working Capital subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 2.6_.

  

 Section 2.5. _Deposit_. Buyer shall engage an escrow agent and Buyer and Seller shall enter into the Escrow Agreement as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any case no later than November 11, 2005). Buyer shall deposit $2,500,000 (the " _Deposit_ ") in immediately available funds with the escrow agent within two (2) Business Days after the date the Escrow Agreement is fully executed. The Deposit will be held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, such Deposit to be applied towards the Aggregate Cash Consideration or otherwise applied or paid in the manner provided for by Article VIII.

 

  Section 2.6. _Adjustment of Aggregate Cash Consideration_.

 

  (a) Not later than 10 Business Days before the
Closing Date, Seller will provide Buyer with Sellers good faith estimate of
the Companys Closing Working Capital, based upon the accounting books and
records of the Company (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), and all
underlying documentation supporting the Estimated Working Capital. The
determination of the Estimated Working Capital will be binding on Seller and
Buyer for purposes of this _Section 2.6(a)_ and will be used to determine the
amount of the Aggregate Cash Consideration payable to Seller at the Closing.
The Estimated Working Capital Amount must be equal to or greater than zero. In
the event that the Estimated Working Capital Amount is less than zero, Seller
shall contribute an amount of cash to the Company necessary to cause the
Estimated Working Capital Amount to equal zero.

 

  (b) As promptly as practicable, but no later
than 45 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer the Closing Statement (as defined below) and a certificate
based on such Closing Statement setting forth Sellers calculation of Closing
Working Capital. The closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") shall
present the Net Working Capital as of the end of business on the Closing Date
(" _Closing Working Capital_ ").

      
  

  " _Net Working Capital_ " means the amount equal to the Companys cash,
_plus_ inventory (including, without limitation, supplies, parts, unamortized
catalyst expenditures and recovered precious metals), _plus_ trade receivables
(other than trade receivables owing from Seller or its Affiliates), _minus_
the accounts payable _minus_ accrued liabilities (excluding all current and
deferred Taxes based on the Companys income) of the Company, in each case as
determined in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles. A sample
calculation of Net Working Capital is attached hereto as _Annex A_.

 

  (c) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers
calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_
, Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a
notice to Seller disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Buyers
calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall (i) specify
those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees, and Buyer shall be deemed
to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.6(b)_ and (ii) only include disagreements based on mathematical
errors or Sellers failure to follow Applicable Accounting Principles in its
calculation of Closing Working Capital.

 

  (d) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_ , Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15
days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
amount of Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than the
amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section
2.6(b)_ nor more than the amount thereof shown in Buyers calculation
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_. If during such period, Buyer and
Seller are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter
cause PricewaterhouseCoopers (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to review this
Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating
Closing Working Capital. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee
shall consider only (i) those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and
Buyers calculation of Closing Working Capital as to which Buyer has disagreed
and (ii) disagreements based on mathematical errors or Sellers failure to
follow Applicable Accounting Principles in its calculation of Closing Working
Capital. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly
as practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days from the date of
engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth such
calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The
cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

 (e) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective representatives, and Buyer shall cause the Company, to cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of the review referred to in this _Section 2.6_ , including, without limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

 

  (f) If Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated
Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in the manner as provided in
_Section 2.6(g)_ , the amount by which Final Working Capital so exceeds
Estimated Working Capital as an adjustment to the Purchase Consideration and,
if Estimated Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Seller shall pay
to Buyer the amount by which Estimated Working Capital so exceeds Final
Working Capital as an adjustment to the Purchase Consideration.

     
  

  " _Final Working Capital_ " means Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in
Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to _Section
2.6(c)_ ; or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed
by Buyer and Seller pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referees calculation delivered pursuant
to _Section 2.6(d)_.

 

  (g) Any payment pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_
shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within 3 Business Days
after Final Working Capital has been determined by wire transfer by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, of immediately available funds to the account of
such other party as may be designated in writing by such other party.

  (a) _338(h)(10) Election_. Seller and Buyer
shall jointly make (or cause to be made), and will take any and all action
necessary to effect, a timely election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any comparable elections under state and local income Tax law) with
respect to the Company (the " _Election_ "). Buyer and Seller shall execute
and submit Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 at Closing pursuant to _Section

deemed paid for the assets of the Company. The Forms shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 338 of the Code and any applicable Treasury
Regulations (or, if applicable, comparable provisions of state and local
income tax law). The Buyer shall have 30 days following the receipt of the
Forms from the Seller to notify the Seller in writing whether or not the Buyer
accepts the Forms as prepared by the Seller. If the Buyer notifies the Seller

detail in the written notice its reasons for non-acceptance and specify the
adjustments, which, in its opinion, should be made. The Seller and the Buyer
shall use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the adjustments, if
any, to be made to the Forms. If the Seller and the Buyer do not reach
agreement within 25 days after the Seller receives the Buyers notice of non-
acceptance, the matter shall be referred to and determined by the Accounting
Referee as promptly as feasible and the determination shall be binding on both
the Buyer and the Seller.

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (ii) The Forms, as prepared and agreed to pursuant to
this Section 5.7, shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Buyer and the
Seller. Neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall, or shall permit any of their
Affiliates to, take any action to modify any of the Forms or reports
(including any corrections, amendments, or supplements thereto) that are
required for the making of the Election after its execution or to modify or
revoke the Election following the filing of the Forms without the prior
written consent of the other party. Each of the Seller and the Buyer will be
responsible for timely filing Form 8883 in a manner consistent with the Forms.
Each of the Buyer and Seller shall be responsible for filing all Forms
required by any state or local jurisdiction.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (iii) In the event that any of the Forms is disputed

shall promptly notify and consult with the other party hereto concerning
resolution of such dispute.

  
   

  (b) _Pre-Closing Taxes; Straddle Periods_.
Seller shall be responsible for paying " _Pre-Closing Taxes_ ," which shall be
defined as all Taxes due with respect to any Tax period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of a
Straddle Period, as determined in accordance with this _Section 5.7(b)_ ,
except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in Net Working Capital.
Unless prohibited by applicable law, Buyer, Seller and the Company shall cause
the taxable year of the Company to close on the Closing Date. In the case of
any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income,
receipts or expenditures of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Company for
a Straddle

      
  

 Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period in which the Straddle Period
occurs multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the total number of days in the Straddle Period. For avoidance of doubt,
any Taxes realized on or before the Closing as a result of the Election (the "
_338 Taxes_ ") or other Taxes on income or gain realized on or before the
Closing as a result of the Companys departure from the Group shall be Pre-
Closing Taxes.

 

  (c) _Preparation of Pre-Closing Period
Returns_. The Company shall continue to be included for all taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing in the consolidated federal income Tax Return
for the affiliated group of which Seller is the common parent (the " _Group_
") and any required state or local consolidated, combined or unitary income or
franchise Tax Returns that include the Company (all such Tax Returns including
taxable periods of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date are
hereinafter referred to as " _Pre-Closing Consolidated Returns_ "). Seller
shall prepare and file all Pre-Closing Consolidated Returns and all other Tax
Returns for a period that ends on or before the Closing Date (collectively, "
_Pre-Closing Period Returns_ "). Seller shall pay all Taxes and be entitled
to all refunds and credits attributable to all Pre-Closing Period Returns.

 

  (d) _Preparation of Straddle Period Returns_.
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all
Returns of the Company for any Straddle Period (each a " _Straddle Period
Return_ "). Buyer shall provide a copy of each such Straddle Period Return to
Seller for its approval not later than 45 days prior to the deadline for
filing each such Tax Return. Concurrently with the provision to the Seller of
any Straddle Period Return (including any draft Straddle Period Return), Buyer
shall provide a computation of the Pre-Closing Taxes reflected in any such
Straddle Period Return (such computation, the " _Statement_ "). If Seller
disagrees with the allocation in the Statement or with such Straddle Period
Return, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within 15
days of receipt of the Statement, and Seller and Buyer shall consult and
attempt to resolve in good faith the disagreement. In the event that Seller
and Buyer are unable to resolve the disagreement within 10 days, Seller and
Buyer shall submit the matter to the Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute
as promptly as possible.

  

 (e) _Tax Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, Seller shall submit to Buyer blank tax return workpaper packages reasonably necessary for Seller to prepare any Pre-Closing Consolidated Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared completely and accurately all information that Seller shall reasonably request in such workpaper packages and shall submit to Seller such packages within the later of 60 days after Buyers receipt thereof or 45 days after the close of the taxable period to which a workpaper package relates. Each party shall cooperate with the other in connection with any Tax filing, investigation, audit or other proceeding. Buyer and Seller shall (i) preserve and cause to be preserved all information, returns, books, records and documents relating to any liabilities for Taxes of the Company with respect to a taxable period until the later of sixty 60 days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation and extensions thereof, or the conclusion of all litigation with respect to Taxes for such period and (ii) give reasonable written notice to the other party prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such information, returns, books, records or documents and, if the other party so requests, allow party to take possession of such information, returns, books, records or documents. Buyer shall make available to Seller (and to Sellers accountants and attorneys) any and all books and records and other documents and information in its possession or control related to the Company reasonably requested by Seller to prepare Pre-Closing Consolidated Returns or to deal with audits related to pre-Closing periods.

     
  

  (f) _Carrybacks_. To the extent permitted by
law, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
not to, carry back any tax attribute to a period ending on or before the
Closing Date.

  

 (g) Buyer shall not cause or permit Company to take any extraordinary action on the Closing Date (other than the Election), and if it does, Buyer shall be responsible for any Tax costs resulting from such action. 

 

  Section 5.8. _Employee Matters_.

 

  (a) At the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Company to offer continued employment to all employees employed by the Company
immediately prior to the Closing Date (collectively, "Employees"), _provided_

the Company shall have the same right to terminate the employment of any
Employee following the Closing and to adopt such compensation, incentive and
benefit programs as it shall determine in its sole judgment as it has on the
date hereof.

 

  (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall maintain for all Employees credit for any service with the Company
earned prior to the Closing Date:

  |  

 (ii)

  |

or maintained by the Company on or after the Closing Date (the " _Buyer

condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under

covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Employee (or
covered dependent thereof) for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible
provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable Buyer Benefit Plan.
Buyer will, or will cause the Company to, maintain Buyer Benefit Plans for the
benefit of Non-Union Employees and their dependents that are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to the employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements that the Buyer provides to its similarly situated employees,
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, collective bargaining agreements
are deemed to not be substantially similar plans, programs or arrangements for
the benefit of Non-Union Employees and their dependants. Subject to _Section
5.8(h)_ , Buyers health benefit plan shall be responsible for all benefits
incurred on and after the Closing Date by eligible Employees and their covered
dependents. Sellers health plan shall be responsible for all benefits
incurred prior to the Closing Date by eligible Employees and their covered
dependants as determined under the terms of Sellers plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, costs and expenses (be they administrative, direct payment of
expenses or otherwise) of Seller under or in connection with the operation of
the preceding sentence for benefits rendered on or after the Closing Date for
eligible Employees and their covered dependents as of the Closing Date shall
be for the account of Buyer, which shall reimburse Seller therefor up to an
amount no greater than $325,000. Such reimbursement shall occur within twenty
(20) days after receipt of a reasonably detailed notice thereof, provided that
the date that the underlying benefits were rendered is reasonably
ascertainable.

      
  

  (c) Notwithstanding any limitation in _Sections
5.8(a)_ or _5.8(b)_ above, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, honor
any collective bargaining agreements, including without limitation any
amendments, addenda or memoranda of understanding relating or entered into in
connection therewith, by which the Company is bound on the date hereof, with
such changes therein as may be agreed to in the Ordinary Course of Business,
or with Buyers consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), between
the date hereof and Closing. Employees whose terms and conditions of
employment are subject to any such collective bargaining agreements are
hereinafter referred to as " _Union Employees_." All other Employees are
referred to as " _Non-Union Employees_."

 

  (d) _401(k)/Savings Plans_.

 

  _Non-Union Employees_

       

 

  |  

  (i) As soon as practicable, but in any event within
90 days, following Closing, Buyer will establish, or designate, a savings plan
qualified under Code Section 401(a) and including a cash or deferred feature
under Code Section 401(k) and a related trust thereunder which shall be exempt
under Code Section 501(a) (collectively " _Buyer s Savings Plan_") for the
benefit of Non-Union Employees. Buyers Savings Plan may be sponsored by Buyer
or any other entity controlled, within the meaning of Code Section 414, by
Buyer.

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

  (ii) Buyer shall allow Non-Union Employees to
participate in the Buyers Savings Plan on terms and conditions substantially
similar to its similarly situated employees, with service credit as provided
under _Section 5.8(b)_ above.

  
     

 

  |  

 

  
     

 

  |  

   (iii) All Non-Union Employees will fully vest in
their accounts held under Sellers savings plan qualified under Code Section
401(a) and including a cash or deferred feature under Code Section 401(k) ("
_Seller s 401(k) Plan_") as of the Closing Date. Buyer will cause the
Buyers Savings Plan to accept the rollover, by direct or indirect rollover,
as selected by each Non-Union Employee, of that portion of the Non-Union
Employees accounts in Sellers 401(k) Plan that constitutes an
"eligible rollover distribution" as that term is defined by Section 402(c)(4)
of the Code, provided that at the time a Non-Union Employee elects such a
rollover that Non-Union Employee is employed by the Buyer or an employer
under Buyers control within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code. Any such
rollover will be effected in cash and, as applicable, any notes evidencing
loans from the Sellers 401(k) Plan to the Non-Union Employee electing
such rollover. Buyer and Seller will, and will cause the trustees of
their respective 401(k) plans to, cooperate with each other with respect to
the rollover of the eligible rollover distribution portions of the Non-
Union Employees account balances in the Sellers 401(k) Plan to the Buyers
Savings Plan.

  (f) _Severance Benefits_. Buyer will, and will
cause the Company to pay severance benefits to any Employee terminated with
the one year period following closing, that are at least equal to the
severance benefits to which such Employee would be entitled under the terms of
the applicable severance plan on the date hereof.

 

  (g) _WARN Act_. The Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any Claim arising under the Worker Adjustment Retraining
Notification Act, or any equivalent state or local statute or ordinance
requiring the provision of notices to Employees affected by a plant closing,
mass layoff, or the like (collectively, the " _WARN Act_ "), relating to or
arising from the failure to retain in employment, or the termination or layoff
of any Employees or any other employment decision made by Buyer on or after
the Closing Date.

  

 (h) _COBRA and Disability Benefits_. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to maintain a group health plan and disability plans. Therefore, Seller agrees and covenants that it shall be responsible for providing (i) continuing short-term and long-term disability benefits under the terms of its plans for any employee or former employee of the Company who is entitled to payments of such benefits as of the Closing Date and (ii) continuation coverage as required by COBRA to those employees of the Company and any other qualified beneficiaries under COBRA with respect to such employees who have a COBRA qualifying event prior to or as of the Closing Date.

which have been the subject of a Claims Notice to the Indemnifying Party
before the termination of the applicable Survival Period.

     
  

  Section 7.2. _Indemnification_.

 

  (a) From and after the Closing Date and subject
to Article VII, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company) against and in respect of any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses (" _Losses_ "), resulting or arising from
or otherwise relating to (i) any breaches of Sellers representations and
warranties set forth in Article III of this Agreement, (ii) any nonfulfillment
of or failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of Seller set forth in
this Agreement or (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes as set forth in _Section 5.7_
and Taxes resulting from the Company being severally liable for any Taxes of
the Group or any other consolidated group of which the Company was a member
prior to the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations §1.1502-6 or any
analogous state, local or foreign Tax provision, any Tax imposed upon or
relating to the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise as a result of a pre-Closing action of the Company, any Tax arising
directly or indirectly from a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty set forth in _Section 3.15_ , any Section 338 Tax, or (iv) any Losses
incurred by the Company solely by reason of the joint and several liability
provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to (1) any employee pension

including any Multiemployer Plan maintained or contributed to by any ERISA
Affiliate (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (2) non-compliance
by any ERISA Affiliate (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) with the
notice and benefit continuation requirements of COBRA.

  

 (b) From and after the Closing Date and subject to Article VII, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against and in respect of any and all Losses resulting or arising from or otherwise relating to (i) any breaches of Buyers representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or (ii) any nonfulfillment of or failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of Buyer set forth in this Agreement.

 

  (c) Any payments pursuant to this Article VII
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Consideration.

 

  (d) Payment in full of any amount due under
_Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ shall be made to the Buyer in immediately available
funds at least five Business Days before the date for payment of the Taxes to
which such payment relates is due. The Tax indemnities contained in _Section
7.2(a)(iii)_ shall not be subject to any threshold or other limitations
contained in this Agreement.

 

  Section 7.3. _Method of Asserting Claims, Etc_. The
obligations and Liabilities of any party hereto against which indemnification
is sought hereunder with respect to claims resulting from the assertion of
liability by third parties shall be subject to this _Section 7.3_.

 

  (a) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified
Party of notice of any demand or claim or the commencement of any action,
proceeding or investigation (an " _Asserted Liability_ ") that could
reasonably be expected to result in Losses, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give written notice thereof (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to the party
obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)_. Each Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail and shall, to the extent reasonably possible, indicate the
amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Losses that have been or may be
suffered by the Indemnified Party. The rights of any Indemnified Party to be
indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by its failure to give,
or its failure to timely give, a Claims Notice with respect thereto unless,
and if so, only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby.

      
  

  (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days
of receipt of a Claims Notice from the Indemnified Party to assume the defense
of such Asserted Liability, using counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend against, negotiate or settle with any Asserted Liability
which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided or contests its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such Losses under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnified Party defends
any Asserted Liability, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for the Losses of defending such Asserted Liability upon
submission of periodic bills. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the
defense of any Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party may participate, at
his or its own expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability; _provided_
, _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in
the written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party that would make such separate representation required under applicable
standards of professional responsibility; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such
counsel for all indemnified parties in connection therewith. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Asserted Liability. Subject to
the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such
Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to clause (c) below,
cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or
defense against, such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend any claim, the Indemnified Party shall, make available to the
Indemnifying Party any books, records or other documents within its control,
and the reasonable assistance of its employees, for which the Indemnifying
Party shall be obliged to reimburse the Indemnified Party the reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses of making them available.

  

 (c) If any Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of an Asserted Liability in accordance with the terms hereof, he, she or it shall have the right to consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, or otherwise settle such Asserted Liability without the consent of the Indemnified Party if (i) the settlement involves solely monetary damages, (ii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing to the Indemnified Party that, as between the two, the Indemnifying Party is solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the claim and (iii) the Indemnified Party receives an unconditional release of liability. If the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, or otherwise settle such Asserted Liability only upon receipt of the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnified Party does not give such consent, the Indemnifying Party shall resume the diligent defense of the Asserted Liability. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Asserted Liability in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, or otherwise settle such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     
  

  (d) After any final decision, judgment or award
shall have been rendered by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement
shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an
Asserted Liability hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying
Party shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to the
Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds within 10
Business Days after the date of such notice.

  

 Section 7.4. _Environmental Procedures_. Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this Agreement, Seller shall have the right to direct, manage and control, and take such actions as are reasonably necessary in connection with, any Remediation or defense or other resolution of any claim, event or condition subject to indemnification under or arising from the breaches of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in under _Section 3.18_ , and Buyer shall provide Seller with access to the Company property reasonably necessary for Seller to exercise their rights under this _Section 7.4_. Sellers obligations to indemnify for any Environmental Liability pursuant to this Article VII or to conduct any Remediation shall be deemed satisfied so long as the remedy (i) complies with the minimum and least stringent standards enforceable under applicable Environmental Laws, and (ii) is approved or authorized by Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over such matters, where such approval or authorization is required by applicable Environmental Laws (the " _Remediation Standard_ "). Seller may use the most commercially reasonable and cost-effective method of achieving the Remediation Standard, including the use of commercial, industrial and/or other forms of non-residential cleanup criteria and the use of environmental land use restrictions or similar institutional controls. Buyer agrees that, if such environmental land use restrictions or similar institutional controls are approved or authorized by Governmental Authorities or Environmental Laws, as applicable, Buyer will execute any required documents and will cooperate with Seller in the recording, on the applicable land records, of such environmental land use restrictions or similar controls; provided, however, such land use restrictions or similar institutional controls do not render the Company Properties unsuitable for use as such Company Properties were used immediately prior to and up to the Closing.

 

  Section 7.5. _Indemnification Amounts/Seller_. Except for
Losses arising from breach of _Sections 3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.15_ and _3.22_ ,
Seller shall not have liability for Sellers breach of representations and
warranties under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ and for breach of any of the Interim
Covenants until the aggregate amount of Buyers Losses attributable to
indemnification claims under such section exceeds $625,000 (the " _Basket
Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall be liable only for the
amount by which all Losses exceed the Basket Amount; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no individual claim for a breach of a representation or warranty under
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or a breach of any of the Interim Covenants may be made
under _Section 7.2_ unless such claim is in an amount of $25,000 or greater.

      
  

 The maximum liability of Seller for Losses as a result of breaches of
representations and warranties under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ and for breach of any
of the Interim Covenants shall not exceed $6,125,000; provided that this
limitation shall not apply to Losses arising from a breach of the
representations made in _Sections 3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.15_ and _3.22_ and will
not apply to breaches of any covenant or agreement (other than the Interim
Covenants), including any covenant or agreement in Article II or V (other than
the Interim Covenants).

 

  Section 7.6. _Indemnification Amounts/Buyer_. Except for
Losses arising from breach of _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.4_ , Buyer shall
not have liability for Buyers breach of representations and warranties under
_Section 7.2(b)(i)_ and for breach of any of the Interim Covenants until the
aggregate amount of Sellers Losses attributable to indemnification claims
under such section exceeds the Basket Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Buyer shall be liable only for the amount by which all Losses exceed the
Basket Amount.

 

  Section 7.7. _Losses Net of Insurance, Etc_. The amount of
any Loss for which indemnification is provided under _Section 7.2_ shall be
net of (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, (ii) any
insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement actually
recovered in respect of such Loss (each source named in clauses (i) and (ii),
a " _Collateral Source_ "), (iii) an amount equal to the actual Tax benefit
realized with respect to such Loss and (iv) any specific accruals or reserves
(or overstatement of liabilities in respect of actual liability) included in
the Closing Statement. Subject to the foregoing, the parties shall take and
shall cause their Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps to (i)
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto and (ii) seek recovery from all
Collateral Sources. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment
required under _Section 7.2_ is determined after payment by the Indemnifying
Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the
Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this Article VII had
such determination been made at the time of such payment.

  

 Section 7.8. _Sole Remedy/Waiver_.

 

  (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be Buyers sole and exclusive
remedy vis-a-vis Seller with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

full force and effect) shall forthwith become void and have no effect, except
that Buyer, the Company or Seller, as the case may be, may have liability to
the other parties if the basis of the termination is a willful and material
breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, and all rights and remedies, at law or
in equity, of the nonbreaching parties under this Agreement shall in that
instance be preserved.

 

  (b) The Deposit shall be returned to the Buyer,
provided that, if (i) the Seller shall be eligible to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the final sentence of _Section 8.1(a)_ and (ii) either the
Seller or the Buyer shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(4)_ in circumstances where the Buyer shall have failed to obtain
Financing Arrangements sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein on the Drop Dead Date, the listing approval required to satisfy
_Section 6.1(j)_ by the Drop Dead Date or the stockholder approval required to
satisfy _Section 6.1(k)_ by the Drop Dead Date, the Buyer shall receive the
Deposit as a break fee, which shall be paid by release of the Deposit to
Seller pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and Seller will take
all action thereunder necessary to ensure such payment is promptly made.

      
  

  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the delivery of the Deposit shall also
be the sole remedy for any breaches by Buyer under this Agreement related to
the failure of Buyer to obtain such Financing Arrangements or stockholder
approval. Receipt of the Deposit by the Seller shall not limit any other right
or remedy existing in the Sellers favor with respect breaches by Buyer under
this Agreement that are unrelated to the failure by Buyer to obtain the
Financing Arrangements or stockholder approval. For purposes of this _Section
8.2(b)_ , the Buyer shall be deemed to have obtained Financing Arrangements
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated herein if the Buyer or
Rentech, Inc. shall have entered into definitive agreements with debt and/or
equity investors to provide sufficient financing for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and the conditions to the obligations of
such investors to fund under such definitive agreements could reasonably be
satisfied (assuming the closing of the transactions contemplated herein) on
the Drop Dead Date.

 

 ARTICLE IX

 

 MISCELLANEOUS

 

  Section 9.1. _Amendments; Extension; Waiver_. (a) Subject to
compliance with Applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, altered,
modified or waived by written instrument executed by each of the parties
hereto, or in the case of waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to
be effective.

 

  (b) No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

  

 (c) To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (i) no waiver that may be given by a party shall be applicable except in the specific instance for which it was given and (ii) no notice to or demand on one party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand.

 

  Section 9.2. _Entire Agreement_.

 

  (a) The schedules and exhibits to this
Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral

this Agreement.

 

  (b) This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto, except as provided
herein, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

     
  

  Section 9.3. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  Section 9.6. _Binding Effect; Persons Benefiting; No
Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the parties hereto and the respective successors and permitted assigns of the
parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, nothing in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns any right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any part hereof.
Without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto, this
Agreement and the rights hereunder may not be assigned by any of the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may collaterally assign this
Agreement and any or all rights hereunder to any lender to Buyer providing
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_
, _further_ , that Buyer may assign this Agreement and any or all rights
hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Buyer shall in each such case remain liable for its obligations under this
Agreement. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Buyer shall also apply to such assignee unless the context
otherwise requires.

 

  Section 9.7. _Disclosure Schedules_. Seller may provide
information to Buyer with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered which, if existing or known at date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided,
that no such information shall constitute an amendment of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or of any statement, representation or warranty in this
Agreement; provided, further, that if Buyer elects to proceed with the
Closing, the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed amended to include
such information effective upon the Closing and Buyer shall be precluded from
making any claim for damages under Article VII hereof based on the Company
Disclosure Schedule or any representation or warranty of Seller that has been
so supplemented. Inclusion of information or references to dollar amounts in
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that
such information is material to Seller or the Buyer. To the extent applicable,
any matter set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule which could, based
solely on the substance of the disclosure itself, reasonably be determined to
be applicable to another schedule on its face shall be deemed to be set forth
in each other schedule to which it is applicable. For the avoidance of doubt,
if the Seller provides any information to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 9.7_
that would cause the failure of any condition precedent to Buyers obligations
set forth in _Sections 6.1(a)_ through _6.1(c)_ then the Buyer may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(3)_ without liability and the
Deposit shall be returned to Buyer.

  

 Section 9.8. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, it being understood that all of the parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     
  

  Section 9.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The State of New York
without reference to the choice of law principles thereof. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, Seller and Buyer hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waive any claim to assert that the law of any other
jurisdiction governs this Agreement. Seller and Buyer hereby agree and consent
to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, and in the absence of such
Federal jurisdiction, Seller and Buyer consent to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court of The State of New York located in such district and
hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or subject matter
jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such suit, action or
other proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Seller and Buyer
(i) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (ii) agrees not to commence any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transactions contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (iii)
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTIES MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUIT OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. BUYER HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NONE OF
SELLER, SENIOR MANAGEMENT OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SELLER WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO
JURY TRIAL. FURTHER, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER RELIED ON THIS WAIVER OF
RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO SELLER TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT.

  

 Section 9.10. _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto have been represented by counsel who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do not intend that the presumptions of any laws or rules relating to the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause should be applied to this Agreement and therefore waive their effects.

 

  Section 9.11. _Certain Understandings_. Each of the parties
is a sophisticated legal entity or person that was advised by experienced
counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in connection
with this Agreement. Accordingly, each of the parties hereby acknowledges that
(i) no party has relied or will rely in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby upon any document or written or oral
information previously furnished to or discovered by it or its
representatives, other than this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedule), (ii) there are no representations or warranties by or on behalf of
any party hereto or any of its respective affiliates or representatives other
than those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (iii) the parties
respective rights and obligations with respect to this Agreement and the
events giving rise thereto will be solely as set forth in this Agreement.

 

  Section 9.12. _Specific Performance_. Buyer and Seller each
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the
terms hereof and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

     
  

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement
to be executed as of the date first above written.
