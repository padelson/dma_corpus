Knowledge of EQT Gathering and EQT Gathering Holdings, there is currently no
need to undertake renovations, repairs or construction work at any portion of
the material Real Property Assets that constitute Operational Assets. EQT

for the operation of the Transferred Assets in substantially the same manner
as currently being conducted.

 



 

(b) The Operational Assets and any Non-Operational Assets that are necessary

by EQT Gathering, AVC and Rager in the ordinary course of business and, except

reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The
Operational Assets and the Rager Lease (as applicable) are adequate to conduct
EQT Gatherings, AVCs and Ragers gas gathering, transportation and storage
businesses substantially in accordance with past practice, in compliance with
any material Applicable Law or requirements of a Governmental Authority.

Assets are all those necessary for the operation of the Business as it is
currently conducted. Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, with or without
notice or lapse of time, result in, or give any other Person the right or
option to cause or declare, a breach or termination of, or cancellation or
reduction in, rights of EQT Gathering, AVC or Rager under any contract
providing for the license of any Intellectual Property to EQT Gathering, AVC
or Rager, except for any such terminations, cancellations or reductions that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect. There is no Intellectual Property-related action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, notice or complaint pending or threatened by any third
party before any court or tribunal (including, without limitation, the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere in the
world) relating to EQT Gathering, AVC, Rager or their respective operations,
nor has any claim or demand been made by any third party that alleges any
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of

Holdings agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to

Subject Interests as is reasonably requested by EQM, EQT Gathering Holdings,
EQT Gathering or any Affiliate for the filing of any Tax Returns, for the
preparation of any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any Tax claim.
The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. Any
information obtained under this _Section 5.3_ shall be held confidential by
the receiving party in the same manner as it holds confidential its own
similar information, except (i) as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit
or other proceeding or (ii) with the consent of EQM, EQT Gathering and EQT
Gathering Holdings.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp, duties,
recording, and similar Taxes (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Transactions and the transfer of Consideration pursuant
thereto shall be (1) borne equally by EQM and EQT Gathering with respect to
the Asset Sale and (2) borne equally by EQM and EQT Gathering Holdings with
respect to the AVC Sale and Rager Sale. EQM, EQT Gathering and EQT Gathering
Holdings shall cooperate in causing the filing of all necessary Tax Returns

shall indemnify EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings, as applicable, for,
all Taxes related to the Transferred Assets or Subject Interests attributable

"). In the case of any Taxes related to the Transferred Assets or Subject
Interests that are payable for any taxable period that begins before and ends
after the Cut-off Date (any " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Taxes
attributable to the period of time prior to the Cut-off Date (a) in the case
of any property, ad valorem, or similar Taxes, shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending prior to the
Cut-off Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of all other Taxes, shall be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable as computed on an interim closing-of-the-

day prior to the Cut-off Date. EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings, as
applicable, shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify EQM for, all Taxes

Asset Sale and (ii) to EQT Gathering Holdings with respect to matters
concerning the Subject Interests, the AVC Assets, the Rager Assets, the AVC
Sale and the Rager Sale.

 



 

(d) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided,

the appropriate Governmental Authority of all Taxes with respect to any EQT
Gathering Period (and shall file all such Tax Returns), and EQM shall handle

any Straddle Period or EQM Period (and shall file all such Tax Returns). EQT
Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings, as applicable, shall deliver to EQM

Authority shall be prepared and filed consistently with any such agreed upon
allocation. The parties agree that, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
they will each properly prepare and timely file Form 8594 in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code.

 



 

(f) _Like-Kind Exchange_. Any party to this Agreement may elect to structure
this transaction as a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to any or all of the
Transferred Assets (a " _Like-Kind Exchange_ ") at any time prior to the
Closing Date. In order to effect a Like-Kind Exchange, a non-electing party
shall cooperate and do all acts as may be reasonably required or requested by
the party electing for a Like-Kind Exchange with regard to effecting such
Like-Kind Exchange, including, but not limited to, permitting such Party to
assign its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (" _QI_ ")
of such partys choice in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) or executing additional escrow instructions, documents,
agreements or instruments to effect an exchange. EQM reserves the right, at or
prior to Closing, to assign its rights or a portion thereof under this
Agreement with respect to any or all of the Transferred Assets to EQMs
Qualified Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (as that term is defined in
Revenue Procedure 2000-37) (" _QEAT_ ") in connection with effecting a Like-
Kind Exchange. EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings, as applicable, and EQM
acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial assignment of this Agreement to
a QI or QEAT shall not release either EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings,
as applicable, or EQM from, or expand, any of their respective liabilities and
obligations to each other under this Agreement. The party not participating in
the Like-Kind Exchange shall not be obligated to pay any additional costs or
incur any additional obligations in its sale or purchase, as applicable, of
the Transferred Assets if such costs are the result of the other partys Like-
Kind Exchange, and the party electing to consummate the sale as a Like-Kind
Exchange agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the other party from and
against all costs, expenses, claims, losses and liabilities, if any, resulting
from the Like-Kind Exchange.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Access to Excluded Assets_. Following the Closing, employees of

Investments and EQM shall receive any benefits of such Excluded Assets and any
other Excluded Assets that are related to the Transferred Contracts, AVC
Pipeline Contracts and Rager Storage Contracts or that are needed to carry out
the intent of the transactions contemplated hereby and the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

Section 5.5 _EQT Energy Supply, LLC Operating Agreement_. The Amended and
Restated Operating Agreement of EQT Energy Supply, LLC dated as of April 15,

amended and restated to the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ in connection with the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Reimbursement of Expansion Capital Cost Overruns_. EQM Gathering
Opco acknowledges and agrees that following the Closing it shall be obligated
under the Gas Gathering Agreement to construct the Expansions in accordance

Holdings agree to promptly reimburse EQM Gathering Opco for the amount by
which the aggregate costs of the Expansions paid by EQM Gathering Opco (i)
prior to December 31, 2018, exceeds $95,300,000 (such reimbursed amount, if
any, being the " _Interim Reimbursement_ ") and (ii) prior to December 31,
2020 (the aggregate cost as of such date being the " _Final Cost_ "), exceeds
the cumulative amount of $105,300,000; provided, that if, (i) the Final Cost
is less than $105,300,000, EQM Gathering Opco shall refund to EQT Gathering
the entirety of the Interim Reimbursement, (ii) the Final Cost is greater than
$105,300,000 but less than the sum of $105,300,000 plus the Interim
Reimbursement, EQM Gathering Opco shall refund to EQT Gathering the amount by
which the Interim Reimbursement exceeds the difference of the Final Cost less
$105,300,000 and (iii) the Final Cost is greater than or equal to the sum of
$105,300,000 plus the Interim Reimbursement, no refund of the Interim
Reimbursement is required, but the additional reimbursement in connection with
the Final Cost shall be reduced by the Interim Reimbursement already paid. If
construction of any of the Expansion is delayed past December 31, 2020 as a
result of factors not within the control of EQM Gathering Opco, the
reimbursement and refund obligations tied to such date shall be extended to
ninety (90) days after the date of completion of such Expansions. For federal
income tax purposes, EQM will report such payments, if any, as a purchase
price adjustment.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Future AVC Assignments_. EQT Gathering Holdings acknowledges and

that any such indemnification obligation with respect to an Adverse
Consequence shall survive the time at which it would otherwise expire pursuant
to this _Section 6.2(a)_ if notice of such Adverse Consequence is properly
given by the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to
the party from which indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
prior to such time.

 



 

(b) The aggregate liability of EQT Gathering and EQT Gathering Holdings under

shall not exceed the Consideration.

 



 

(c) No claims may be made against EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate dollar
amount of the Adverse Consequence suffered or incurred by the EQM Protected
Parties exceeds $250,000, after which EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings,
as applicable, shall be liable for the full amount of such claims in excess of
$250,000, subject to the limitations of _Section 6.2(b)_.

(e) In no event shall EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings be obligated to
the EQM Protected Parties under _Section 6.1(a)_ for any Adverse Consequence
to the extent (i) any insurance proceeds are realized by the EQM Protected
Parties, such correlative benefit to be net of any incremental insurance
premium that becomes due and payable by the EQM Protected Parties as a result
of such claim, or (ii) any amounts are recovered by the EQM Protected Parties
from third persons.

 



 

(f) In no event shall EQM be obligated to the EQT Gathering Protected Parties

Parties after the Effective Date for any Adverse Consequences owed by EQT

Section 6.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnified Party agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts
giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this _Article VI_, it will
provide notice thereof in writing to the Indemnifying Party, specifying the
nature of and specific basis for such claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Article VI_ to the contrary, a delay by the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this _Article VI_, except to the extent that such failure
shall have caused actual prejudice to the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend against the applicable claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control all aspects of the
defense of (and any counterclaims with respect to) any claims brought against
the Indemnified Party that are covered by the indemnification under this
_Article VI_, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, the
determination of whether to appeal any decision of any court and the
settlement of any such matter or any issues relating thereto; provided,
however, that no such settlement shall be entered into without the consent of
the Indemnified Party (with the concurrence of the

 



      
 

 



 

Conflicts Committee in the case of the EQM Protected Parties) unless it
includes a full release of the Indemnified Party from such matter or issues,
as the case may be, and does not include any admission of fault, culpability
or a failure to act, by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party with respect to all aspects of the defense of any claims covered by the
indemnification under this _Article VI_, including, without limitation, the
prompt furnishing to the Indemnifying Party of any correspondence or other
notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Party may receive, permitting the
name of the Indemnified Party to be utilized in connection with such defense,
the making available to the Indemnifying Party of any files, records or other
information of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party considers
relevant to such defense and the making available to the Indemnifying Party,
at no cost to the Indemnifying Party, of any employees of the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that in connection therewith the Indemnifying Party
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the impact thereof
on the operations of the Indemnified Party and further agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of all files, records and other information furnished by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 6.3_. In no event shall the
obligation of the Indemnified Party to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence be construed as imposing
upon the Indemnified Party an obligation to hire and pay for counsel in
connection with the defense of any claims covered by the indemnification set
forth in this _Article VI_; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
may, at its own option, cost and expense, hire and pay for counsel in
connection with any such defense. The Indemnifying Party agrees to keep any
such counsel hired by the Indemnified Party informed as to the status of any
such defense, but the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to retain sole
control over such defense. In addition, in no event shall an EQM Protected
Party be required to file a claim against any of the EQM Protected Parties in
order seek indemnification under _Section 6.1(a)_.

 



 

(d) The date on which the Indemnifying Party receives notification of a claim
for indemnification shall determine whether such claim is timely made.

 



 

(e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY
PARTYS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION HEREUNDER COVER OR INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES OR LOST
PROFITS SUFFERED BY ANY OTHER PARTY ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT RECOVERED IN A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY.

 



 

Section 6.4 _EQT Guaranty_.

 



 

(a) _Guaranty_. Subject to the terms of this _Section 6.4_, EQT Corporation
hereby unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees to the EQM
Protected Parties the payment and performance of EQT Gatherings and EQT
Gathering Holdings obligations, as applicable, under (i) ** ** _Section
6.1(a)_ and _(c)_ in each case subject to the applicable limitations in
_Article VI_, and (ii) _Section 5.6_ ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "
_Obligations_ ") when due and payable (the " _Guaranty_ ").

 



 

(b) _Amendments with Respect to Obligations, etc._ Other than as provided in
this _Section 6.4_, EQT Corporation agrees that EQM, EQM Gathering Opco,
Equitrans Investments

 



      
 

 



 

and Equitrans LP may, in EQMs, EQM Gathering Opcos, Equitrans Investments
or Equitrans LPs sole discretion, without notice to or consent of EQT
Corporation and without in any way releasing, affecting or impairing the
obligations and liabilities of EQT Corporation under the Guaranty, at any
time: (i) extend the time of payment of any amounts due under this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements and otherwise waive compliance with any
conditions, terms or covenants, or waive any breaches, defaults or events of
default under, or grant any other indulgences or forgiveness with respect to,
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) modify, amend or
change, in any manner, any terms or provisions of this Agreement (other than
this _Section 6.4_, it being understood and agreed that any modification of
this _Section 6.4_ shall require the written consent of EQT Corporation) or
any of the Ancillary Agreements, in each case in accordance with the terms
hereof and thereof, (iii) grant extensions with respect to this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements, (iv) effect any release, compromise or
settlement in connection with this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof;
provided, however, that EQT Corporation shall be released from its Obligations
hereunder to the same extent that EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings is
released from any of its Obligations, (v) assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof, and (vi) deal in all respects with EQT Gathering and EQT Gathering
Holdings as if the Guaranty were not in effect. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Guaranty shall in all respects be valid and binding on EQT
Corporation even if all or any portion of the assets of or equity (including
limited liability company interests or partnership interests) in, whether
owned directly or indirectly by EQT Corporation, or other beneficial interests
in EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings is transferred to any other person
or entity or there occurs any merger, consolidation, restructuring,
termination, dissolution or liquidation of EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering
Holdings.

 



 

(c) _Payment; Certain Waivers_. Other than as provided in _Section 6.4(g)_,
this is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, and the
liability of EQT Corporation under the Guaranty shall be primary, direct and
immediate, and not conditional or contingent upon pursuit by any of the EQM
Protected Parties of any remedies it may have against EQT Gathering or EQT
Gathering Holdings. EQT Corporation shall pay to the EQM Protected Parties,
upon demand, all expenses (including all reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by the EQM Protected Parties in connection with judicial enforcement of EQT
Corporations obligations under the Guaranty. EQT Corporation hereby waives
all surety defenses available to it as a guarantor (other than the defense of
payment and any defense that EQT Gathering and EQT Gathering Holdings may have
to the payment of the primary Obligations except for defenses arising out of
or related to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, or other similar laws).

 



 

(d) _Reinstatement_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section
6.4_, the Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time payment of all, or any part thereof, of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any of the EQM
Protected Parties, whether due to any bankruptcy or insolvency or otherwise.
The insolvency of EQT Gathering, EQT Gathering Holdings or EQT Corporation,
and any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding with respect thereto, shall
not affect in any way EQT Corporations unconditional and absolute liability
hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Subordination and No Subrogation_. Until the Obligations are paid in
full, EQT Corporation irrevocably waives any and all rights to which EQT
Corporation may be entitled, by operation of law or otherwise, upon making any
payment hereunder, (i) to be subrogated to the rights of any of the EQM
Protected Parties against EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings with respect
to such payment or otherwise to be reimbursed, indemnified or exonerated by
EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings in respect thereof, or (ii) to receive
any payment, in the nature of contribution or for any other reason, from any
person or entity with respect to such payment. No set-off, counterclaim or
reduction, no diminution of an obligation, and no defense of any kind or
nature that EQT Corporation may have against EQT Gathering, EQT Gathering
Holdings or any of the EQM Protected Parties shall affect, modify or impair
the obligations hereunder of EQT Corporation.

 



 

(f) _Representations and Warranties_. EQT Corporation hereby represents and
warrants that: (i) it will derive a substantial financial or other advantage
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all
necessary action and do not contravene any provision of EQT Corporations
organizational documents or any Applicable Law, order of Governmental
Authority or contract binding on EQT Corporation or its assets; (iii) no
action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or
regulatory body is required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement by EQT Corporation; (iv) the Guaranty
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of EQT Corporation
enforceable against EQT Corporation in accordance with its terms, subject to
(A) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and (B) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and (v) EQT Corporation has the financial
capacity to pay and perform, or cause to be paid and performed, its
obligations under the Guaranty.

 



 

(g) _Demands_. EQM shall make a demand to EQT Corporation for performance or
payment in writing, stating specifically that EQM is calling upon EQT
Corporation to pay under this Guaranty, stating briefly the specific
Obligation EQT Gathering or EQT Gathering Holdings, as the case may be, has
failed to pay and providing an explanation in reasonable detail of why such
payment is due under this Agreement. A demand satisfying the foregoing
requirements shall be required with respect to the Obligations before EQT
Corporation is required to pay and shall be deemed sufficient notice to EQT
Corporation.

under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.
