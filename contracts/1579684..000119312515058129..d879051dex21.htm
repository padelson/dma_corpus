Section 2.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) For purposes of determining the aggregate cash amount to be paid by the
Purchaser to the Sellers at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.5, not more
than five Business Days, but in no event less than three Business Days, before
the Closing, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the Sellers estimate of Working
Capital of the Business (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

(b) The consideration payable at the Closing (the " _Closing Cash
Consideration_ ") shall be an amount equal to (i) Base Cash Consideration,
(ii) (A) _plus_ , if Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Target Working
Capital, an amount equal to the amount by which Estimated Working Capital
exceeds the Target Working Capital, or (B) _minus_ , if the Target Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, an amount equal to the amount
by which Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital.

 

(c) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers will prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the " _Statement of
Working Capital_ ") setting forth the Sellers calculation of the Working
Capital, in each case as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ").

(d) Upon receipt from the Sellers, the Purchaser shall have 60 days to review
the Statement of Working Capital (the " _Review Period_ "). If the Purchaser
disagrees with the Sellers computation of Closing Working Capital, the
Purchaser may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a
notice to the Sellers (the " _Notice of Objection_ "), which sets forth its
objections to the Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Notice of Objection shall include only objections based
on (i) non-compliance with the accounting principles used in preparation of
the illustrative calculation of Working Capital set

 



16  forth on _Section 1.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, or (ii)
mathematical or factual errors in the computation of Closing Working Capital.
Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which the
Purchaser disagrees, together with a detailed explanation of the reasons for
disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth the
Purchasers calculation of Closing Working Capital based on such objections.
To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, the Purchaser shall be
deemed to have agreed with the Sellers calculation of all other items and
amounts contained in the Statement of Working Capital.

 

(e) Unless the Purchaser delivers the Notice of Objection to the Sellers
within the Review Period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the
Sellers calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Statement of Working
Capital shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. If the
Purchaser delivers the Notice of Objection to the Sellers within the
Review Period, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall, during the 30 days
following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension of such time period,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Working
Capital. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve their
disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the " _Independent Expert_ ") or, if such firm is
unwilling or unable so to act, each of the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
select one such firm and those two firms shall select a third firm, which
third firm shall be the "Independent Expert". The parties shall instruct the
Independent Expert promptly to review this Section 2.6 and to determine,
solely with respect to the disputed items and amounts so submitted, whether
and to what extent, if any, the Closing Working Capital set forth in the
Statement of Working Capital requires adjustment. The Independent Expert shall
base its determination solely on written submissions by the Purchaser and the
Sellers and not on an independent review. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall
make available to the Independent Expert all relevant books and records and
other items reasonably requested by the Independent Expert. The parties shall
request that the Independent Expert deliver to the Purchaser and the Sellers,
as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 45 days after its
retention, a written report that sets forth its resolution of the disputed
items and amounts and its calculation of Closing Working Capital;  _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to each disputed item in relation to the
computation of the Closing Working Capital, the Independent Expert shall adopt
the position of either the Sellers or the Purchaser with respect to such
item. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the Independent Expert shall
be allocated between the parties based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party.

(f) Within three Business Days after Closing Working Capital has been finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.6:

(i) if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working
Capital, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in this Section
2.6, an amount of cash equal to the difference between the Estimated Working
Capital and Closing Working Capital; or

 



17 (ii) if the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers, in the manner and with interest as
provided in this Section 2.6, an amount of cash equal to the difference
between the Estimated Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital.

 

(g) Any payment required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(f) shall be made
by the party required to make such payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the party entitled to
receive such payment at least one Business Day prior to such transfer. The
amount of any such payment shall bear interest from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in
effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to but
excluding the date of payment. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the
basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, without
compounding.

 

Section 2.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Sellers shall prepare a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and liabilities treated as assumed
for Tax purposes and other capitalized costs) among the Purchased Assets in
accordance with Code Section 1060 and the Treasury regulations thereunder (and
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate). The
Sellers shall deliver such proposed allocation to the Purchaser not later than
30 days following the final resolution of the Closing Working Capital pursuant
to Section 2.6. If the Purchaser and the Sellers agree upon such
proposed allocation, then such proposed allocation shall become the final
allocation (the " _Final Allocation_ "). If the Purchaser raises any
objections in respect of the proposed allocation, then the Purchaser and the
Sellers shall negotiate in good faith until they will have resolved all such
objections and the so negotiated allocation shall become the Final Allocation.
The Sellers and the Purchaser and their Affiliates shall report, act and file
Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects
and for all Tax purposes consistent with such Final Allocation. The Purchaser
shall timely and properly prepared, execute, file and deliver all such
documents, forms and other information as the Sellers may reasonably request
to prepare such Final Allocation. None of the Sellers or the Purchaser (nor
their Affiliates) shall take any Tax position (whether in audits, Tax Returns
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Final Allocation unless required
to do so by applicable Law. If, after the proposed allocation becomes the
Final Allocation, any event occurs that will result in an adjustment of the
Purchase Price (including pursuant to Section 2.6), then the Purchaser and
the Sellers (and their respective Affiliates) shall amend the Final
Allocation accordingly.

Section 2.8 _Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that consents and waivers
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements may be required from parties to Contracts to which any
Seller is a party, including certain of the Contracts listed on the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, or with respect to other Purchased Assets, and that such
consents and waivers may not be obtained. The Sellers agree (x) to give all
required notices to third parties, and (y) to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all such third-party consents and waivers, without any
material conditions to such consent or waiver or changes or modifications of
terms thereunder. If any such consent or waiver is not obtained prior to
Closing, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate in any reasonable
arrangement pursuant to which (A) the Sellers and the Purchaser shall both use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such consents and (B) the
Sellers shall, to the greatest extent permitted by

 



18  Law and any such Contract (including by acting as an agent of the
Purchaser), hold such Contract or any claim, right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser
such that the Purchaser receives the interest of the Sellers in the benefits
therefrom, net of any reasonable expenses incurred by the Sellers or any
Affiliate thereof in connection with such arrangement until such time as
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained. Except as to any
Contract providing for payment or receipt by the Sellers of aggregate annual
payments in excess of $500,000 that has not been made available to the
Purchaser prior the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees that except
as provided in this Section 2.8 or Section 9.2, the Sellers shall not have any
liability to the Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain
any consents or waivers that may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreement or
because of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof. With respect
to any consent or waiver of a third party set forth in Section 7.2(e), the
Sellers shall be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, all amounts that may
be contractually required to be paid to any third party and any reasonable
fees and expenses that the third party incurs and contractually
requires reimbursement in connection with any such consents or waivers.
Notwithstanding that any such consent or waiver (other than any consents and
waivers set forth in Section 7.2(e)) is not obtained prior to the Closing, the
Closing shall take place on the terms set forth herein.

Section 6.1 _Conduct of Business_. During the period from the date hereof and

_Section 6.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, the Sellers shall carry on
the Business in the ordinary course of business in all material respects and
the Sellers

 



34  shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the material
business relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors and others with
whom the Sellers or their Affiliates transact business in connection with the
conduct of the Business in the ordinary course. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, during such period, except as contemplated by
this Agreement or as required by applicable Law, the Sellers shall not, and

with respect to the Business, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned):

 

(a) adopt or propose any amendment to the certificate of incorporation, bylaws
or other constitutive or governing documents of any Seller that would
adversely affect the ability of such Seller to consummate of the transactions
contemplated hereby;

(b) mortgage, pledge or subject to Liens any Purchased Asset, other than

other than immaterial transfers or dispositions and inventory sold, used or

(g) incur any material indebtedness for borrowed money affecting the Business

Real Property that by its terms would otherwise expire;

(j) increase or decrease the overall remuneration of any Business Employee

(m) announce an intention, or agree formally or informally to take any of the

Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Investigation_. The Sellers shall
afford to the Purchaser, its accountants and other representatives reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice during normal business hours prior to
the Closing, to the management of the Business, properties, other facilities,
Books and Records, Contracts and records of the Business; _provided_ , that
such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not (a) have
access to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information (in any form whatsoever, including through oral
conversations) that the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to
subject the Sellers to risk of liability, (b) have access to information
where such access would waive the attorney-client privilege or contravene any
Law or any Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, and (c)
be entitled to conduct any invasive sampling or testing with respect to
any Real Property (including with respect to groundwater, soil, air,
asbestos, surface water or sediment); _provided_ , that, in the case of clause
(b) above, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, including by
entering into a joint defense or common interest agreement with the
Purchaser, to permit the disclosure of such information without loss of such
privilege or contravention of such Law or Contract. The relevant parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances
in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

Section 6.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Sellers will give prompt
written notice to the Purchaser of any fact, event or occurrence which, if
existing or known as of the date hereof, would have been required to be set
forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule. No such disclosure by
the Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall otherwise affect or be deemed
to affect or modify any representation or warranty contained herein or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of the parties
(including indemnification rights under Article IX), nor shall any such
information, knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or modify any
partys reliance on the representations or warranties made by the other
parties in this Agreement.

Section 6.4 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date until the
second anniversary thereof, except as required by applicable Law, the Sellers
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, hold, and will cause its and their
respective representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information,
whether written or oral, concerning the Business, the Purchased Assets and
the other parties, except to the extent that such information (a) is in the
public domain through no fault of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or
their respective representatives or (b) is lawfully acquired by the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date from sources that are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation. If the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or
representatives is compelled to disclose any such information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, the Sellers shall
promptly notify the Purchaser and shall disclose only that portion of such
information that is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the
Sellers shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information.

 



36 Section 6.5 _Consents; Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including to obtain all consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and Orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, nothing set forth in this Section 6.5(a) shall be deemed to affect,
supersede or expand the conditions set forth under Section 7.2(e) hereof.

(b) The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each promptly apply for, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain or make, as applicable, all Orders and
Permits of, and all filings with, any Governmental Entity or other Person
required to be obtained or made by it for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate with and promptly
furnish information to the other party necessary in connection with any
requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if required, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
make an appropriate filing required of each of them pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten Business Days
following the execution of this Agreement (if not already made), which filings
shall not request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the
HSR Act. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each be responsible for one-half
of all filing and similar fees payable in connection with such filings and
for any local counsel fees.

(c) Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers agree to instruct its respective
counsel to cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any
issues arising under the HSR Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such
efforts and cooperation include, counsels undertaking (to the extent
permitted by Law and in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without waiving attorney-client or any other applicable
privilege) to (i) furnish to each others counsel such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR
Act and (ii) permit the other party to review and incorporate the other
partys reasonable comments in any filings or other communication given by it
to any Governmental Entity or in connection with any proceeding by a private
party related to the HSR Act. None of the Purchaser and the Sellers nor any of
their respective counsel shall independently contact any Governmental Entity
or participate in any meeting or discussion (or any other communication by
any means) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the case of
the Purchaser, the Sellers, and in the case of the Sellers, the Purchaser,
prior reasonable notice of the meeting or discussion, the opportunity to
confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts with and responses to
personnel of said Governmental Entity, the opportunity to review and agree to
the contents of any representations (oral or otherwise) expected to be
communicated at the meeting or discussion, and, to the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate at the
meeting or discussion (which, at the request of the Purchaser or the Sellers,
as applicable, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

 



37 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchaser (in good
faith consultation with the Sellers) shall take the lead in, and shall have
the sole discretion and authority with respect to: (i) the scheduling of, and
strategic planning for, any meeting with any Governmental Entity, including
under the HSR Act, (ii) the making of any filings with Governmental Entities,
including the initial filings under the HSR Act (other than the filings to be
made by the Sellers, which, after consultation the Purchaser, the Sellers
shall take the lead in making), (iii) the process for the receipt of any
necessary approvals of Governmental Entities, (iv) the resolution of any
investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity, (v) devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust or
competition clearances, including in connection with the determination of any
actions required in connection with obtaining such clearances, (vi) all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Entity, including in
connection with obtaining any such clearances referenced in the preceding
clause and (vii) determining if, and if so, the time, manner and terms upon
which, any divestitures, dispositions or other remedies would be implemented.

 

(e) The Purchaser agrees that prior to Closing it shall not enter into any
other transaction involving the acquisition, directly or
indirectly, newspapers or related publications overlapping any service areas
of the Purchased Assets. The Purchaser further agrees that the Purchaser
shall, to the extent necessary to obtain any required Orders or Permits from
any Governmental Entity, expiration or termination of any waiting period for
any regulatory approval, or to avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or
terminated any legal impediment to closing, take the following actions: (i)
propose, negotiate, consent to, offer to undertake, commit to and effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale, divestiture
or disposition (including by licensing any intellectual property) of any
Purchased Assets; and (ii) otherwise offer to take, commit to take or take
any action that it is capable of taking that limits its freedom of action with
respect to, including its ability to operate or retain, any of the Purchased
Assets; _provided_ , however, that the Purchaser shall not be required to
take any such action or actions to the extent such actions, in the aggregate,
would represent, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses that would
reasonably be likely to result in the one year loss of net sales revenues (as
measured by fiscal year 2014 net sales revenue) in excess of $4,000,000.

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Purchaser nor the Sellers
shall issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser
or the Sellers may, without such approval, make such press releases or other
public announcement as it believes are required pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market, applicable
securities Laws, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.

 



38 Section 6.7 _Employees_.

 

(a) The Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser, within ten (10) days after the
date hereof and again on the Closing, a list of each Business Employee, such
employees base salary and bonus opportunities, the employees date of hire,
and the primary geographic location of their employment with the Sellers, as
of the date hereof, broken down into the following categories: (i) active,
(ii) inactive on leave of absence with reemployment rights and (iii) on short-
term disability under the Sellers short-term disability policies. From the
date hereof to the Closing, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make all Business Employees reasonably available to the Purchaser
for in-person and telephonic interviews to assist the Purchaser in evaluating
if offers of employment will be made. Excluding employees who are part of a
collective bargaining unit, not less than five days prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser (i) agrees that it will make offers of employment to the greater of
(A) substantially all of the Business Employees and (B) a number of Business
Employees in their current positions and locations that would not create any
obligation or liability under WARN or similar state law; and (ii) will provide
to the Sellers a list of Business Employees to whom the Purchaser does
not intend to make offers of employment.

(b) The Purchaser will make offers of employment to all of the Business
Employees that are not on the list provided by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 6.7(a) to commence effective upon the Closing. Such offers may be made
before the Closing as the Purchaser may determine. Such offers of employment
shall be at comparable wage rates or base salary and bonus levels as are
identified in Section 4.16(a), and, if at a location different from the
Business Employees current location of employment with Sellers, at a
commuting distance no greater than 50 miles farther away from such Business
Employees current location of employment. With respect to each Business
Employee who accepts the Purchasers offer of employment (a " _Transferred
Employee_ "), the Purchaser shall credit periods of service prior to the
Closing for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and benefit
entitlement under all compensation and benefit plans, programs and policies
maintained by the Purchaser after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Purchaser shall not be required to credit any service to the extent that
doing so would result in duplication of benefits, and further provided that
nothing herein entitles any Transferred Employee to contributions under any
retirement plan for time periods prior to the Closing. Not later than the
Closing Date, the Sellers will provide to the Purchaser such information with
respect to each Transferred Employee as may be reasonably necessary to permit
the Purchaser to comply with its covenants in this Section 6.7 with respect
to the Transferred Employees.

(c) The Purchaser further agrees that it will not engage in any action
within 90 days following the Closing that will create any obligation or
liability under WARN to any Business Employee or Transferred Employee.

 

(d) Without limiting the scope of Section 6.7(b), the Purchaser shall provide
each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) with the
opportunity to be covered by a group health plan (within the meaning of
section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) on the first day of the month following the
Closing. The Sellers shall cover the Transferred Employees under
Sellers group health plans until the end of the month in which the Closing
occurs and shall remain responsible for all claims incurred by Transferred
Employees while such employees

 



39  are covered by the Sellers group health plans. The Purchaser shall be
responsible for all claims incurred by the Transferred Employees while such
employees are covered by the Purchasers group health plans. For purposes of
clarity, a claim shall be considered incurred when the treatment for a given
condition is provided, and not when the condition arose.

 

(e) Purchaser will maintain or, if it does not exist, establish, a health care
and dependent care flexible spending account arrangement pursuant to Section
125 or 129 of the Code (collectively, " _FSAs_ "). Purchaser will honor the
elections of all Transferred Employees under the FSAs of the Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and Purchaser will assume responsibility for administering all
reimbursement claims of the Transferred Employees with respect to the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs that are submitted to Purchaser
for payment on or after the Closing Date, whether arising before, on or after
the Closing Date, under Purchasers FSAs. As soon as practicable but no more
than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, and except to the extent
taken into account in the computation of Closing Working Capital, Sellers
will cause to be transferred to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to (i) the
sum of all contributions to the FSAs of Sellers or their respective Affiliates
with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs by or on
behalf of the Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date, reduced by (ii)
the sum of all claims incurred in the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs that are submitted to the Sellers for payment prior to the Closing
Date and paid by the FSAs of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates with
respect to such Transferred Employees prior to the date of such cash transfer
to Purchaser; provided, however, if this calculation results in a negative
number, then Purchaser will pay to the Sellers (on behalf of any relevant
Affiliate of each Seller) as soon as practicable but not more than forty-five
(45) days following the Closing Date, the amount by which (ii) exceeds (i).
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with
such information as is necessary for the Purchaser to establish FSAs for such
Transferred Employees, including, but not limited to, each such Transferred
Employees annual FSA election amount and account balance as of the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall not administer any
claims under the FSAs of the Sellers for any year prior to the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs.

(f) As soon as administratively practicable after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall establish a 401(k) plan, or cause an existing 401(k) plan, to cover the
Transferred Employees, subject to contrary collective bargaining agreement
provisions (if any) applicable to Transferred Employees after Closing. The
Purchaser shall permit such Transferred Employees to rollover their account
balances (other than outstanding loan amounts) from the Stephens Media
Retirement Savings Plan to the Purchasers 401(k) plan.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall remain liable for all
withdrawal liability relating to any obligation (current, past or future,
contingent or otherwise (in each case with respect to multiemployer plan
participation for periods before Closing)) on the part of the Sellers or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates to contribute to any multiemployer plan
and shall pay all such liabilities as they come due. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Purchaser nor its ERISA
Affiliates shall be or shall become liable for any such withdrawal liability,
nor shall the Purchaser or any ERISA Affiliate incur an obligation to
contribute to any multiemployer plan in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



40 (h) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section 6.7, express
or implied, shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative
or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing
contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
employee benefit plan of the Purchaser or Sellers, (ii) obligate the
Purchaser or any of its ERISA Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular
benefit plan or arrangement or (B) retain the employment of any particular
employee, (iii) prevent the Purchaser or any of its ERISA Affiliates from
amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement, or (iv) give any
third party the right to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(i) The Sellers shall (i) with respect to all Benefit Plans, timely make all
required payments, premiums or contributions for all periods (or partial
periods) ending prior to or as of the Closing Date and (ii) take such actions
to cause all payroll and paid time off obligations accrued through the Closing
Date, including Accrued Employee Liabilities, to be timely paid.

 

Section 6.8 _Taxes_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall pay 100% of all federal, state and local sales and
use, documentary and real estate and other transfer taxes, if any, due as a
result of the purchase, sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets in accordance
herewith, whether imposed by Law on the Sellers or the Purchaser. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns regarding any transfer taxes which become payable
as a result of the transfer of the Purchased Assets from the Sellers to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations levied and assessed with respect to the Purchased Assets for a
taxable period prior to the period that includes the Closing Date shall be
paid by the Sellers. All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem obligations levied and assessed with respect to the
Purchased Assets for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date shall be apportioned between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of
the Closing Date based on the number of days of such taxable period included
in the period ending with and including the Closing Date (with respect to any
such taxable period, the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and the number of days
of such taxable period beginning after the Closing Date (with respect to any
such taxable period, the " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). The Sellers shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Purchaser shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing
Tax Period. If bills for such Taxes have not been issued as of the Closing
Date and if the amount of such Taxes for the period including the Closing Date
is not then known, the apportionment of such Taxes shall be made at Closing
on the basis of the prior periods Taxes. After Closing, upon receipt of bills
for the period including the Closing Date, adjustments to the apportionment
shall be made by the parties, so that if either party paid more than
its proper share at the Closing, the other party shall promptly reimburse
such party for the excess amount paid by such party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent the apportionment of any Taxes is included as part of
the purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6, any amount so included
will not be subject to the apportionment described in this Section 6.8(b).

 



41 (c) The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any Action relating to any Tax. Any expenses
incurred in furnishing such information or assistance shall be borne by the
party requesting it.

(d) The Purchaser shall prepare and file any Local Tax Returns due after the
Closing Date (including any final returns, as appropriate) for (i) taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date or which include the Closing Date or
(ii) the last taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date if the Tax
Return is due after the Closing Date. Such Local Tax Returns will be prepared
consistent with prior practice. The Sellers will reimburse the Purchaser for
any Taxes shown due on such returns to the extent that such Taxes are not
Assumed Liabilities under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4. Prior to filing any
Local Tax Returns in accordance with this Section 6.8(d), the Purchaser will
provide the Sellers a copy of any such returns for their review and comment,
which comments shall be incorporated into such Local Tax Returns prior to
filing. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall control on the Sellers
behalf any tax audits with respect to Local Tax Returns filed by the Purchaser
after the Closing Date, and will cooperate with the applicable Taxing
Authority to reach a resolution of any such audit. The Purchaser shall (x)
keep the Sellers informed of the status of any such audit, and (y) will not
agree to a settlement or resolution without the Sellers prior written
consent. The Sellers shall be responsible for the liability resulting from
such audit to the extent that such liability is not an Assumed Liability. The
Sellers shall prepare and timely file all sales Tax Returns due after the
Closing Date for (i) taxable periods ending after the Closing Date or which
include the Closing Date or (ii) the last taxable period ending prior to the
Closing Date if the sales Tax Return is due after the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.9 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Except as provided in Section 9.2(e), the
Purchaser and the Sellers hereby waive compliance by the Sellers and the
Purchaser with the bulk sales Laws and any other similar Laws in any
applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 6.10 _Access to Books and Records_. Each Seller and the Purchaser
shall preserve until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date all records
possessed or to be possessed by such party relating to any of the assets,
Liabilities or business of the Business prior to the Closing. After the
Closing Date, where there is a legitimate business purpose, such party
shall provide the other party with reasonable access, upon prior reasonable
written request specifying the need therefor, during regular business hours,
to (a) the officers and employees of such party and (b) the books of account
and records of such party, but, in each case, only to the extent relating to
the assets, Liabilities or business of the Business prior to the Closing, and
the other party and its representatives shall have the right to make copies of
such books and records at their sole cost; provided, however, that the
foregoing right of access shall not be exercisable in such a manner as to
interfere unreasonably with the normal operations and business of such

 



42  party. Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a party if such party
sends to the other party written notice of its intent to destroy records,
specifying with particularity the contents of the records to be destroyed.
Such records may then be destroyed after the 60th day after such notice is
given unless the other party objects to the destruction, in which case the
party seeking to destroy the records shall deliver such records to
the objecting party at the objecting partys cost.

Section 6.11 _Further Assurances_. The Purchaser and the Sellers
shall execute such documents and other instruments and take such further
actions as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out the provisions
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall each use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions and to do or cause to be done all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If
requested by the Sellers, the Purchaser will provide written confirmation
to the other parties to any Assigned Contract of the Purchasers assumption
thereof in the form required by such Assigned Contract or otherwise reasonably
requested by the Sellers. If at any time after the Closing: (a) The Sellers
receive any cash in respect of any Purchased Assets, Sellers shall remit such
cash to the Purchaser or its designee promptly following such receipt; and (b)
the Purchaser or any Subsidiary thereof receives any cash in respect of any
Excluded Asset, the Purchaser or such Subsidiary shall remit such amount to
the Sellers or its designee promptly following such receipt.

Section 6.12  _Support Services_. Except as set forth in Section 2.8 and
Articles VI and IX of this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement,
the Purchaser agrees that as of the Closing Date, the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any support or
other services to the Business (including any of the services for which
allocations were previously paid by the Business).

 

Section 6.13 _Lease Guaranty_. The Purchaser shall assume all obligations of
reimbursement under each guaranty arising after the Closing Date by the
Sellers for any Leased Real Property and/or replace any applicable letters of
credit associated therewith and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from the applicable beneficiary a full release of all parties
liable, directly or indirectly, for reimbursement in connection with such
guaranty or credit support obligations. To the extent the Purchaser is unable,
notwithstanding its compliance with the immediately preceding sentence, to
obtain such release, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Sellers against, and reimburse the Sellers for, any and all Losses in
connection with such guaranty arising after the Closing Date, and shall in any
event promptly reimburse the Sellers to the extent such guaranty is called
upon and the Sellers makes any payment thereunder.

Section 6.14 _Noncompetition and Related Covenants_.

(a) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, none of the Sellers or
any of their respective members, managers, equity owners will invest in, own,
manage, operate, finance, control, advise or guarantee the obligations of any
Person whose business includes any daily, bi-weekly or weekly local print,
online or other digital news publication, which is

 



43  primarily targeted at and is primarily intended to serve any county or
portion thereof that are currently served by the Business (which shall include
those counties listed on _Section 6.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_)
other than Pulaski County, Arkansas; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall any of the following be deemed a breach or violation of this Section
6.14: (A) ownership of less than 5% of any publicly traded company; (B)
investing in, owning, managing, operating, financing, controlling, advising or
guaranteeing the obligations of any Person whose business operates at a
national level, even if a portion of that business competes in the individual
markets that the Business presently serves; or (C) any current activity of any
Seller or any Affiliate other than the activities of the Business.

 

(b) For a period of two years after the Closing Date, none of the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates will induce or attempt to induce any individual who
is then an employee or independent contractor of the Purchaser or any of its
wholly owned subsidiaries to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of
the Purchaser, or in any way knowingly interfere with the relationship
between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and any such employee or independent
contractor thereof, on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this Section 6.14 shall prohibit the Sellers or any member of the Sellers
from engaging in any general employment solicitation (including solicitations
through recruiting firms and the Internet) not targeted at employees of the
Business, or from hiring any individual who responds to any such solicitations
without encouragement from the Sellers or any member of the Sellers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 6.14(b) (i)

will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This Section 6.14 will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed _provided_ , for the purpose of clarity, that in no
event shall this Section 6.14 be binding upon any Seller or any member of any
Seller following the second anniversary of the Closing Date in the case of

individuals with knowledge of such data and financial information, in each
case as may be necessary or required in connection with the preparation of

Transferred Employees responsibilities to the Purchaser and its Affiliates,
and, to the extent that a Transferred Employee is required to spend
significant time on such matters, Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser at a rate

warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing hereunder and continue in full force and effect for a period of 12

resulting from or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation and warranty of the Sellers contained in
this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(d);

 

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers contained herein;

 

(c) any Excluded Liabilities (regardless of whether or not the Sellers may

(d) any claims related to or based upon the pre-closing relationship between
the Sellers and any Business Employee, other than any claim related to the
termination of a Business Employee as a result of the Purchasers decision not
to offer such Business Employee a position with the Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof; and

 



49 (e) any noncompliance with any bulk sales Laws, fraudulent transfer Laws or
similar Laws in any applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 9.3  _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations
set forth herein, following the Closing the Purchaser shall indemnify and
defend the Sellers against, and shall hold the Sellers harmless from, any Loss

the Purchaser and any Transferred Employee.

Section 9.4 _Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims_.

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnitor may be
liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall promptly, and in any event within 30
days, provide written notice to the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim (a "
_Claim Notice_ "). The Claim Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has
paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability
for Losses for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant
hereto, and (ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated liability and the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement curtained herein to which each such item is
related and the computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to
be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with the Claim Notice a
copy of all papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim and
any other documents evidencing such Third Party Claim. The failure to provide
such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its
obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnitor is
prejudiced by such failure.

 



50 (b) The Indemnitor will have 30 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor has
elected to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any
litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost
and expense (a " _Third Party Defense_ "). If the Indemnitor assumes the
Third Party Defense in accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (as to which the Indemnitee
shall not be entitled to indemnification) and participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnitee will not file any papers
or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
to the extent such judgment or settlement provides for equitable relief
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee. The parties hereto will
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party
Claims, act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with such claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to and copies of all information, records and
documents relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the
Third Party Defense, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent. 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense within 30 days
of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitee will be entitled to assume the
Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense (or, if the Indemnitee incurs
a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3, as
applicable, at the expense of the Indemnitor) upon delivery of notice to such
effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor (i)
shall have the right to participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole
cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense
and settlement thereof; and (ii) will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnitee hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that
was consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The
Indemnitee will provide written notice to the Indemnitor promptly, and in any
event within 30 days, following its discovery of any matter for which the
Indemnitor may be liable hereunder that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, which Claim Notice shall (i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or
properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for Losses
for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant hereto, and
(ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss included in
the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly accrued, the
basis for any anticipated liability and the representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein to which each such item is related and the
computation of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled
hereunder. If the Indemnitor does not acknowledge in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such Losses within 30 days after its
receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies
as may be available to it hereunder. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under
this Article IX except to the extent that the

 



51  Indemnitor is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitee will reasonably
cooperate with and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any
claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such
matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such
matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense
and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance
with respect to such matters.

Section 9.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) No party hereto shall be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Person pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a): (i) unless a Claim
Notice is delivered prior to the expiration of the relevant representation or
warranty, as applicable; and (ii) with respect to a claim pursuant to Section
9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a) for the breach of a representation and warranty
other than the Specified Representations, unless and until the aggregate
Losses of (A) the Purchaser, in the case of the Sellers, with respect to any
such claims, or (B) the Sellers, in the case of the Purchaser, with respect
to any such claims, exceed $512,500, at which point such party shall be liable
for all such Losses exceeding $512,500.

 

(b) In no event shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the
Sellers pursuant to Section 9.2(a) with respect to breaches
of representations and warranties other than the Specified Representations or
the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.3(a) with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties other than the Specified Representations on the
other hand, exceed $7,175,000.

(c) The amount of Losses payable under this Article IX by the Indemnitor shall
be reduced (i) by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under
insurance policies or from any other Person (less any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in collecting such amounts) and (ii) to take
account of any Tax benefit of the Indemnitee arising in connection with the
accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses in the taxable year in which
the indemnifiable Loss is incurred or the following taxable year.

 

(d) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any breach of a representation or warranty of such party to
the extent such breach arises from or relates to any item disclosed in the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to Sellers obligation to indemnify Purchaser for
Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities pursuant to Section 9.2(c), (ii) any
covenant or condition expressly waived in writing by another party on or prior
to the Closing, (iii) any indirect, special, incidental, consequential
or punitive damages, or (iv) any Loss to the extent such Loss was included in
the calculation of the adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.6. Each party hereto agrees that, for so long as such party has any right
of indemnification under this Article IX, it shall not, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its Affiliates do not,
voluntarily or by discretionary action, accelerate the timing or increase the
cost of any obligation of any other party under this Article IX, except to
the extent that such action is taken (x) for a reasonable legitimate purpose
and not with a purpose of discovering a condition that would constitute a
breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement of any other
party hereto or (y) in response to a discovery by such party, without
violation of the immediately preceding clause (x), of meaningful evidence of a
condition that constitutes a breach 

 



52  of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any other party
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an Indemnitor
shall not be obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee for any Loss to the extent
arising from any such voluntary or discretionary action, other than as so
excepted.

(e) In addition to the other limitations set forth in this Article IX, with
respect to any claim by the Purchaser for indemnification relating to Losses
arising out of, relating to or resulting from: (x) any breach of any
representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.17, or (y) any Excluded
Liability relating to environmental matters or Environmental, Health and
Safety Requirements, including Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities
(collectively, " _Environmental Losses_ "), the Sellers obligation to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Purchaser shall be limited to the
extent: (i) Purchasers insurer provides actual coverage, pursuant to the
Purchasers Environmental Insurance Policy, for the Environmental Loss; (ii)
(A) any such Environmental Loss arises out of a Third Party Claim that is
solicited by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, representatives or agents
or (B) any investigation, monitoring, removal, abatement, disposal,
remediation, corrective action, and/or any other response action (" _Response
Action_ ") forming the basis of any such Environmental Loss is not reasonably
necessary to comply with Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements and/or
notices, directives or orders from any Governmental Entities; (iii) any such
Environmental Loss would not have arisen but for any disclosure to any
Governmental Entity by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, representatives or agents, except to the extent such disclosure
was required by applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements
and/or any requests for information, notices, directives or orders from any
Governmental Entity; (iv) any such Environmental Loss would not have arisen
but for any intrusive investigations by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
representatives or agents that are not (A) reasonably necessary to comply with
applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements and/or any notices,
directives or orders from any Governmental Entity or (B) required by landlords
at Leased Real Property pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease, and with
respect to the Owned Real Property, any intrusive investigations by
prospective purchasers or tenants; (v) any Response Action forming the basis
for any such Environmental Loss exceeds the cost of reasonable, cost effective
Response Actions acceptable under Environmental, Health and
Safety Requirements (including engineering or institutional controls or any
lesser standards resulting from any site-specific risk assessments) based on
the industrial or commercial use of the relevant facility or property; and
(vi) any such Environmental Loss resulting from any condition or circumstance
caused, contributed to or exacerbated by the Purchaser, any Affiliate of the
Purchaser or any other Person under their control after the Closing Date.

 

(f) Except for the Purchasers rights to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2 or with respect to any claim for intentional fraud, the Purchaser shall
have no claim or right to indemnification, and none of the Sellers or any
other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to the other party
hereto or any other Person, with respect to any information, documents
or materials furnished or made available to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors by the Sellers
or Affiliates thereof or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents or advisors, whether orally or in writing, in certain "data
rooms", management presentations, functional "break out" discussions,
responses to questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser or in any other
form in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



53 Section 9.7 _Additional Procedures for Environmental Losses_.

 

(a) If the Purchaser seeks indemnification for any Environmental Losses, it
shall follow the claim procedures set forth in Section 9.4 or Section 9.5 as
modified and supplemented by the procedures set forth in this Section 9.7. Any
Claim Notice provided by the Purchaser for an Environmental Loss must: (i)
comply with the requirements and procedures set forth in Section 9.4 or
Section 9.5 and also must set forth with reasonable particularity the nature
of the condition or event underlying or giving rise to the Environmental Loss;
and (ii) include, to the extent known, the estimated amount of any
Environmental Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the

data, proposals, claims and correspondence in the possession of the Purchaser
or any Affiliate thereof relevant to the Environmental Loss.

(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall agree on a mutually satisfactory plan
for conducting, directing, managing, implementing and controlling the
resolution of any Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have an
indemnification responsibility or liability under this Agreement and for

9.4) or acknowledged (pursuant to Section 9.5) and are continuing to satisfy
their indemnification obligation hereunder, including (i) selecting and
retaining counsel and consultants, and (ii) raising timely and reasonable
objections and defenses.

(c) The Purchaser shall provide, via one or more site access agreements that
are mutually satisfactory to the parties, reasonable access to the relevant
Real Property to the Sellers and their representatives and agents (including,
if applicable pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.7(b), insurers and
indemnitors of the Sellers) to enable the Sellers to comply with their
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to Environmental Losses.

 

(d) With respect to any Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have an
indemnification obligation hereunder, the Sellers, subject to the provisions
in Section 9.7(b) above, if applicable, agree to provide the Purchaser with
the following: (i) copies of material draft reports and final reports, plans
and other material documents prior to the submission thereof to
any Governmental Entity, and an opportunity to comment on the same (which
comments will be given due and good faith consideration so long as they are
timely submitted); and (ii) an opportunity to meet with the Sellers and their
representatives prior to and following any material substantive
communications or meetings with any Governmental Entity. The Purchaser shall
not submit any substantive reports, plans or other documents to, or have any
substantive communications with, any Governmental Entity with respect to any
Environmental Loss for which the Sellers have formally assumed the defense of
(pursuant to Section 9.4) or acknowledged (pursuant to Section 9.5) and are
continuing to satisfy their indemnification obligation hereunder without
first obtaining the Sellers written consent to submit such documents or have
such communications.

Environmental Losses to the extent there is a conflict with the provisions
pertaining to procedural rights and obligations in other sections of this
Article IX.

 



54 Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and
agree that, except for the right to specific performance pursuant to Section
10.12 or with respect to any claim for intentional fraud, following the
Closing, the indemnification provisions of Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and the Sellers for any
breach by other party hereto of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or the certificates delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(c) and Section
7.3(c) and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply with any
covenants and agreements in this Agreement, and anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the
Purchaser or the Sellers after the Closing to rescind this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereto, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives any and
all rights, claims and causes of action which such party may have against any
other party hereto or any of its Affiliates arising under or based upon any
Law or otherwise, other than pursuant to this Article IX or with respect to
any claim for intentional fraud.

Section 9.9 _Mitigation_. Each party hereto shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.

Section 9.10  _Treatment of Indemnity Benefits_. All payments made by the
Sellers or the Purchaser pursuant to obligations under this Agreement shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.
