and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell,
transfer and deliver to Buyer, free and clear of all Liens (other than
restrictions on the ownership or transfer of securities arising under
applicable federal and state securities Laws), and Buyer shall purchase from
Seller, the Shares.

Section 2.2 _Consideration_. The consideration (the " _Purchase Price_ ") for
the sale of the Shares to Buyer shall be the combination of the Cash Portion
of the Purchase Price and the Stock Portion of the Purchase Price. The "
_Adjusted Cash Portion of the Purchase Price_ " shall be the Cash Portion of
the Purchase Price (a) as adjusted by the Initial Adjustment Amount determined
pursuant to Section 2.5, (b) as adjusted for Title Defects, if any, in
accordance with Section 5.2(d), (c) as adjusted for Seller Title Credits, if
any, in accordance with Section 5.4, (d) as adjusted for Environmental
Defects, if any, in accordance with Section 6.5, (e) as adjusted for excluded

Section 6.7, and (f) with respect to the amounts paid as a security deposit
by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the  terms of each of the Material Contracts described in items 17 through 34 of
_Schedule 3.1(h)_ , as adjusted upward by the amount equal to the sum of that
portion of the balance of each such security deposit existing as of the
Closing Date that is reimbursable to the Company pursuant to the terms of such
contracts after the Closing Date, which amount shall not exceed One Hundred
Thirty-One Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($131,000.00). Any such adjustments to
the Purchase Price shall be made to the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price.

Section 2.3  _Escrow_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, (i) Buyer, Seller and Citibank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ")
entered into the Deposit Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 2.3_  (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_ "), (ii) Buyer deposited an
amount equal to Ten Million and No/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) with the
Escrow Agent as a deposit hereunder (together with any interest earned
thereon, the " _Cash Deposit_ "). The Cash Deposit shall be held and
distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.4 _Payment of Closing Consideration_.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall (i) wire transfer the Adjusted Cash Portion of
the Purchase Price minus the Cash Deposit in immediately available funds to an
account specified by Seller to Buyer on or prior to the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) provide written instructions
to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Cash Deposit
pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement to Seller. 

(b) At the Closing, PVA shall issue and deliver to Seller or its designee,
free and clear of all Liens (other than restrictions on the ownership or
transfer of securities existing under applicable federal and state securities
Laws), such number of whole shares of PVA Stock, and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of PVA Stock, equal to the Stock Portion of the Purchase
Price. Not less than one (1) Business Day before the Closing Date, Buyer shall
deliver written notice to Seller of the number of shares of PVA Stock that
will comprise the Stock Portion of the Purchase Price to be delivered by PVA
to Seller at Closing.

Section 2.5 _Adjustment Period Cash Flow_.

 

(a) The Adjusted Cash Portion of the Purchase Price shall be increased or
decreased, as the case may be, by an amount equal to the Net Cash Flow with
respect to the Subject Assets for the time period (the " _Adjustment Period_
") beginning at the Effective Time and ending at 7:00 A.M. (local time) on the
Closing Date (such time being the " _Closing Time_ "). Seller shall deliver
to Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days immediately preceding the Closing
Date a statement (the " _Initial Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth
Sellers preliminary good faith determination (the " _Initial Adjustment
Amount_ ") of the Net Cash Flow, together with reasonably supporting
documentation of the same. If the Initial Adjustment Amount shown on the
Initial Adjustment Statement is a positive number, then the Adjusted Cash
Portion of the Purchase Price shall be increased by such amount. If the
Initial Adjustment Amount shown on the Initial Adjustment Statement is a
negative number, then the Adjusted Cash Portion of the Purchase Price shall
be decreased by such amount.

(b) The " _Net Cash Flow_ " shall be the sum of (in each case, without
duplication) (i) a positive amount equal to the aggregate amount of the direct
costs and expenses (including capital expenditures and lease operating
expenses) of ownership, exploration, maintenance, development, production
and operation of the Subject Assets which are incurred by the Company or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the Adjustment Period (including, for this
purpose, prepayments of any such costs or expenses) and paid by the Company or
any of its Affiliates before the Closing Time (which costs and

 



\- 2 -   expenses shall include (x) Asset Taxes, but exclude any other Taxes and (y)
with respect to the Subject Assets operated by the Company, all direct costs
and expenses (including capital expenditures and lease operating expenses)
chargeable to the joint account in connection with the exploration,
maintenance, development, production and operation of such Subject Assets
pursuant to the operating agreement applicable thereto for which neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates have received reimbursement before the
Closing Time from the other parties bound by such operating agreement), (ii) a
positive amount equal to the sum of (A) all overhead charges paid by
the Company or any of its Affiliates before the Closing Time to any operator
of any of the Subject Assets and incurred with respect to the Adjustment
Period, and (B) with respect to the Subject Assets operated by the Company,
the overhead chargeable to the joint account pursuant to each of the existing
operating agreements for such Subject Assets and incurred with respect to the
Adjustment Period for which neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates have
received reimbursement before the Closing Time from the other parties bound
by any such operating agreement (which overhead shall include, for the
avoidance of doubt, the amount Buyer would be required to pay to the Company
under such operating agreement with respect to the Subject Assets as if the
Company operated and Buyer owned the Subject Assets as of the Effective Time),
and (iii) a negative amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds (less any
royalties and other non-Tax burdens and Asset Taxes measured by or payable
out of such production to the extent not taken into account in subparagraph
(i) above) received by the Company or any of its Affiliates before the Closing
Time (A) from the sale or disposition of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons
produced from the Subject Assets during the Adjustment Period, (B) from the
rental, sale, salvage, or other disposition of any other Subject Assets during
the Adjustment Period or (C) otherwise attributable to the ownership of the
Subject Assets during the Adjustment Period (excluding, however, all costs and
expenses described in subparagraph (i)(y) above and all overhead charges
described in subparagraph (ii)(B) above for which the Company or any of its
Affiliates receives reimbursement before the Closing Time from the other
parties bound by any such operating agreement).

Section 2.6 _Post Closing Review_. After the Closing, Seller shall review the
Initial Adjustment Statement and determine the actual Net Cash Flow. On or
prior to the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Seller shall present
Buyer with a statement of the actual Net Cash Flow and such supporting
documentation as is reasonably necessary to support the Net Cash Flow shown
therein (the " _Final Adjustment Statement_ "). Buyer will give
representatives of Seller reasonable access to its premises and to the books
and records of Buyer and the Company for purposes of preparing the Final
Adjustment Statement and will cause appropriate personnel of Buyer and, if
applicable, the Company to assist Seller and Sellers representatives, at no
cost to Seller, in the preparation of the Final Adjustment Statement. Seller
will give representatives of Buyer and, if applicable, the Company reasonable
access to its premises and to its books and records for purposes of reviewing
the calculation of Net Cash Flow set forth in the Final Adjustment Statement
and will cause appropriate personnel of Seller to assist Buyer and its
representatives, at no cost to Buyer or the Company, in verification of such
calculation. The Final Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding on
Seller and Buyer as to the Net Cash Flow sixty (60) days following the date
the Final Adjustment Statement is received by Buyer, except to the extent that
prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period Buyer shall deliver to
Seller notice, as hereinafter required, of its disagreement with the contents
of the Final Adjustment Statement. Such notice shall be in writing and set
forth all of Buyers disagreements with respect to any portion of the Final
Adjustment Statement, together with Buyers proposed changes thereto, and
shall include an explanation in reasonable detail of, and such supporting
documentation as is reasonably necessary to support, such changes. If Buyer
has timely delivered such a notice of disagreement to Seller, then, upon
written agreement between Buyer and Seller resolving all disagreements of
Buyer set forth in such notice, the Final Adjustment Statement will become
final and binding upon Buyer and Seller as to the Net Cash Flow. If the Final
Adjustment Statement has not become final and binding by the ninetieth (90th)
day following its receipt by Buyer, then Buyer or Seller may submit
any unresolved disagreements of Buyer set forth in such notice to Deloitte and
Touche LLP (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") who shall be

 



\- 3 -   designated to act as an arbitrator and to decide all points of disagreement
with respect to the Final Adjustment Statement, such decision to be binding
upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such arbitrator to render its decision within fifteen (15)
Business Days after such points of disagreement are submitted to such
arbitrator. The costs and expenses of such arbitrator shall be borne equally
by Seller and Buyer. Upon resolution of such unresolved disagreements of
Buyer, the Final Adjustment Statement shall be final and binding upon the
Parties as to the Net Cash Flow. Promptly after the date the Final Adjustment
Statement becomes final and binding, Seller or Buyer, as appropriate, shall
pay in cash to the other Party the amount, if any, by which the Net Cash Flow
as shown in the Final Adjustment Statement is less than or exceeds the Initial
Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date until
paid at the Agreed Rate. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.6 to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 2.6 shall limit any Partys rights or
obligations set forth in Section 10.1.

Letter required to be satisfied by it. PVA has no reason to believe that any
portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not be available
to PVA and Buyer on a timely basis to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. PVA and its Affiliates are not required to pay any fees or other
amounts to the Financing Sources in connection with the Financing prior to the
execution of this Agreement, except those fees and other amounts which PVA and
its Affiliates have paid in full as of the execution date of the Commitment
Letter. The obligations of the other parties to the Commitment Letter to fund
the full amount of the Financing to PVA and Buyer pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions other than the conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter. There are no side contracts or
understandings (other than for customary fee letters and engagement letters)
related to the Financing under the Commitment Letter other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter.

ARTICLE IV

_INVESTIGATION OF SUBJECT ASSETS; CONFIDENTIALITY_

Section 4.1  _Investigation of Subject Assets_. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement and until the Closing Date (or earlier termination
of this Agreement), Seller (i) shall permit Buyer and its representatives at
reasonable times to examine, in Sellers offices, all Records including
abstracts of title, title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease files,
assignments, division orders, and similar documents relating to the Subject
Assets insofar as the same are in the possession or control of Seller or the
Company and insofar as Seller or the Company may do so without (a) violating
any legal constraint or confidentiality obligation to a third Person (
_provided_ that Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any necessary waivers of such obligations to allow disclosure of any
Records) or (b) waiving any attorney/client privilege and (ii) subject to any
required consent of any third Person ( _provided_ that Seller shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consents), shall permit
Buyer and its representatives at reasonable times and at Buyers sole risk,
cost and expense, to conduct, in the presence of Sellers representatives,
reasonable inspections of the Subject Assets; _provided_ that Buyer shall not
conduct any Phase II environmental testing or other invasive surface or
subsurface testing without Sellers prior written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _further_ , Buyer shall repair any damage
to the Subject Assets resulting from such inspections and Buyer does hereby
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Covered Liabilities arising from Buyers inspection of the
Subject Assets, _REGARDLESS OF ANY CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY
ON THE PART OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF
CLAIM WHETHER AT COMMON LAW, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER ANY
STATUTE OR REGULATION, EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, COVERED LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM
AND TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY_. 

 



\- 14 -  Section 4.2 _Obligations Under Confidentiality Agreement_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and PVA agree to maintain all information made
available to them pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or Section 4.1
confidential and otherwise to comply in all respects with, and to cause their
respective officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to
maintain all such information confidential and otherwise to comply in all
respects with the provisions regarding confidentiality in the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that, except with respect to the terms set forth in the first full paragraph
on page 4 of the Confidentiality Agreement (which terms are no longer in
effect as of the date hereof), nothing in this Section 4.2(a) shall affect or
limit any of the (i) other provisions set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement (including all provisions regarding non-solicitation and
standstill) or (ii) generally applicable provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such provisions relate to such other
provisions.

 

(b) Without limiting Sellers right to issue a press release pursuant to
Section 7.4, for a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing and
except as otherwise required by any requirements of Law, Seller agrees to
maintain all information relating to the Company with respect to the Subject
Assets confidential and otherwise to comply in all respects with, and to
cause its officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to
maintain all information relating to the Subject Assets confidential;
_provided, however_ , that the information subject to such
confidentiality restrictions shall not include information that is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by
Seller or its Affiliates.

Section 7.4, for a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing and
except as otherwise required by any requirements of Law, Buyer and PVA agree
to maintain all information relating to the Excluded Assets and all Subject
Assets assigned to Seller (or an Affiliate designated by Seller) pursuant to
Section 6.7 confidential and otherwise to comply in all respects with, and to
cause its officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to
maintain all information relating to such assets confidential; _provided,
however_ , that the information subject to such confidentiality restrictions
shall not include information that is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure by Buyer, PVA or their respective
Affiliates.

 

ARTICLE V

 

 _TITLE ADJUSTMENTS_

Section 5.1 _General Disclaimer; No Title Warranty or Representations_.
Without limiting Buyers right to receive an adjustment to the Purchase Price
by operation of Section 5.2, and except for the special warranty of
Defensible Title contained in Section 3.1(m), Seller makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Companys title to any of the Subject Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges
and agrees that, except as provided above, Buyers sole remedy for any defect
of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Subject
Assets shall be pursuant to the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE V.

Section 5.2 _Buyer s Title Review_.

 

(a) _Buyer s Assertion of Title Defects_. Prior to 5:00 P.M., Central Time,
on April 22, 2013 (the " _Defect Notice Date_ "), Buyer shall notify Seller
in writing of any matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute
Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect with respect
to any Property Subdivision pursuant to this ARTICLE V. For all purposes of
this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Title Defect which
Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by written notice given to Seller on
or before 5:00 P.M., Central Time, on the Defect Notice Date. To be
effective, Buyers written notice of a Title Defect must include (i) a brief
description of the matter constituting the asserted Title Defect, (ii)
the Title Defect Amount attributable thereto claimed in good faith by Buyer
and (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any
title attorney

 



\- 15 -   or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of such asserted Title
Defect; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that Seller and Buyer are
in disagreement as to whether or not Buyers written notice of Title Defect
is effective as provided above, Seller and Buyer agree to resolve such dispute
pursuant to Section 5.5 of this Agreement. To give Seller an opportunity to
commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to give Seller
written notice of any Title Defect which Buyer determines exists promptly
following Buyers determination of the existence of same, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to 5:00 P.M., Central Time, on
the Defect Notice Date. Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller with written
notice of any Seller Title Credit which is discovered by any of Buyers
employees or representatives while conducting Buyers title review, due
diligence or investigation with respect to the Subject Assets and Property
Subdivisions.

(b) _Allocation of Consideration_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
allocated value of each Property Subdivision shall be the value specified for
such Property Subdivision in Part II of  _Exhibit A_ (the " _Allocated Value_
"). If any adjustment is made to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
5.2, a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the portion of the Purchase
Price allocated to the affected Property Subdivision in Part II of _Exhibit
A_.

(c) _Seller s Opportunity to Cure_. Seller shall have until one (1) day
before the Closing Date, at its cost and expense, if it so elects but without
obligation, to cure all or a portion of such asserted Title Defects. Subject
to Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect
and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto, if Seller within
such time fails to cure any Title Defect of which Buyer has given a timely and
effective written notice as required above and Buyer has not and does
not waive same on or before the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
the Property Subdivision affected by such uncured and unwaived Title Defect
shall be a " _Title Defect Property_ ".

 

(d) _Buyer s Title Adjustments_. Subject to Section 5.5, the special warranty
of Defensible Title contained in Section 3.1(m), and Buyers termination
right as provided in Section 13.1(a), as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to Title Defects, Buyer shall be entitled to reduce the Purchase
Price by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount
of Title Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect Properties (together
with the aggregate amount of all undisputed Environmental Defect Amounts with
respect to all Environmental Defect Properties) exceeds the Aggregate Defect
Deductible. " _Title Defect Amount_ " shall mean, with respect to a Title
Defect Property, the amount by which the value of such Title Defect Property
is impaired as a result of the existence of one or more uncured and unwaived
Title Defects, which amount shall be determined as follows:

(i) If Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount.

(ii) If the Title Defect results from the Company having a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ (in the case where the Title
Defect Property is a Well or Unit) or Part II(B) of _Exhibit A_ (in the case
where the Title Defect Property is the portion of an Undeveloped Lease
covering undeveloped lands), the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the Allocated Value specified on Part II(A)
of _Exhibit A_ or Part II(B) of _Exhibit A_ , as the case may be, for such
Title Defect Property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction
in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest specified for such Title Defect Property in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_
(in the case where the Title Defect Property is a Well or Unit) or Part II(B)
of _Exhibit A_ (in the case where the Title Defect Property is the portion of
an Undeveloped Lease covering undeveloped lands).

 



\- 16 -  (iii) If the Title Defect results from the Company having a lesser number
of undeveloped Net Acres in such Title Defect Property than the number of Net
Acres specified therefor under the column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in Part
II(B) of _Exhibit A_ , the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product
of (A) the difference between the number of Net Acres specified for such Title
Defect Property under the column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in Part II(B) of
_Exhibit A_ and the number of undeveloped Net Acres owned by the Company in
such Title Defect Property multiplied by (B) the result obtained by dividing
the number of Net Acres specified for such Title Defect Property under the
column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in Part II(B) of  _Exhibit A_ by the
Allocated Value specified for such Title Defect Property in Part II(B) of
_Exhibit A_.

(iv) If the Title Defect results from the Company having a greater Working
Interest in a Title Defect Property than the Working Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ , the Title Defect Amount shall be
equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the
increase in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with
respect to such Title Defect Property for the period from and after
the Effective Time which is attributable to such increase in the Companys
Working Interest; _provided, however_ , that no Title Defect Amount shall be
allowed on account of and to the extent that an increase in the Companys
Working Interest in a Property Subdivision is accompanied by a proportionate
increase of the Companys Net Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision.

(v) If the Title Defect results from the existence of a mortgage, pledge, lien
or security interest, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount sufficient to
discharge such Lien.

 

(vi) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in paragraphs
(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an
amount equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property
affected by such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such
Title Defect Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property); provided, that if such Title
Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount shall
be the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect, if less.

(vii) If a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect
Property throughout the entire productive life of such Title Defect Property,
such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount.

(viii) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a Lien
affects more than one Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect
to one Title Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the
curing of any other Title Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect
Property, the amount necessary to discharge such Lien or the cost and expense
of such curative work shall only be included in the Title Defect Amount for
one Title Defect Property and only once in such Title Defect Amount.

 

(ix) If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Property Subdivision (as
contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such Property
Subdivision) and a value has not been allocated specifically to such portion
of a Property Subdivision in Part II of _Exhibit A_ , then for purposes of
computing the Title Defect Amount, the Allocated Value of such Property
Subdivision shall be further allocated among the portions of such Property
Subdivision in the proportion that the portion of such Property Subdivision
affected by such Title Defect bears to the entire Property Subdivision. 

 



\- 17 -  (x) The Title Defect Amount attributable to a Title Defect Property or
any portion thereof shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect
Property or such portion thereof calculated in accordance with paragraph (ix)
above. For example, but without limitation, if the Company does not own fifty
percent (50%) of the Net Revenue Interest specified in Part II(A) of _Exhibit
A_ for a Title Defect Property and such unowned fifty percent (50%) interest
is also burdened by a Lien, the Title Defect Amount for such Title
Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value allocable to such fifty
percent (50%) interest notwithstanding that it may be affected by multiple
Title Defects.

 

(xi) If an Undeveloped Lease is affected by a Title Defect resulting from the
matters described in paragraph (ii) above and a Title Defect resulting from
the matters described in paragraph (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount
resulting from the matters described in paragraph (iii) above shall be
determined before determining the Title Defect Amount resulting from the
matters described in paragraph (ii) above.

(xii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to the foregoing with respect to a Title Defect is Twenty-five
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) or less, then the Title Defect Amount
with respect to such Title Defect shall be deemed to be zero.

Section 5.3 _Determination of Title Defects_. A portion of a Property
Subdivision shall be deemed to have a "Title Defect" if the Company fails to
have Defensible Title thereto as of the Effective Time and the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
following matters shall not be asserted as, and shall not constitute Title
Defects: (a) defects in the early chain of title consisting of the mere
failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of
heirship proceedings, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such
failure or omission results in another Persons superior claim of title to the
relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof or that another Person is
claiming the same; (b) defects arising out of lack of survey unless a survey
is expressly required by Laws; (c) defects arising out of lack of corporate
authorization, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such corporate
action was not authorized and results in another Persons superior claim of
title to the relevant Property Subdivision or portion thereof or that another
Person is claiming the same; (d) defects that have been cured by possession
under the applicable statutes of limitations; (e) defects or
irregularities resulting from or related to probate proceedings or the lack
thereof, which defects or irregularities have been outstanding for four (4)
years or more; (f) defects based solely on the existence of prior oil and gas
leases relating to the Subject Interests that are expired and no longer in
force and legal effect but not surrendered of record; (g) defects arising from
a mortgage encumbering the oil, gas or mineral estate of any lessor if such
mortgage would customarily be accepted in taking oil and gas leases and for
which the lessee would not customarily seek a subordination of such mortgage
to the Subject Interests affected thereby prior to conducting drilling
activities on the Subject Interests (unless a complaint of foreclosure has
been filed or any similar action taken by the mortgagee thereunder and in such
case such mortgage has not been subordinated to the Subject Interests affected
thereby); (h) defects based solely on lack of information in files of Seller
or the Company or references to documents if such documents are not in files
of Seller or the Company; and (i) defects based on a failure to record name
changes or mergers set forth on _Schedule 5.3(i)_ _in the applicable
records._

Section 5.4 _Seller Title Credit_. A " _Seller Title Credit_ " shall mean,
(a) with respect to each Property Subdivision described in Part II(A) of
_Exhibit A_ , the amount by which the value of such Property Subdivision is
enhanced by virtue of the Company having a greater Net Revenue Interest in
such

 



\- 18 -   Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in
Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ , (b) with respect to that portion of each
Undeveloped Lease that covers undeveloped lands, the amount by which the
value of such portion is enhanced by virtue of the Company having a greater
Net Revenue Interest in such portion than the Net Revenue Interest specified
for such Undeveloped Lease in Part II(B) of  _Exhibit A_, (c) with respect
to that portion of each Undeveloped Lease that covers undeveloped lands, the
amount by which the value of such portion of such Property Subdivision is
enhanced by virtue of the Company having a greater number of undeveloped Net
Acres in such portion of such Property Subdivision than the number of Net
Acres specified therefor under the column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in Part
II(B) of _Exhibit A_ or (d) with respect to each Property Subdivision
described in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ , the amount by which the value of such
Property Subdivision is enhanced by virtue of the Company having a lesser
Working Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Working Interest
specified therefor in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ , in each case, as of the
Closing Date, which amount shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) If Buyer and Seller agree on the amount of the Seller Title Credit, then
that amount shall be the amount of the Seller Title Credit.

(ii) If the Seller Title Credit results from the Company having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision than the Net Revenue Interest
specified therefor in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ (in the case where the Seller
Title Credit affects a Well or Unit) or Part II(B) of _Exhibit A_ (in the case
where the Seller Title Credit affects the portion of an Undeveloped Lease
covering undeveloped lands), the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the Allocated Value specified on Part II(A) of
_Exhibit A_ or Part II(B) of _Exhibit A_ , as the case may be, for such
Property Subdivision by a fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in
the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_
(in the case where the Seller Title Credit affects a Well or Unit) or Part
II(B) of _Exhibit A_ (in the case where the Seller Title Credit affects that
portion of an Undeveloped Lease covering undeveloped lands).

(iii) If the Seller Title Credit results from the Company having a greater
number of undeveloped Net Acres in such Property Subdivision than the number
of Net Acres specified therefor under the column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in
Part II(B) of _Exhibit A_ , the Seller Title Credit shall be equal to the
product of (A) the difference between the number of Net Acres specified for
such Property Subdivision under the column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in Part
II(B) of _Exhibit A_ and the number of undeveloped Net Acres owned by the
Company in such Property Subdivision multiplied by (B) the result obtained by
dividing the number of Net Acres specified for such Property Subdivision under
the column entitled "Entity Und. Net" in Part II(B) of _Exhibit A_ by the
Allocated Value specified for such Property Subdivision in Part II(B) of
_Exhibit A_.

(iv) If the Seller Title Credit results from the Company having a lesser
Working Interest in a Well or Unit than the Working Interest specified
therefor in Part II(A) of _Exhibit A_ , the Seller Title Credit shall be
equal to the present value (discounted at 10% compounded annually) of the
decrease in the costs and expenses forecasted in the Reserve Report with
respect to such Property Subdivision for the period from and after
the Effective Time which is attributable to such decrease in the Companys
Working Interest; _provided, however_ , no Seller Title Credit shall be
allowed on account of and to the extent that a decrease in the Companys
Working Interest in a Property Subdivision is accompanied by a proportionate
decrease of the Companys Net Revenue Interest in such Property Subdivision.

 



\- 19 -  (v) In determining the amount of Seller Title Credits, the principles
and methodology set forth in paragraphs (vii), (viii), (ix), (xi) and (xii)
of Section 5.2(d) shall be applied, _mutatis mutandis_.

Seller shall be entitled to increase the Purchase Price by an amount equal to
the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of Seller Title Credits with
respect to all Property Subdivisions exceeds an amount equal to Seven Million
Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($7,500,000.00).

Section 5.5 _Deferred Claims and Disputes_.

(a) _Deferred Adjustment Claim_. In the event that Buyer and Seller have
not agreed upon one or more adjustments, credits or offsets claimed by Buyer
or Seller pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this ARTICLE
V, any such claim (a " _Deferred Adjustment Claim_ ") shall be
settled pursuant to this Section 5.5 and, except as provided in Section
8.1(e) and Section 8.2(g), shall not prevent or delay Closing. With respect to
each potential Deferred Adjustment Claim, Buyer and Seller shall deliver to
the other a written notice describing each such potential Deferred Adjustment
Claim, the amount in dispute and a statement setting forth the facts and
circumstances that support such Partys position with respect to such
Deferred Adjustment Claim. At Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be
adjusted on account of, and, except as provided in Section 8.1(e) and Section
8.2(g), no effect shall be given to, the Deferred Adjustment Claim. On or
prior to the thirtieth (30th) consecutive calendar day after the Closing
Date (the " _Deferred Matters Date_ "), Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to reach agreement on the Deferred Adjustment Claims and, ultimately, to
resolve by written agreement all disputes regarding the Deferred Adjustment
Claims.

(b) _Disputed Deferred Adjustment Claims_. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve all Deferred Adjustment Claims by the Deferred Matters Date, then
such claims shall be resolved by a single arbitrator, who shall be Johnny B.
Johnson at Wilson, Johnson and Stephens, L.L.P. and if such person refuses or is
unable to serve, as selected by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 5.5. Buyer and Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Title Arbitrator to render his or her determination within
fifteen (15) Business Days after a disputed matter is submitted to the Title
Arbitrator and such determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
without right of appeal. In making his or her determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this ARTICLE V and may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are
necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
disputed Deferred Adjustment Claims submitted by Buyer or Seller and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear (i) its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case and (ii) one-half of the fees, costs and expenses
of the Title Arbitrator. The amount of any reduction or increase in the
Purchase Price to which Buyer or Seller, as applicable, becomes entitled
under the final and binding written decision of the Title Arbitrator shall be
promptly refunded by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to such entitled Party.

 

(c) _Certain Seller Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, including Section 5.2(c), at any time prior to the point in time
when a final and binding written decision of the Title Arbitrator is made with
respect to any Title Defect which constitutes a Deferred Adjustment Claim in
accordance with this Section 5.5, Seller shall be entitled (i) to cure any
such Title Defect and (ii) to resolve all disputes relating to the Deferred
Adjustment Claims by payment to Buyer of the amount by which the Purchase
Price would have been reduced at Closing on account of the Title Defects
which constitute Deferred Adjustment Claims if same did not constitute
Deferred Adjustment Claims.

 



\- 20 -  Section 5.6 _No Duplication_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to
the contrary, if a Title Defect results from any matter which could also
result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in
Section 3.1 (other than Section 3.1(m)), then Buyer shall only be entitled
to assert such matter as a Title Defect pursuant to this ARTICLE V and shall
be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any
such representation or warranty.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

 _ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS_

Section 6.1 _Environmental Defects; Environmental Defect Amount_. "
_Environmental Defect_ " means any condition or circumstance (other than any
condition or circumstance set forth on _Schedule 6.1_) that, with notice to
the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction, would require Remediation under
Environmental Laws in, on or under a particular Subject Asset (including air,
land, soil, surface and subsurface strata, surface water, groundwater or
sediments) or would cause a particular Subject Asset to be in violation of any
applicable requirements of Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits, in
either case that is reasonably expected to reduce the value of the affected
Subject Asset by more than Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) or
require more than Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) to Remediate.
" _Environmental Defect Amount_ " means the cost to Remediate the
Environmental Defect. " _Environmental Defect Properties_ " means the Subject
Assets to which an Environmental Defect relates.

Section 6.2 _Environmental Defect Notice_. Prior to 5:00 P.M., Central Time,
on the Defect Notice Date, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any matters
that, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute an Environmental Defect (an "
_Environmental Defect Notice_ "). Each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in
writing and shall contain the following: (i) a description of the
asserted Environmental Defect, (ii) the identity of the specific Subject
Assets to which such Environmental Defect relates, (iii) the reason Buyer
believes such Subject Assets to have an Environmental Defect, (iv) the
Environmental Defect Amount attributable thereto claimed in good faith by
Buyer, and (v) documentation supporting Buyers asserted Environmental Defect.
To be valid, any Environmental Defect Notice must be received by Seller prior
to 5:00 P.M., Central Time, on the Defect Notice Date.

Section 6.3 _Failure to Deliver Environmental Defect Notice_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, from and after 5:00 P.M., Central Time, on
the Defect Notice Date, any matters that Buyer has Knowledge of and may
otherwise constitute an Environmental Defect, but of which Seller has not
been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with Section 6.2, will be
deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes. If Buyer fails to timely
deliver an Environmental Defect Notice with respect to any Subject Assets
regarding an Environmental Defect as to which Buyer has Knowledge, or if the
aggregate amount of all Environmental Defects Amounts with respect to
Environmental Defects, as applicable, timely asserted by Buyer and all Title
Defect Amounts with respect to Title Defects, as applicable, timely asserted
by Buyer is equal to or less than the Aggregate Defect Deductible based on the
estimates in the Environmental Defect Notice, Buyer shall be deemed to have
(i) accepted the environmental condition(s) in, on and under the affected
Subject Assets, (ii) waived its right to claim an Environmental Defect with
respect to that particular condition in, on or under the affected Subject
Assets, and (iii) included the particular environmental condition(s) as part
of the Company Liabilities.

Section 6.4  _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have until two (2) days
before the Closing Date (the " _Environmental Defect Cure Date_ "), at its
cost and expense, if it so elects but without obligation, to cure all or a
portion of asserted Environmental Defects prior to such date to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Parties, with no adjustment to the Purchase
Price in respect of such cured Environmental Defect.

 



\- 21 -  Section 6.5 _Environmental Defect Adjustments_. If Seller and Buyer agree that
an Environmental Defect exists and agree on the Environmental Defect Amount,
and Seller has been unable, or elects not, to cure such Environmental Defect
to the satisfaction of the Parties pursuant to Section 6.4, then Buyer shall
be entitled, at its sole and exclusive option, to (a) waive the Environmental
Defect that remains uncured and reduce the Purchase Price by the amount, if
any, by which the aggregate amount of all undisputed Environmental Defect
Amounts and all undisputed Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Defect
Deductible or (b) to the extent provided in Section 6.7, exclude the
Environmental Defect Properties affected by such Environmental Defect from the
Subject Assets. 

Section 6.6 _Aggregate Defect Deductible_. Notwithstanding anything herein
provided to the contrary, there will be no reduction of the Purchase Price on
account of an Environmental Defect and no amount owing by Seller unless and
until the aggregate amount of all undisputed Environmental Defect Amounts with
respect to the Environmental Defect Properties (together with the aggregate
amount of all undisputed Title Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect
Properties) exceed the Aggregate Defect Deductible, and in such event, the
reduction of the Purchase Price will be limited to (a) the amount in excess
of the Aggregate Defect Deductible or (b) in the event an Environmental Defect
Property has been excluded from the Subject Assets pursuant to Section 6.5 or
Section 6.7, the Allocated Value attributable to the Subject Asset comprising
such Environmental Defect Property.

Section 6.7 _Subject Assets Exclusion_. Notwithstanding anything herein
provided to the contrary, with respect to any Environmental Defect Properties,
either Seller or Buyer may elect prior to Closing to exclude such
Environmental Defect Properties from the Subject Assets held by the Company
at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to
exclude any Environmental Defect Property if the aggregate amount of all
undisputed Environmental Defect Amounts with respect to all Environmental
Defect Properties which have not been excluded pursuant to Section 6.5 or
this Section 6.7 (together with the aggregate amount of all undisputed Title
Defect Amounts with respect to all Title Defect Properties) fails to exceed
the Aggregate Defect Deductible. If Seller or Buyer exercises its right under
Section 6.5 or this Section 6.7, as the case may be, with respect to an
Environmental Defect Property, then (a) all Subject Assets comprising
such Environmental Defect Property together with a pro rata share of all

attributable or appurtenant thereto, shall be assigned by the Company to

Section 6.8 _Deferred Environmental Claims and Disputes_.

(a)  _Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claim_. In the event that Buyer and
Seller have not agreed on or prior to the Closing Date as to whether an
Environmental Defect exists or, if Buyer and Seller agree that an
Environmental Defect exists but disagree as to whether it has been cured or
on the amount of the Environmental Defect Amount attributable to such
Environmental Defect, any such claim (a " _Deferred Environmental Adjustment
Claim_ ") shall be settled pursuant to this Section 6.8 and, except as
provided in Section 8.1(e) and Section 8.2(g), shall not prevent or delay
Closing. With respect to each potential Deferred Environmental Adjustment
Claim, Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the other a written notice

8.2(g), no effect shall be given to, the Deferred Environmental Adjustment
Claim. On or prior to Deferred Matters Date, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in
good faith to reach agreement on the Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims
and, ultimately, to resolve by written agreement all disputes regarding the
Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims.

 



\- 22 -  (b) _Disputed Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims_. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve all Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims by the
Deferred Matters Date, then such matters shall be resolved by a single
arbitrator, who shall be Robert E. Morse, III at Crain Caton and James, and if
such person refuses or is unable to serve, as selected by the Houston office
of the American Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ ").
The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this Section 6.8(b). Buyer and Seller shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Environmental Arbitrator to render his or her
determination within fifteen (15) Business Days after a disputed matter is
submitted to the Environmental Arbitrator and such determination shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making his or
her determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules
set forth in this ARTICLE VI and may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Deferred
Environmental Adjustment Claims submitted by either Buyer or Seller and may
not award damages, interest or penalties to a Party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear (i) its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case and (ii) one-half of the fees, costs and expenses
of the Environmental Arbitrator. Upon the Environmental Arbitrators final
and binding determination of such Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims,
the amount of any reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer becomes
entitled under the final and binding written decision of the Environmental
Arbitrator shall be promptly refunded by Seller to Buyer.

(c) _Certain Seller Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, at any time prior to the point in time when a final and binding
written decision of the Environmental Arbitrator is made with respect to any
Environmental Defect which constitutes a Deferred Environmental Adjustment
Claim in accordance with this Section 6.8, Seller shall be entitled, (i) prior
to the Environmental Defect Cure Date, to cure any such Environmental Defect
or (ii) to resolve all disputes relating to a Deferred Environmental
Adjustment Claim by payment to Buyer of the amount by which the Purchase Price
would have been reduced at Closing on account of the Environmental Defects
which constitute Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims if same did not
constitute Deferred Environmental Adjustment Claims.

Section 6.9 _Sole Remedies_. Subject to Buyers termination right as provided
in Section 13.1(a) and, subject to Section 6.3, any remedy for breach of any
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1, the procedures set
forth in this ARTICLE VI shall be Buyers sole remedy for the existence of
any Environmental Defect.

Section 6.10  _NORM_. Buyer acknowledges that the Subject Assets have been
used for exploration, development and production of oil and gas and that there
may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials
located in, on or under the Subject Assets or associated with the Subject
Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Subject Assets may contain
asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Materials. NORM may affix or attach itself
to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms.
The wells, materials and equipment located on the Subject Assets or included
in the Subject Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous
Materials. NORM containing material and/or other wastes or
Hazardous Materials may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required
for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Materials
from the Subject Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be permitted to claim any Environmental Defect or breach of a
representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.1 on the account of the
presence of NORM on the properties underlying the Subject Assets.

Party be liable to make multiple payments of the same Covered Liabilities

the Closing Date with respect to all other Taxes (a " _Straddle Period_ "),

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall consult with each other with respect to the allocation of the Aggregate

allocation; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall
prevent a Party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of such allocation, and no
Party shall be required to litigate any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Authority challenging such allocation. Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate on any revisions to the allocation determined pursuant to this

Date or for Straddle Periods for which the Tax Return is due before the
Closing Date, _provided, however_ , that Seller shall provide Buyer with at
least a 15-day (or, in the case of income Tax Returns, 30-day) period prior to
the due date (including any extensions) for filing any such Tax Return to
review and comment on such Tax Return prior to the filing of such Tax Return.

 

(iii) Except in the case of any Tax Return covered by Section 7.18(f)(i),
Buyer shall cause to be prepared at its cost and expense, each Tax Return
required to be filed by Company for a Straddle Period which is due after the

Company. To the extent the amount of Taxes shown to be due on each Tax
Return determined under this Section 7.18(f)(iii) is adjusted under Section
7.18(f)(iv), any adjustment that results in an increase in Taxes for such Tax
Return will be promptly paid to Buyer by Seller, and any adjustment
that results in a decrease in Taxes for such Tax Return will be promptly paid
to Seller by Buyer.

(iv) Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement with
respect to any issue resulting from any review of a Tax Return or
determination described in Section 7.18(f)(ii) or Section 7.18(f)(iii). Should
Buyer and Seller fail to reach such an agreement within 15 days after
delivery of such Tax Return and, if applicable such determination, a
determination with respect to the disputed issues shall be made by the
Independent Accounting Firm, whose decision shall be final and binding upon
the Parties. If the Independent Accounting Firm is unable to resolve any
disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by Buyer and the Taxes (if any) payable by Seller to
Buyer prior to the filing of the Tax Return shall be based on Buyers
determination; provided that, after the Independent Accounting Firms
resolution, Buyer shall pay to Seller or Seller shall pay to Buyer, as
applicable, any amount due the other Party based on the Independent
Accounting Firms resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 

(g) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
such other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns with respect to
the Company and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the request of
the other Party) the provision of records and information that are reasonably

\- 30 -   additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, (i) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters relating to the
Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer
or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (ii) to give such other Party reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
such other Party so requests, Buyer or Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, allow such Party to take possession of such books and records.
Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to use, their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Any information obtained under this Section
7.18(g) or under any other section hereof providing for the sharing of
information or review of any Tax Return will be kept confidential by the
Parties; provided that such information may be provided to a Partys
Affiliates, professional advisors, applicable Taxing Authorities, or as may be

Company or any of their respective Affiliates and attributable to any Pre-

amount of any refund of any Tax received by Seller, Buyer, Company or any of
their respective Affiliates and attributable to any period of the Company that
is not a Pre-Effective Tax Period of the Company shall be for the account of
Buyer. In the case of a Straddle Period of Company, the amount of any refund
received by Seller, Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer in accordance with Section
7.18(d). The amount of any such refund (including any interest thereon) owing
to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, as provided in this Section 7.18(i) shall
be paid by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, within fifteen (15) days after such
refund is received, credited or applied as an offset. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7.18(i), to the extent all or any portion
of any such refund is reflected in the computation of the Net Cash Flow, such
refund or portion thereof shall be for the account of Buyer. 

(j) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest), if any, incurred in connection with

their commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Transfer Taxes, and to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes, that could be imposed on Seller or
Buyer under applicable Law as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another in the preparation of any necessary Tax Returns and other related
documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (including any exemption
certificates and forms) as each may request to establish an exemption from (or
otherwise reduce) or make a report with respect to Transfer Taxes.

(k) Any and all Tax allocation agreements, Tax sharing agreements, Tax
indemnity agreements, intercompany agreements or other similar contracts or
arrangements between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of
Sellers Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, and relating
to any Tax matters shall be terminated with respect to the Company as of the
Closing Date without liability to the Company, and after the Closing Date, the
Company will have no further liabilities thereunder, and any such agreements,
contracts or arrangements will have no further force or effect whatsoever for
any taxable period (whether past, current, or future taxable periods).

 



\- 31 -  (l) Seller and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to
this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes unless
otherwise required by Law.

(m) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of
Sellers and Buyers representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
rights and obligations with respect to any Tax covered by this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall not terminate until sixty (60) calendar days
after the expiration of all statutes of limitations (including any and all
extensions thereof) applicable to such Tax or the assessment thereof.

 

(n) If a Claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority or Indemnified Person
with respect to Taxes, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity
payment pursuant to this Section 7.18, Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
shall promptly notify the other upon receipt of notice of such Claim. Seller
shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the defense of and, at its
sole option, take control of the complete defense or prosecution of, any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes for which Seller
is solely liable pursuant to this Section 7.18 and with respect to
which Seller has acknowledged such liability in writing, including any
settlement or other disposition thereof, and to employ counsel of its choice
at its expense. Buyer shall take or cause to be taken such action in
connection with any such Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding as
Seller shall reasonably request from time to time, including the retention of
counsel and experts as designated by, and at the expense of, Seller and the
execution of powers of attorney or other documentation necessary to evidence
that Seller and its representatives are authorized to represent the Company
and take such actions on behalf of the Company as Seller may determine with
respect to such Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding,
including responding (in writing or otherwise) to any audit inquiry from any
Taxing Authority, attending and conducting interviews, meetings, discussions
and negotiations with any Taxing Authority, negotiating and concluding
compromises, agreements and settlements with any Taxing Authority, lodging
requests for ruling, opinions or determinations with any Taxing Authority or
lodging or instituting objections, applications, appeals and other litigations
with any Taxing Authority, tribunal or court;  _provided, however_ , that in
controlling the conduct of such audit or assessment, the Seller shall: (i)
keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status and progress of such Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding; and (ii) provide to Buyer drafts
of any correspondence to any Taxing Authority and consider in good faith any
comments of Buyer (or its advisors) on the correspondence. No Party may agree
to settle any claim for Taxes for which the other may be liable without the
prior consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(o) In the case of a Claim for Taxes by a Taxing Authority (other than Taxes
arising from a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return) with respect to a
Straddle Period for which both Seller and Buyer potentially have liability
determined based upon Section 7.18(d), (i) Seller and Buyer shall jointly
control the conduct of any defense or prosecution of, any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to such Claim, (ii) each Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
proceeding and (iii) neither Party shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
enter into a settlement with respect to such proceeding or prosecute
such proceeding to a determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or
appellate jurisdiction, without the consent of the other Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however_ , that if the Parties
are unable to mutually agree on whether to settle such a Claim for a Straddle
Period after working in good faith to reach agreement, then the Party that
objects to such settlement may assume the prosecution or defense of the claim
at its own expense, and the Party advocating settlement shall not be liable
for any amount in excess of the amount that would have been paid by such party
had the Claim been settled on the available settlement terms.

 



\- 32 -   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.18(o) to the contrary, Parent
shall retain sole control of any claims by a Taxing Authority that relate to a
Tax Return described in Section 7.18(f)(i).

or Section 12.2 is herein referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ " with
respect to the matter for which it is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified
Person. All claims for indemnification under Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and
Section 12.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) If a third party claim for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2 (an "
_Indemnified Claim_ ") is made against an Indemnified Person, and if Buyer or
Seller intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto by or from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2,
then the Party electing to seek indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified
Person shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("
_Claim Notice_ ") (i) notifying such Indemnifying Party of such Indemnified
Claim and

 



\- 39 -  requesting indemnity on behalf of such Indemnified Person with respect to such
Indemnified Claim under Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2, as the
case may be, (ii) setting forth the full name, address for all notices and the
authorized representatives of such Indemnified Person with respect to
such Indemnified Claim, and (iii) describing in reasonable detail the nature
of the Indemnified Claim, including a copy of all papers served with respect
to such Indemnified Claim (if any) and the basis of such request for
indemnification under Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2, as the
case may be. Failure to provide such Claim Notice promptly shall not affect
the right of the Indemnified Person to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby; provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify or otherwise
hold harmless an Indemnified Person with respect to a third party claim until
a Claim Notice meeting the foregoing requirements is furnished to the
Indemnifying Party by the Party seeking indemnity hereunder. Within thirty
(30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice (the " _Election Period_ ") from a
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Party who sent the Claim
Notice (A) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to
indemnify the Indemnified Person under Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or
Section 12.2, as the case may be, with respect to such third party claim and
(B) whether the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Person
against such third party claim; provided that, if the Indemnifying Party fails
to so notify the Party who sent the Claim Notice during the Election Period,
the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected to dispute such
liability and not to defend against such third party claim.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Party who sent the Claim Notice
within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party (i) does not dispute
its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Person under Section 4.1, Section
12.1 and/or Section 12.2, as the case may be, and (ii) elects to assume the
defense of such Indemnified Person with respect to such third party claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at its sole cost
and expense, such third party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a
final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 12.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
any settlement agreement (or settle or compromise any such third party claim
in a manner) which provides for or results in any payment by or liability of
the Indemnified Person of or for any damages or other amount, any lien,
charge or encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified Person, any finding
of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Person or any
sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified
Person without the Indemnified Persons express written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Person is hereby
authorized, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only
if the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder),
to file, during the Election Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings
which the Indemnified Person shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect
its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and not reasonably expected
to be prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If requested by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Person agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in contesting any such third party claim which the Indemnifying Party elects
to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim or cross-
complaint against any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnified Party, if the
Indemnified Person is a Buyer Indemnified Party, or a Seller Indemnified
Party, if the Indemnified Person is a Seller Indemnified Party). The
Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any third party claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 12.3(b), and the Indemnified Person shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. The prosecution of
the defense of a third party claim with reasonable diligence shall include
the taking of such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or other
security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien
against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Person for payment
of such third party claim.

 



\- 40 -  (c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) fails to notify the Party who sent the Claim
Notice within the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to
defend the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.3(b) or (ii) elects to
defend the Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.3(b) but fails
to prosecute the defense of (or to settle) the third party claim with
reasonable diligence, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if
the Indemnified Person is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder),
the third party claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall
be promptly and vigorously prosecuted by the Indemnified Person to a final
conclusion or settled. The Indemnified Person shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Person may
not enter into any compromise or settlement of such third party claim, without
the Indemnifying Partys express written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Section 12.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

(d) If an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under Section 4.1,
Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2 for a claim or other matter which does not
involve a third party claim, and if Buyer or Seller intends to seek indemnity
on behalf of an Indemnified Person with respect thereto by or from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2,
then the Party electing to seek indemnity on behalf of an Indemnified Person
shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice describing
in reasonable detail the nature of such claim or other matter, the Indemnified
Persons reasonable estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such
claim or other matter and the basis for the Indemnified Persons entitlement
to indemnification under Section 4.1, Section 12.1 and/or Section 12.2, as the
case may be. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Party who sent
such notice within thirty (30) days from its receipt of such notice that the
Indemnifying Party does not dispute such claim for indemnity, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have disputed such claims.

 

Section 12.4 _Seller s General Liability Limitation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this Agreement:

 

(i) In no event shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating

Fundamental Representations) exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of
the Purchase Price; and

(ii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
12.2(B)(2) with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made by

the aggregate amount which would otherwise be payable by Seller thereunder
with respect to all breaches of any such representations and warranties
exceeds an amount equal to two and five tenths percent (2.5%) of the Purchase
Price (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), and in such event, Seller shall be
responsible for only the amount in excess of the Deductible Amount.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary but without in
any way affecting the obligations of Buyer to notify Seller of a third party
claim pursuant to Section 12.3, Seller shall not have any liability to any
Person with respect to any Covered Liability pursuant to Section 12.2(B)
unless and until Buyer enforces any and all of the rights and remedies that
Buyer (or such Buyer Indemnified Party) may have with respect to such Covered
Liability against any other Person pursuant to (i) any insurance maintained
for the joint account under any operating agreement with respect to
the Subject Assets and (ii) any other agreements for insurance,
indemnification, guarantee or similar assurances which may be included in the
Subject Assets.

 



\- 41 -  Section 12.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that
from and after the Closing the indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE XII
are the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and Buyer for the breach of any
representation or warranty or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on

certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and Seller does hereby release, acquit
and forever discharge all Buyer Indemnified Parties and Buyer does hereby
release, acquit, and forever discharge all Seller Indemnified Parties from
any such other remedies; _provided, however_ , that either Party shall be
entitled to pursue all remedies available at Law or in equity (including
specific performance and injunctive relief without the necessity of posting
bond) for any breach by the other Party of the provisions of Section 4.2(b) or
Section 4.2(c), as the case may be.

Section 12.6 _Determination of Damages Related to Breach_. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of determining the
amount of liabilities associated with a breach of any representation or
warranty by any Party hereunder the representations and warranties of such
Party shall, for purposes of this ARTICLE XII, be read without giving effect
to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or qualification with a similar
meaning in such representation or warranty.
