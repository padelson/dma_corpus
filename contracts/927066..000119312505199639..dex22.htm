dispute. Such decision of the Independent Auditor shall be conclusive and
binding as between the Buyer and DaVita, and the costs of such review shall
be borne by both DaVita and the Buyer in proportion to the relevant dollar
amount each of DaVitas and the Buyers determination has been modified.

following the Closing, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, then the Independent Auditor shall review the parties

of default by a Seller (or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, any medical
director) with respect to any such medical director agreement.

it, each Seller has been, and presently is, insured (with certain customary

respect to any such insurance which is on a claims made basis, such insurance
has an extended reporting period (i.e. tail coverage); provided that, DaVita
will, on or prior to the Closing Date, at DaVitas cost, purchase tail
coverage for acts, errors and omissions occurring during the applicable Joint
Ventures ownership of the applicable Center on or prior to the Closing Date.

the Medicare certification of each of the Centers is in full force and effect,

present fairly in all material respects the financial condition and
results of operations of the Business as of the respective dates thereof and

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Schedule 4.16(b)
sets forth the extent to which the Preliminary Financial Statements, the
Financial Statements and any Supplemental Financial Statements are not, and
will not be, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall DaVita or Gambro be
making any representations or warranties under this Section 4.16 with respect
to the Preliminary Financial Statements, the Financial Statements or the
Supplemental Financial Statements for any time periods other than time periods
in 2004 and 2005 (it being understood that the broader definitions of the
Preliminary Financial Statements, the Financial Statements and
the Supplemental Financial Statements are set forth herein so that the Buyer
receives the financial information which it requires for due diligence and
other purposes, including in connection with the Buyers debt financing). The
Financial Statements and the Supplemental Financial Statements, if any, shall
be prepared on a basis that is consistent with the preparation of the
Preliminary Financial Statements and the May 31, 2005 financial statements
provided to the Buyer during its due diligence investigation of the Business.



4.17.  _No Material Liabilities_. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.17
attached hereto and except for the matters, or categories of liabilities,
described on Schedule 4.16(b) (all of which were incurred in the Ordinary
Course of Business), there are no material Liabilities of the Sellers
Relating To the Business, other than (a) Liabilities reflected in the
Preliminary Financial Statements, (b) Liabilities incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) Liabilities that
were incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the date of the most
recent balance sheet included in the Preliminary Financial Statements.



4.18. _Joint Ventures_. Irvine Dialysis Center, LLC and Garey Dialysis Center
Partnership (the "Joint Ventures") are the only indirect subsidiaries of
DaVita that own any of the Centers or Assets in which the Buyer will acquire
the Sellers equity interest. Other than the legal entities listed on
Schedule 4.18(i) attached hereto, no Person, other than a Seller which is a
wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of DaVita or Gambro has any right,
title or interest in any profits, earnings, gains, losses or equity
with respect to the Business, any Center or any Asset. Schedule 4.18(ii)
attached hereto sets forth the authorized, issued and outstanding equity
interests in the Joint Ventures, the equity owners of such equity interests,
and a copy of each Joint Ventures operating agreement or partnership
agreement, as the case may be (collectively, the "Joint Venture Agreements").

and accurate copy of the Joint Venture Agreements. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.18(i), to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no material breach
of or default under the Joint Venture Agreements, and to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, no facts or circumstances exist that with the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both would constitute an event of default by a Seller (or
to the Knowledge of the Sellers, any other party) with respect to the Joint
Venture Agreements. To the Sellers Knowledge, the structure and operation of
the Joint Ventures are in material compliance with all applicable Laws. All
investment interests in the Joint Ventures were offered to the investors on
equivalent investment terms, regardless of the  



 

\- 28 -  ability of any investor to make or influence referrals to or otherwise
generate business for the Joint Ventures. Each Person holding an investment
interest of any kind in the Joint Ventures acquired such interest through a
bona fide capital investment consistent with the fair market value of the
interest acquired. No Seller or Affiliate of any Seller contributed to, loaned
funds for, guaranteed, or otherwise financed any other Persons investment in
the Joint Ventures. All dividends, distributions, or equity returns of any
kind paid or payable to an investor by or on behalf of the Joint Ventures have
been and are directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment of
such investor.

("Material Customers") based on net revenues for each of 2004 and the three
(3) months ended March 31, 2005, and the net revenues associated with each
such Material Customer during such period. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.19(b), to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no Material Customer intends to
terminate or otherwise substantially modify in a manner that is adverse to the
Business its business relationship with any Center in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise, and none of
the Sellers has received any written notification to such effect.



4.20. _Certain Interests_. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.20 attached
hereto, no director, executive officer or other Affiliate of any Seller or, to

Member or Affiliate of any such director, executive officer or medical
director is a party to any Lease or any other Assumed Contract that is a
Material Contract.

number of chronic renal dialysis facilities which are the subject of such
transaction, and (iii) render chronic dialysis treatment at any chronic renal

solicitation efforts or seek such employment unsolicited by the Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers.

breach would be inadequate, and that, accordingly, the Buyer shall be entitled

of the Buyer enjoining the breach or threatened breach of such restrictions
in the event of such breach. The foregoing provision shall not constitute a
waiver of any other remedies the Buyer may have in law or in equity.

such provision, or that the court making such determination shall have the
power to modify such provision, to reduce the duration or area of such
provision or both, or to delete specific words or phrases herefrom ("blue-

provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. In particular, the
parties intend that the covenants contained in Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b)
and Section 6.3(c) above shall be construed as a series of separate covenants,

(g) The Buyer acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 6.3(c)
above are necessary for the protection of the Sellers and that any breach
thereof may cause the Sellers irreparable damage, that the Sellers remedies

accordingly, the Sellers shall be entitled to the issuance by a court of
competent jurisdiction of an injunction in favor of the applicable Seller or
any Affiliate thereof enjoining the breach or threatened breach of such
restrictions in the event of such breach. The foregoing provision shall not
constitute a waiver of any other remedies Sellers or any Affiliate thereof may
have in law or in equity.

into this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without
each of the covenants and agreements of the Buyer set forth herein, including

transaction contemplated by this Agreement as inconsistent with or violative
of any Antitrust Law, each party shall cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist such action, and to have vacated, lifted,

contemplated hereby.



(e) DaVita and Gambro covenant and agree, on behalf of themselves and their
respective Affiliates, that the Sellers shall use their reasonable commercial
efforts to (i) obtain all approvals from third parties to the Assumed
Contracts that are necessary or desirable (or which are otherwise requested by

this Agreement or for the operation of the Business after the Closing Date
and (ii) if such

consent shall have been given or (y) any particular ancillary rights with
respect to an Assumed Contract or other Asset as to which all the remedies for
the enforcement of such ancillary rights enjoyed by the Sellers would not
pass to the Buyer as an incident of the assignments provided for by this
Agreement (provided, however, that no portion of this Section 6.5(f)(y) shall
be interpreted to prevent the conveyance and/or assignment of the underlying
Assumed Contract or Asset to the Buyer at the Closing). Until such consent is
obtained (or until such time as the Buyer enters into a new, direct contract
with the applicable third party), the applicable Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Buyer the benefits of any
such Asset or Assumed Contract (including, without limitation, Sellers
forwarding to the Buyer any moneys received with respect thereto for periods

fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 (the "Audited Financial Statements"). The
Audited Financial Statements shall be prepared on a combined basis, as a
"carve-out" from the operations of DaVita or Gambro, as the case may be, and
shall meet the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Buyer shall bear all costs and expenses
Related To the preparation and delivery of the Audited Financial Statements.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall DaVita or Gambro be deemed to have breached its representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.16 (including as such representations
are modified by the terms of Schedule 4.16(b)) by reason of there being any
differences or variances between, on the one hand, the Preliminary
Financial Statements, the Financial Statements or any Supplemental Financial
Statements contained in Schedules 4.16(a)-1, 4.16(a)-2 and 4.16(a)-3 and, on
the other hand, the Audited Financial Statements for the corresponding
periods, except to the extent that there are differences or variances
exceeding the GAAP Exceptions Threshold (as such term is defined in Schedule
4.16(b)) on account of, on a cumulative basis, the matters described in
subparagraphs (iv), (v), (viii) and (x) of Schedule 4.16(b), between the
annualized year-to-date EBITDA which is yielded from the unaudited income
statements for the five (5) months ending May 31, 2005 which are, on the one
hand, contained in the Financial Statements and, on the other hand, the
annualized 2005 year-to-date EBITDA which is yielded from the Audited
Financial Statements; provided, further, however, if the Buyer determines that
there are errors or omissions contained in the May 31, 2005 year-to-date
Preliminary Financial Statements, the Buyer may use the Audited Financial
Statements for the corresponding period in support of its claim against DaVita
or Gambro. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the Buyer
shall not be permitted to introduce as evidence the Audited Financial
Statements in support of any claim against DaVita or Gambro for periods in
2004. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

the event that the Buyer acquires less than all of the DaVita Centers
or Gambro Centers, the Audited Financial Statements shall reflect the
financial condition and results of operations of only those Centers which are
actually acquired and (ii) in the event the Closing Date occurs on or after
January 1, 2006, (x) the references above in this Section 6.16 to "December
31, 2004" shall be deemed to refer to "December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2005" (and corresponding references to "fiscal year" shall be deemed to refer
to "fiscal years") and (y) the references above in this Section 6.16 to
"January 1, 2005" shall be deemed to refer to "January 1, 2006".

as the case may be, in respect of all Relevant Claims above such threshold

incurred, which shall be reasonably available for inspection by
the Indemnitor. In addition, solely for purposes of determining whether a

circumstances.

Indemnitor under this Article to indemnify, defend and hold harmless one or
more Indemnitees for any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be,

\- 54 -  representations and warranties made in Section 4.2 (Authority Relative to
this Agreement), the third sentence of Section 4.6 (Assets) and Section 5.2
(Authority Relative to this Agreement). It is further understood that the
provisions of Sections 8.4(a) and 8.4(b) above shall not apply to limit any
indemnification to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled for Taxes
regardless of whether or not such Taxes arise out of, are in connection with
or result from a breach of any representation or warranty.



8.5. _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate in the defense of all third
party claims which may give rise to indemnifiable claims hereunder. In
connection with the defense of any claim, each party shall make available to
the party controlling such defense, any books, records or other documents
within its control that are reasonably requested in the course of such
defense. 



8.6. _Bulk Sales Laws_. The parties to this Agreement hereby waive compliance
by the Sellers with the bulk sales Law and any other similar Laws in any
applicable jurisdiction in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except to the extent that any failure to comply with any such Laws
results in the imposition of additional Taxes on either the Buyer or any of
the Sellers. Without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 8.4 above,
DaVita shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, and hold the such
Persons harmless against, any demands, claims, Actions, losses, damages,
Liabilities, penalties, Taxes, costs and expenses resulting from or arising
out of (a) the parties failure to comply with any such Laws in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) any Action brought
or levy made as a result thereof.



ARTICLE IX



MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



9.1.  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing (and
only with respect to Section 9.1(c) below, at any time from the Effective
Date until the date that the FTC Order is made final by the FTC), as follows:



(a) By mutual written consent of the Buyer and DaVita;



(b) By either the Buyer or DaVita, if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred
prior to December 6, 2005 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be
available to the party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before such date, or (ii) the Gambro Purchase Agreement
shall have been terminated. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Termination Date set forth above coincides with the date described in Section
10.01(a) of the Gambro Purchase Agreement. To the extent the parties to the
Gambro Purchase Agreement extend the date described in Section 10.01(a) of the
Gambro Purchase Agreement, DaVita shall provide the Buyer with prompt notice
thereof and the Termination Date shall automatically be amended to be the date
which is the earlier of (I) the date described in Section 10.01(a) of the
Gambro Purchase Agreement as so amended or (II) March 6, 2006;



 

\- 55 - (c) By DaVita, if the FTC notifies any Seller that the Buyer is not an
acceptable acquirer or that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not an acceptable manner of divestiture, in which event this Agreement
shall be void, and in the event such notice is provided after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall return as promptly as possible the Assets to Sellers
and DaVita shall return to the Buyer the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant
to Section 3.1(a), so that Sellers may resell the Assets to an FTC-approved
purchaser.



(d) By either the Buyer or DaVita, if any final and nonappealable Order
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall have been issued by any Governmental Authority or any Law shall have
been enacted or adopted that enjoins, prohibits or makes illegal consummation
of such transactions;



(e) By the Buyer, upon a breach of, or failure to perform in any material
respect (which breach or failure cannot be or has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after the giving of notice of such breach or failure), any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of any Seller set
forth in this Agreement, such that a condition set forth in Section 7.2 would
not be satisfied; or



(f) By DaVita, upon a breach of, or failure to perform in any material respect
(which breach or failure cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30)
days after the giving of notice of such breach or failure), any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer set
forth in this Agreement, such that a condition set forth in Section 7.1 would
not be satisfied.



9.2.  _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either the Buyer or DaVita pursuant to
Section 9.1 (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) hereof, the terminating party shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the nonterminating party. In the event
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement
(other than Article IX hereof) shall be of no further effect, there shall be
no liability under this Agreement on the part of either the Buyer, any Seller
or any Affiliates of any such Person (other than pursuant to Section 9.4) and
all rights and obligations of each party hereto shall cease, provided,
however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the
breach of any of its representations and warranties or the breach of any of
its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.



9.3. _Regulatory Matters_. The Purchase Price to be paid by the Buyer to
DaVita for the purchase of the Assets hereunder has been determined by the
parties through good-faith and arms-length bargaining to be the fair market
value of the Assets. No amount paid by the Buyer to DaVita hereunder is
intended to be, nor shall it be construed to be, an inducement or payment for
referral of patients by DaVita or any Seller to, or purchase of products or
services from, the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof.



9.4. _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each party shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by such
party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including fees, expenses and disbursements of their respective
counsel, accountants, representatives, and investment bankers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Sections 9.1(b)(i) or  



 

\- 56 -  9.1(b)(ii) and the transactions contemplated by the Gambro Purchase
Agreement have not been consummated as a result of facts or circumstances
within DaVitas control, including, without limitation, DaVitas breach of
the Gambro Purchase Agreement, DaVita shall promptly reimburse the Buyer and
its Affiliates for their reasonable documented costs and expenses (including
overhead) incurred by them in connection with the execution of this Agreement
and the activities of the Buyer prior to the termination hereof which
activities are reasonably Related To the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (such amount not to exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000));
provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, DaVita shall
have no obligation to reimburse any such amounts to the Buyer if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement fail to close for any reason
Related To, or arising with respect to, any action or position taken by the
FTC.



9.5. _Merger and Modification_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, expresses the entire agreement between the parties hereto
and supersedes any prior written or oral understanding or agreement.
Covenants and agreements set forth in the schedules to this Agreement shall be
deemed to be covenants and agreements set forth and contained herein. This
Agreement may not be modified, amended, supplemented or waived except by
a writing signed by all of the parties to this Agreement, and such writing
must refer specifically to this Agreement. Any matter disclosed in this
Agreement or in the Schedules hereto with reference to any Section of this
Agreement shall be deemed a disclosure in respect of all sections to which
such disclosure may apply.



9.6. _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of a party to comply with any obligation,
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived only by a written instrument signed by the parties granting such
waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on
behalf of any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this Section 9.6. No failure on the part of any party to exercise or delay in
exercising any right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise preclude any further exercise of such or any other
right.



9.7. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given when delivered by hand or a national over-
night courier service, by facsimile with subsequent telephone
confirmation, or three (3) Business Days after mailing when mailed by

9.8. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
heirs, successors and permitted assigns, and shall not confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that the
Buyer  



 

\- 58 -  may assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder to any
Affiliate of the Buyer, or to any purchaser of the stock of the Buyer or
of substantially all the Assets and Assumed Liabilities. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to relieve or discharge the obligation of any third
person to any party to this Agreement.



9.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
Delaware. All actions and proceedings arising out of or Relating To this
Agreement shall be heard and determined in any court sitting in Delaware, and
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive any
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or
proceeding.



9.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law
that cannot be waived, the parties hereby waive, and covenant that they will
not assert (whether as plaintiff, defendant or otherwise), any right to trial
by jury in any Action arising under or Related To this Agreement, any other
Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
The parties agree that any of them may file a copy of this Section 9.10 with
any Governmental Authority as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and
bargained-for agreement among the parties irrevocably to waive their rights to
trial by jury in any Action arising under or Related To this Agreement, any
other Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
and consent to the trial of any such Action by a judge sitting without a jury.



9.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
the failure of either party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder,
including, without limitation, its failure to take all actions as are
necessary on its part to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will
cause irreparable injury to the other party, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations
hereunder.



9.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.



9.13.  _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The parties agree that this Agreement is
the product of each partys respective efforts, and that it should not be
interpreted in favor of any one party merely because of its efforts in
initially preparing it. Any rule of law or legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguity against the party drafting it shall
have no application to this Agreement and is expressly waived. The provisions
of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner to effect the
intent of the parties.



9.14. _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date, without
further consideration, the Sellers will, at their expense, execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such documents to the Buyer as
the Buyer may reasonably request in order to more  



 

\- 59 -  effectively vest in the Buyer good title to the Assets, including, without
limitation, any documentation necessary to vest in the Buyer good title to
any Assets if it is determined that such Assets are owned by an Affiliate of
DaVita which was not considered a Seller under this Agreement. From time to
time after the Closing Date, without further consideration, the Buyer will, at
the Buyers expense, execute and deliver such documents to the Sellers as the
Sellers may reasonably request in order to consummate the sale of the Assets
and the assumption by the Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this
Agreement. Concurrent with the Closing, (a) the Sellers shall provide the
Buyer with manuals, instructions and specifications sufficient for the Buyer
to access and use (i) the Assets or (ii) any information in the possession of
the Buyer which was previously used by any Seller in the operation of the
Business and (b) the Sellers shall convey to the Buyer the right to use any
Intangible Property licensed to Sellers from a third party Relating To the
operation of the Business (to the extent permitted by the third-party
licensor) if such right is needed for the Business conveyed to the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement and if the Buyer is unable, using commercially
reasonable efforts, to obtain equivalent rights from other third parties
on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.



9.15.  _Remedies_. Unless otherwise stated herein (including, without
limitation, Sections 8.1 and 9.1 above), to the extent permitted by Law, all
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and any related agreements
or documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available under applicable Law.



9.16. _Attorneys  Fees_.



(a) In the event of any Action for the breach of this Agreement or
misrepresentation by any party, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses incurred in such Action.



(b) Attorneys fees incurred in enforcing any judgment in respect of this
Agreement are recoverable as a separate item. The preceding sentence is
intended to be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to
survive any judgment and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, shall not be
deemed merged into any such judgment.



9.17. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental Authority, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement to the extent permitted by Law shall remain in
full force and effect provided that the essential terms and conditions
of this Agreement remain valid, binding and enforceable. In the event of any
such determination, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement to fulfill as closely as possible the original intents and
purposes hereof. To the extent permitted by Law, the parties hereby to the
same extent waive any provision of Law that renders any provision hereof
prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.



9.18. _Third Party Beneficiary_. None of the provisions contained in this
Agreement are intended by the parties, nor shall they be deemed, to confer
any benefit on any Person not a party to this Agreement. The representations
and warranties of DaVita and Gambro contained herein are provided for the
benefit of the Buyer and its successors and permitted assigns in accordance
with Section 9.8, and are not being provided for the benefit of any other
Person  



 

\- 60 -  (which other Person shall include, for this purpose, without limitation, any
shareholder of DaVita).



9.19. _Reference to and Effect on Original Agreement_. This Agreement amends
and restates the Original Agreement in its entirety effective as of the
Effective Date and this Agreement shall be effective with respect to and apply
to any and all rights, interests, duties, obligations or liabilities
whether arising, to be performed or attributable to the period between the
Effective Date and the Execution Date or after the Execution Date (including
any disputes among any of the parties to the Original Agreement or this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof or thereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Exhibits and Schedules delivered in
connection with the Original Agreement are deemed to apply as if delivered in
connection with this Agreement. On and after the Execution Date, each
reference in any Transaction Agreements to this Agreement shall mean and be a
reference to the Original Agreement as amended and restated hereby.
