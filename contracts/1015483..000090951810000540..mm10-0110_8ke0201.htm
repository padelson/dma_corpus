AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 1, 2010 (this
"Agreement"), is among DashNow Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), DashNow Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Dynamex Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in Section 8.11.

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement as a result of which the Company
will become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company, acting upon the unanimous
recommendation of the special committee of the board of directors, has
unanimously (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement and that the
Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company;

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively to enter into this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Greenbriar Equity Fund II, L.P. and Greenbriar Equity Fund II-A,
L.P. (the "Guarantors") are entering into limited guarantees in favor of the
Company (the "Guarantees") with respect to certain obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall thereupon

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").

  

  

SECTION 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. (C.T.D. time) on a date to be specified by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (as such date may be changed as provided
herein, the "Closing Date"), which date shall be no later than the fourth
(4th) business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 200
Crescent Court, Suite 300 Dallas, Texas 75201, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, however,
that in the event that the Closing shall not have occurred by the fourth (4th)
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time) (or, if the Walk-Away Date is fewer than four (4)
business days after the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, on the
Walk-Away Date) pursuant to the terms of this Section 1.2 (including because
the Debt Financing or any alternative financing under Section 5.5 is not
available or has not been obtained), then, subject to the terms of Section
7.3, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to consummate the Closing
or the other Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time
as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to
as the "Effective Time").

  

  

SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
the form of Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto, respectively, shall be the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Dynamex Inc.), until
thereafter amended as provided herein or by applicable Law (subject to Section
5.9 hereof).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of

  

Certificates; Company Stock Options; Other Equity Awards

  

  

SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), or
any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $21.25 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, each such
share of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such share of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2(b), without interest.

  

  

SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to
the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying
Agent as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event
within one (1) business day after the date on which the Effective Time shall
occur). Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying
Agent in accordance with instructions from Parent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial
paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing
solely in a combination of the foregoing.

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five (5) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held
in book-entry form)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by separate stock powers) and shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and the signature on the endorsement
or stock power, as the case may be, shall be guaranteed by an "eligible
guarantor institution," as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the
Exchange Act) and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article II, without interest.

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in the form
required by Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such amount as is sufficient to provide a full indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following the nine (9) month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and
which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the "Code"), or under any provision of state, local
or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

SECTION 2.3 Appraisal Rights.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in
all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Stockholders"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"). At the
Effective Time, (i) the holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to him, her, it or them under
Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right (through
failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock (i) shall no longer be deemed Dissenting Shares and
(ii) shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically into and
become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with Section 2.1, without any interest thereon.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of such
demands and any other instrument served on the Company pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not offer to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

make, agree to make, or make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

SECTION 2.4 Company Stock Options; Other Equity Awards.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that, and shall cause, each option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) that represents
the right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, an "Option") shall
at the Effective Time be cancelled and terminated and converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option
Consideration, if any, for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to
the Option. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration
otherwise payable such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. For purposes of this Agreement, "Option
Consideration" means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock
issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(x) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (y) the
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
issuable under such Option.

  

  

(b) All restrictions and conditions on each share of restricted stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans (the "Company Restricted Stock") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, other than the Company
Restricted Stock set forth in Section 2.4(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, shall immediately lapse as of, and conditioned upon, the occurrence
of the Closing and the Company Restricted Stock shall be converted in
accordance with Section 2.1(c).

  

  

(c) Each performance unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a
"Company Performance Unit") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing, other than the Company Performance Unit set forth in Section 2.4(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall automatically vest in accordance
with the terms of the applicable award agreement and plan document, and be
settled (i) in Company Common Stock effective as of, and conditioned upon, the
occurrence of the Closing and converted in accordance with Section 2.1(c) or
(ii) to the extent permitted thereby, in cash by the Surviving Corporation on
the Closing Date.

  

  

SECTION 2.5 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately equitably
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction.

Representations and Warranties of the Company

  

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that except as
disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") or in (or incorporated by reference in) the Filed Company SEC
Documents (other than any disclosure in the Company SEC Filings (x) set forth
under "Risk Factors" or under the heading "Competition," "Regulation,"
"Safety," "Available Information," "'Safe Harbor' Statement Under The Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act," "Foreign Exchange Exposure," or "Interest
Rate Exposure" or (y) that is not factual information but merely cautionary
language) (it being understood that any matter disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in (or incorporated by reference in) such Company SEC
Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any Section of this
Article III to which the matter relates, to the extent the relevance of such
matter to such section is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure):

  

  

SECTION 3.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is incorporated and has all requisite corporate power and authority
necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, event,
occurrence or effect which has had or would reasonably be expected to (i) have
a material adverse effect on the results of operations, condition (financial
or otherwise), business, assets or liabilities of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than (only for purposes of Section
3.6(b), 3.7 or 6.2(c)) changes, events, occurrences or effects (A) generally
affecting (I) the industry of the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided that
such changes, events, occurrences or effects do not disproportionately affect
such party and its Subsidiaries, or (II) the economy, or financial or capital
markets, in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including changes in
interest or exchange rates, or (B) arising out of, resulting from or
attributable to (I) changes in Law or in generally accepted accounting
principles or in accounting standards, or changes in general legal, regulatory
or political conditions, (II) acts of war, sabotage or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or
terrorism threatened or underway as of the date of this Agreement, (III)
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters, (IV) the
negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with suppliers, distributors,
partners or employees, but expressly not including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers, or any litigation
arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or violation of Law
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (V) any action taken by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or
with Parent's consent, or any failure by the Company to take any action as a
result of the restrictions in Article V, or (VI) any decline in the market
price, or change in trading volume, of the capital stock of the Company or any
failure to meet publicly announced revenue or earnings projections (with
respect to subclause (VI) of this clause (B), it being understood and agreed
that the facts and circumstances giving rise to such change, event, occurrence
or effect that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of Company
Material Adverse Effect may be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a Company Material Adverse Effect); provided, that such changes,
events, occurrences or effects referred to in subclauses (I) - (III) of this
clause (B) do not disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or (only for purposes of Section 3.6(b) or 6.2(c)) (ii) impair in any material
respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Subsidiaries
of the Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all Liens and transfer
restrictions, except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability
as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), and other
applicable securities laws. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock, voting securities or equity interests in any Person.

  

  

(c) The Company has prior to the date of this Agreement delivered to Parent
complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Charter
Documents"), and complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of
its Subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Documents"), in each case as amended to the
date of this Agreement. All such Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary
Documents are in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of their respective provisions. The

stockholders, the board of directors and each committee of the board of
directors of the Company held since January 1, 2008.

stock, voting securities or equity interests) of the Company or any of its

its stockholders is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the
other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the

consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.

Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (with or without the
giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both) (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the Company Charter Documents or any of the Subsidiary Documents
or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals referred to
in Section 3.4 and the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained and the
filings referred to in Section 3.4 are

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

made, (x) conflict with or violate any Law, judgment, writ or injunction of

conflicts or violations as individually and in the aggregate are
inconsequential or (y) violate or constitute a default under or result in or
permit the modification, revocation, cancellation, termination or acceleration
of rights under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or
credit agreement, debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,

obtained, made or given, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and

SECTION 3.5 Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.

  

  

(a) The Company has timely filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
certifications, prospectuses and registration, proxy and other statements with
the SEC since July 31, 2007 (collectively, and in each case including all
exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein, the "Company SEC Documents"). None of the Company's Subsidiaries is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.
As of their respective effective dates (in the

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant
to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC
filing dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, applicable to
such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such
respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the date
of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are
amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except (i) as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or (ii) as permitted by Regulation S-X) and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-
end audit adjustments that are not, in the aggregate, material).

  

  

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the Company's principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of
the Company (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
the Company's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls. The
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company
have timely made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are complete and correct. The management of the Company has
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company's internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended July
31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

  

  

(d) Since July 31, 2007, neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
received any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company SEC
Documents or the internal accounting controls of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including any written or oral complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives to the Company's board of directors or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law enforcement
agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any crime or the
violation or possible violation of any Law. Since July 31, 2007, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
contractor, subcontractor or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other
manner discriminated against an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a).

  

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent, known or unknown, due or to become due, accrued or otherwise, and
whether or not determined or determinable), except (i) liabilities reflected
or reserved against on the audited balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of July 31, 2010 (the "Balance Sheet Date" ) (including the
notes thereto) included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, (ii) current
liabilities incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (iii) liabilities contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Transactions or (iv) liabilities
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Balance Sheet Date and
except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(a) the Company has carried on and operated its businesses in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice;

  

  

(b) there have not been any events, changes or occurrences that, individually
or in the aggregate, have had or are reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; or

  

  

(c) there has not been any action taken by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would have required the consent of Parent under Section 5.2
if such action was taken after the date of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 3.7 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, investigation, legal or administrative proceeding, claim,
suit, arbitration or action ("Action") against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree
imposed (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be imposed) upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, by or before any
Governmental Authority, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 3.8 Compliance With Laws; Permits. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with all laws (including common law), statutes, ordinances,
codes, rules, regulations, decrees and orders of Governmental Authorities
(collectively, "Laws") applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except for such non-compliance as, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all licenses,
franchises, permits, certificates, approvals and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses (collectively, "Permits"), except where the failure to hold the
same, individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would not be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
all Permits in all material respects. Since July 31, 2007, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice to the effect that a
Governmental Authority (a) claimed or alleged that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was not in compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (b) was considering the amendment, termination,
revocation or cancellation of any Permit.

  

  

SECTION 3.9 Information Supplied. The Proxy Statement will not, when filed
with the SEC, on the date it is mailed to stockholders of the Company and at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will on the date of filing comply as to form in all

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

  

  

SECTION 3.10 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) With such exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i)

unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a

its Subsidiaries have been withheld and have been (or will be) duly and timely

Subsidiaries have complied with all material information reporting
requirements.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

SECTION 3.21 Independent Contractors. The Company Contracts with Independent
Contractors and IC Entities comply and have complied in all material respects
with the Federal Leasing Regulations under 49 CFR Part 376 and similar Laws of
Canada or other Governmental Authorities, in each case to the extent
applicable. Except for non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, such Company Contracts constitute bona fide agreements whereby such
Independent Contractors are independent contractors to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are not any disputes, Actions, or charges pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened at law or in equity before any
Governmental Authority that challenge the Company's compliance under any Law
governing the classification of independent contractors, or the work status of
the independent contractors.

  

  

SECTION 3.22 Confidentiality Agreements. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is party to any confidentiality agreement that prohibits the
Company from providing information to Parent in accordance with Section 5.3.

  

  

SECTION 3.23 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Article III,
neither the Company nor any other Person makes any representation or warranty
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective business,
operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives of any documentation, projections, forecasts,
estimates, budgets, prospect information or other information with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing.

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

  

  

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company:

  

  

SECTION 4.1 Organization; Standing. Parent is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware,
and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  

  

SECTION 4.2 Authority; Noncontravention.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform their respective
obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, have been duly
authorized and approved by their respective boards of directors, and no other
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub is necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and the consummation by them of the Transactions. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger
Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

  

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Transactions, nor
performance or compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of
time, or both) (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) assuming that the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in Section 4.3 are obtained
and the filings referred to in Section 4.3 are made, (x) conflict with or
violate any Law, judgment, writ or injunction of any Governmental Authority
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of their
assets are subject, or (y) violate or constitute a default under or result in
or permit the modification, revocation, cancellation, termination or
acceleration of rights under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their assets are bound, except, in
the case of clause (ii)(y), for such violations or defaults as, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to impair in any
material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

SECTION 4.3 Governmental Approvals. Except for (a) any filings required under,
and in compliance with other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act and
the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, (b) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the
DGCL and (c) any filings required under, and in compliance with other
applicable requirements of, the HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws, no
consents or approvals of, or filings, licenses, permits or authorizations,
declarations or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary
for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions,
other than such other consents, approvals, filings, licenses, permits or
authorizations, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or
given, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform
its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 4.4 Information Supplied. The information supplied by Parent expressly
for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will not,
on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

  

SECTION 4.5 Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub. Parent owns beneficially
and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged
in no other business.

  

  

SECTION 4.6 Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (a) executed commitment
letters (the "Equity Funding Letters"), dated as of the date of this
Agreement, from certain parties (the "Equity Providers") to provide, subject
to the terms and conditions therein, equity financing in the aggregate amounts
set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the "Equity Financing"),
and (b) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
from the financial institutions identified therein (the "Debt Commitment
Letter" and, together with the Equity Funding Letters, the "Financing
Letters") to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt
financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the "Debt Financing", and together with the Equity Financing
collectively referred to as the "Financing"). As of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Equity Funding Letters nor Debt Commitment Letter has
been amended or modified and the respective commitments contained in such
letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Merger
Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection
with the Equity Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter that are
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Assuming the Financing is
funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Financing Letters
and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III (without giving effect to any qualifications as to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

"materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" or another similar
qualifier) and performance by the Company of its obligations under Section
5.3, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters and Debt
Commitment Letter will, together with the cash or cash equivalents available
to the Company, in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to consummate the Transactions upon the terms and
conditions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of Parent, as of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any
representation regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the representations
and warranties in Article III. The Financing Letters contain all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein.

  

  

SECTION 4.7 Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. To the knowledge of Parent, based on information available
to Parent as of the date of this Agreement, immediately after giving effect to
all of the Transactions, including the Financing, and the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration and any other repayment or refinancing of debt
that may be contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, assuming (a)
satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger
as set forth herein, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Section 3.5(b) and Section 3.5(f) (without, in the
case of such Section 3.5(f), giving effect to any qualifications as to
"Company Material Adverse Effect"), (c) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, (d) the
financial and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
provided to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 5.5(b) fairly presents
the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at
the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
and (e) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were
and continue to be reasonable, the Surviving Corporation (i) as of such date
will be able to pay its debts as they become due and shall own property having
a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities)
as they become absolute and mature; and (ii) shall not have, as of such date,
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business.

  

  

SECTION 4.8 Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantees. Each
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Guarantor thereunder (subject to the exceptions set forth
therein), and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under
such Guarantee.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

SECTION 4.9 Certain Arrangements. There are no Contracts between Parent,
Merger Sub or the Guarantors, on the one hand, and any member of the Company's
management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date of this Agreement
that relate in any way to the Company or the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 4.10 Legal Proceedings. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened, Action against Parent or Merger Sub, nor is there any
injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree imposed (or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened to be imposed) upon Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, by
or before any Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 4.11 Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries except for Persons whose fees and expenses will be paid by
Parent or its Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 4.12 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Article
IV, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any other Person makes any
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any documentation,
projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets, prospect information or other
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in any
event within twenty (20) business days after the date of this Agreement), (i)
the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, (ii) Parent shall promptly
provide to the Company any information required for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement and shall promptly provide such other information or assistance in

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

comments or requests or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand. In the event that the

the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement,
Parent shall promptly provide to the Company, upon receipt of notice from the
Company, any information required for inclusion in the response of the Company
to such comments or such request and shall promptly provide such other
information or assistance in the preparation thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
(x) provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
drafts of the Proxy Statement and related correspondence and filings and (y)
reasonably consider all comments proposed by Parent for inclusion in such
drafts, correspondence and filings. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any fact or information relating to the Company shall be discovered by the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Company shall, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 5.1(a), prepare and file with the SEC
such amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable
and to the extent required by applicable Law, cause such amendment or
supplement to be distributed to the stockholders of the Company.

  

  

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date that the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall, through its board of directors, recommend to its
stockholders adoption of this Agreement. The Proxy Statement shall, in

obligation to do any of the foregoing if there shall have been a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) the Company may adjourn or postpone the

Company's stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

meeting; provided that no adjournment may be to a date on or after five (5)
business days prior to the Walk-Away Date.

Agreement or as required by applicable Law or as contemplated by Section 5.2

12:01 p.m. (New York City time) on the fortieth (40th) day following the date
of this Agreement (the "No-Shop Period Start Date"), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants,
agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") shall have the right to: (i) initiate, solicit and
encourage Takeover Proposals (as defined herein) (or inquiries, proposals or
offers or other efforts or attempts that are reasonably expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal), including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements (as defined herein); provided that the Company
shall promptly (and, in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to
Parent any material non-public information provided orally and any non-public
information provided in writing, in each case, concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not
previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and (ii) enter into,
engage in, and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Takeover
Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or

Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each party
(including any Excluded Party) that submitted a Takeover Proposal prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement" means any confidentiality and standstill agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.3, the Company shall and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, on the No-Shop Period Start
Date, (i) immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal and with any Persons who have made or indicated an intention to make
a Takeover Proposal, and (ii) request each such Person to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this Section 5.3, the Company shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from the
No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, directly or
indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other party information in connection with or for
the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, a Takeover Proposal, (C) approve,
endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal, (D) enter into any letter of
intent, agreement or agreement in principle or other Contract with respect to
a Takeover Proposal, or (E) propose to do any of the foregoing. The parties

under this Section 5.3 on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may
continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.3(a)(ii) with
respect to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal submitted by an Excluded
Party prior to

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of such time as such Excluded
Party ceases to be an Excluded Party and such time as the Company Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained (the earlier of the date upon which such
Excluded Parties cease to be Excluded Parties and the date the Company
Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, the "Cut-off Date") including
with respect to any amended or revised proposal submitted by such Excluded
Party on or before the Cut-off Date; provided, however, that the Company may
continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.3(a)(ii) with
respect to such a bona fide written Takeover Proposal submitted by an Excluded
Party prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date only for so long as the Company's
board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with
nationally-recognized independent financial advisors and nationally-recognized
outside legal counsel, that (x) failure to take such action would violate the
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable
Laws and (y) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time
on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal from any Person, which
Takeover Proposal was made or renewed on or after the No-Shop Period Start
Date and that did not result from any breach of this Section 5.3, if the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
nationally-recognized independent financial advisors and nationally-recognized
outside legal counsel, that (i) failure to take such action would violate the
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law
and (ii) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover
Proposal; provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information
provided orally and any non-public information provided in writing, in each
case, concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives; and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover
Proposal; provided, further that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) the identity of the Person
making the Takeover Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall not grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill
agreement without the prior written consent of Parent.

  

  

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Takeover Proposal (whether made before or after the No-Shop
Period Start Date) on a current basis (and in any event within seventy-two
(72) hours during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
ending on the No-Shop Period Start

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Date and within twenty-four (24) hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date)
and shall, from and after the date of this Agreement, promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent (i) a written summary
of the terms of any such Takeover Proposal not made in writing (other than
terms that are, individually and in the aggregate, inconsequential) and (ii)
copies of any written materials provided by any Person(s) making a Takeover
Proposal (including a copy of any Takeover Proposal made in writing). The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this Section 5.3.

  

  

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3(e), the board of
directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) fail to make the Company Board
Recommendation or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) take any formal
action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of directors
of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (D) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal (actions described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"),
(ii) subject to the compliance by the Company with Section 7.1(d)(ii),
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle or other
Contract with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") or (iii)
take any action pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, but not after, the board of directors of the Company may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking
such action, the board of directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with nationally-recognized independent financial
advisors and nationally-recognized outside legal counsel, (i) that failure to
take such action would violate the directors' fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law and (ii) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that (w) the
Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days' prior written notice
of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Proposal), (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guarantee such that
it would cause such Superior Proposal

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (y) following the end of such
notice period, the board of directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the
Guarantee proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect, and (z) in the event of any change to the
terms of such Superior Proposal (other than changes that are, individually and
in the aggregate, inconsequential), the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice and the four (4) business day notice
period shall have recommenced unless the event requiring notice pursuant to
clause (z) of this Section 5.3(e) occurred less than four (4) business days
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall
deliver notice to Parent of such event as promptly as practicable; and
provided, further, that the Company has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Section 5.3 and provided, further, that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any purported
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of
no force and effect, unless the Company termination is in accordance with
Section 7.1 and the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 7.3 prior to or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

(f) Except to the extent provided in Section 5.3(e), nothing in this Section
5.3 shall prohibit the board of directors of the Company from taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate applicable Law.

  

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, any (i) acquisition of assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries equal to more than 20% of the Company's consolidated
assets or to which more than 20% of the Company's revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (ii) acquisition of more than 20% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning more than 20% of
the outstanding Company Common Stock, (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or (v) any combination of the
foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated
assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common Stock involved is
more than 20%; in each case, other than the Transactions.

  

  

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Takeover Proposal (i) that
includes consideration per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than
the per share Merger Consideration and that the board of directors of the
Company has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
nationally-recognized

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

independent financial advisors and nationally-recognized outside legal
counsel) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms
without unreasonable delay, taking into account all legal, regulatory and
financial aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise) and (ii)
accompanied by executed customary financing commitments from recognized
financing sources not subject to any due diligence conditions and that,
together with available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund the cash portion
of such Takeover Proposal; provided that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

  

  

"Excluded Party" means any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or
"group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (so long as
such Person and the other members of such group, if any, who were members of
such group immediately prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date constitute more
than two-thirds of the equity financing of such group at all times following
the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement),
from whom the Company or any of its Representatives has received a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to
the No-Shop Period Start Date that, on or before the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with nationally-recognized independent financial advisors and
nationally-recognized outside legal counsel, constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal has not
been rejected or withdrawn as of the No-Shop Period Start Date. Further, on
the No-Shop Period Start Date, in addition to the information required to be
provided pursuant to this Section 5.3, the Company shall identify for Parent
which Persons submitting Takeover Proposals have been determined by the board
of directors of the Company to be an Excluded Party and a summary of the
reasons for such determination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 5.3 to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded
Party for all purposes under this Agreement upon such time as such Takeover
Proposal made by such party is withdrawn, terminated, expires or no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  

  

SECTION 5.4 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), and (ii) obtain all

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

approvals, consents, expirations of waiting periods, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions. For
purposes hereof, "Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five (5) business days of the date of this
Agreement and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
(including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable and (ii) the Company
and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
in this Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to
(and in no event shall any representation, warranty or covenant or agreement
of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement be inaccurate or breached
or deemed inaccurate or breached as a result of the failure of Parent or
Merger Sub to): (1) agree to or otherwise become subject to any limitations on
(A) the right of Parent effectively to control or operate its business
(including the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or assets
(including the assets of the Company), (B) the right of Parent to acquire the
Company pursuant to the Merger, or (C) the right of Parent to exercise full
rights of ownership of its business (including the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries) or assets (including the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), (2) agree or be required to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of all
or any portion of the business, assets or operations of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of the
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (3) otherwise take any steps to
avoid or eliminate any impediment that may be asserted under any Law governing
competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and in

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Authority relating to the Transactions, including any Action initiated by a
private party, and to contest and resist any Action by or before a
Governmental Authority (including any Action contemplated in Section 5.10) and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any Action by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions. Parent shall pay all fees associated with the filings
made by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with this Section
5.4.

  

  

SECTION 5.5 Financing.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters and
shall not permit any amendment, modification or replacement of the Financing
Letters, if such amendment, modification or replacement (x) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing or (y) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or
prevent the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Financing Letters or the definitive documents with respect thereto in each
of clauses (i) and (ii) in any material respect. Parent shall deliver to the
Company copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement (but not any
related fee letter or amendment, modification or replacement thereto). For
purposes of this Section 5.5, references to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a) and references to "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified or
replaced by this Section 5.5(a). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) to satisfy all conditions to funding in the
Debt Commitment Letter applicable to it that are within its control and
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iii) to enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and provide to the Company copies of the material definitive
documents for the Financing. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, (A) Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company and (B)
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions no less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates)
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letters as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative
financing, is not a condition to Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Section 5.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to amend or waive any of the terms or
conditions hereof. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.5 or
in any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the
Company prompt written notice: (i) of any material breach or default by any
party to any Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing
of any provisions of the Financing Letters; (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any financing source with respect
to any: (A) material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any Financing Letters of any provisions of the Financing Letters or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Letters; and (iii) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it is reasonably likely that it will not be able to obtain all or
any material portion of the Financing in the amounts or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Letters and that it is not reasonably likely
that it will be able to obtain acceptable alternative financing; provided,
that Parent and Merger Sub shall be under no obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar privilege or if
such disclosure would violate any Law.

  

  

(b) The Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub and all cooperation that is
customary, necessary or advisable in connection with arranging and obtaining
of the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing (collectively with the Financing, the "Available
Financing)" and the other Transactions (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) assisting with the preparation of
offering and syndication documents and materials, including prospectuses,
private placement memoranda, information memoranda and packages, lender and
investor presentations, rating agency presentations, and similar documents and
materials, in connection with the Available Financing (all such documents and
materials, collectively, the "Offering Documents" ), (ii) preparing and
furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their financing sources as promptly as
practicable with all financial and other information and disclosures relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including their businesses,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

operations, financial projections and prospects) as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or Merger Sub to assist in preparation of the Offering
Documents (including execution of customary authorization and management
representation letters and certificates), (iii) participating in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Available Financing, including direct contact between senior management and
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent's and Merger
Sub's financing sources and potential lenders and investors in the Available
Financing, and obtaining any corporate, credit and ratings from rating
agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) obtaining
accountant's comfort letters and consents from the Company's independent
auditors, (v) assisting Parent with the preparation of definitive financing
documents, including guarantee and collateral documents, hedging agreements
and other certificates and documents as may be requested by Parent or Merger
Sub, (vi) facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Available Financing,
including taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the
financing sources of the Available Financing to evaluate the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' real property and current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements in connection
with the Available Financing, (vii) using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Available
Financing and collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters,
lien releases and instruments of termination or discharge, and (viii)
facilitating the consummation of the Financing, including cooperating with
Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Financing to
the extent within the control of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and taking
all actions reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to permit the
consummation of the Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available immediately at the Effective Time; provided, however, that, no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate,
document or instrument (other than the authorization and representation
letters and certificates referred to above) shall be effective until the
Effective Time and, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Available Financing prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 5.5(b) (it is understood and agreed that nothing
herein shall require Parent to pay for any attorneys' fees incurred to review
documents that would not by their terms become effective at or after the
Effective Time) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used
in connection therewith, except with respect to any information prepared or
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

material non-public information provided by the Company or any of its
Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.5(b) shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger
Sub shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential sources of
capital, rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during
syndication of the Available Financing subject to the potential sources of
capital, ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors entering into
customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information
(including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in
confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities).

  

  

SECTION 5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to
make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party).

  

  

SECTION 5.7 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic
form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) such other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (provided that Parent and its representatives
shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company). Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of April 7, 2010, between the Company and Greenbriar Equity Group LLC (as it
may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement" ), Parent
and its representatives shall hold information received from the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.7 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any
Actions commenced or, to such party's knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to the Transactions, (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause any
representation or warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement (i)
that is qualified as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or
"material adverse effect" or a similar qualifier, as the case may be, to be
untrue and (ii) that is no so qualified to be untrue in any material respect
and (d) any material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.8 shall not (x) cure any in accuracy or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or (y) limit the remedies
available to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

SECTION 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time shall occur or, if longer,
until all claims for indemnification in respect of any claims made prior to
the end of such six (6) year period shall have been finally resolved,
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "Indemnitee" and,
collectively, the "Indemnitees" ) with respect to all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions
by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (x) the
Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall survive
the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms for a period of at least six (6) years. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, from and after the Effective Time and
until the sixth (6th)

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time shall occur or, if longer,
until all claims for indemnification in respect of any claims made prior to
the end of such six (6) year period shall have been finally resolved, cause
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time and until the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time shall occur
or, if longer, until all claims for indemnification in respect of any claims
made prior to the end of such six (6) year period shall have been finally
resolved, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to, advance any expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses
of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.9 (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this Section 5.9) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) At the Company's election, (i) the Company shall obtain prior to the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time with respect to the directors' and officers'
liability insurance in amount and scope no less favorable than the existing
policy of the Company for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or prior to the Effective Time at a cost that does not exceed 250% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for DandO Insurance (as defined
below); or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
the Indemnitees who are insured under the Company's directors' and officers'
insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance" ) that is no less favorable, taken as a
whole, than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided,
however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an aggregate amount for the DandO Insurance during such six (6) year period
in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.9.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnitee
on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of
this Section 5.9 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Action.

  

  

SECTION 5.10 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
consent.

  

  

SECTION 5.11 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

  

  

SECTION 5.12 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 5.13 Employee Matters. Parent shall, for a period of six (6) months
immediately following the Closing Date, cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Company Employees" ) during their employment with (x) the same level of base
salary as in effect on the Closing Date and (y) employee benefit plans,
programs, contracts and arrangements, other than equity-based plans, that are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, than similar employee benefit plans,
programs, contracts and arrangements provided by the Company and its
subsidiaries to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date. Parent or one of
its Affiliates shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the
Company prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its affiliates in
connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k) savings plan, welfare
benefit plans and policies (including vacations and holiday policies)
maintained by Parent or one of its

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent or one
of its Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and
benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals other than in the case of
severance pay and vacation entitlement), except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits or is prohibited under Law. Parent
shall (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as
to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under any welfare
benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to
Company Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its
affiliates to the same extent as under any similar type of welfare benefit
plan applicable to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
provide credit to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries during the
portion of the relevant plan year including the Closing Date. The provisions
of this Section 5.13 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no other
Person, including any current or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their dependents or beneficiaries shall be regarded as
a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.13. No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed as amending any Company Plan or as limiting the ability of
the Company, Parent or any Affiliate of either to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee or the service of any Independent Contractor or to amend
or terminate any Company Plan.

signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief
financial officer of the Company to such effect;

  

  

(b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company shall have

Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (or, if given as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except

Agreement or prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the
chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of Parent to such
effect; and

cannot be cured by Parent by the earlier of (x) twenty (20) calendar days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or failure
or (y) the Walk-Away Date; or

  

  

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to
concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, if, (A) the Company has (without giving effect to any
materiality qualifiers set forth in Section 5.3) complied in all material
respects with the requirements of Section 5.3 and (B) prior to or concurrently
with such termination, the Company pays the fee due under Section 7.3 (as

the

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Closing) have been satisfied or waived, (B) Parent fails to consummate the

Away Date is fewer than four (4) business days after the date on which such

void (other than Sections 7.2 and 7.3, Article VIII, the expense reimbursement
and, other than following a termination by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), indemnification
provisions of Section 5.5(b) and the Confidentiality Agreement and Guarantee
in accordance with their respective terms, all of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, except (a) the Company or Parent may have
liability as provided in Section 7.3, and (b) subject to Section 7.3(a)(i),
Section 7.3(a)(iii) and Section 7.3(b)(ii), nothing shall relieve any party
from liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 7.3 Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that:

  

  

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made, proposed or communicated,
after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there
has been no Company Stockholders Meeting, and (B) following the occurrence of
an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated
by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii)
or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (C) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any Takeover
Proposal is consummated, in either case within one (1) year after the date
this Agreement; provided that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section
7.3(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"; or

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii); or

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii);

  

  

then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
7.3(a), the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the Termination Fee (as
defined below), by wire transfer of immediately available funds (x) in the
case of Section 7.3(a)(iii), within two (2) business days after such
termination, (y) prior to or currently with such termination if pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii), or (z) in the case of Section 7.3(a)(i), two (2) business
days after the earlier of the entry into a Company Acquisition Agreement or
the consummation of a Takeover Proposal; it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. As used herein, "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to
$6,298,475 (the "No-Shop Termination Fee" ), except in the event that this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) in order
to enter into prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date a definitive agreement
with respect to a Takeover Proposal, the Termination Fee shall mean a cash
amount equal to $4,198,983 (the "Go-Shop Termination Fee"). Parent's receipt
of full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall
not relieve the Company of liability for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination in
the event of any willful and material breach by the Company of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(i) or Section 7.1(d)(iii), then:

  

  

(i) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or, subject to
Section 7.3(b)(ii), Section 7.1(d)(iii), if at such time, the Company is not
in material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set forth
in Section 6.2 not being satisfied and all conditions to Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger shall have been satisfied, then
Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $12,596,950 in cash;

  

  

(ii) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii), if (A) the
Debt Financing or any alternative debt financing under Section 5.5 is not
available to Parent or Merger Sub under the Debt Financing Commitments for any
reason other than as the result of the failure of Affiliates of Parent to fund
the Equity Financing and (B) at such time, the Company is not in material
breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
6.2 not being satisfied and all conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the Merger shall have been satisfied, then Parent
shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $7,873,094 in cash; or

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

(such payment, as applicable, the "Parent Termination Fee"), such payment to
be made by wire transfer of same day funds within two (2) business days after
the termination of this Agreement; it being understood that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. In the event that the Company shall receive full payment pursuant to
this Section 7.3(b), the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of, the Company or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the
Guarantee (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming
the basis for such termination, and neither the Company nor any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against Parent or Merger Sub
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letter or
the Guarantee, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain the
payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the other party for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.3, such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received.

representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate
at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, upon
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be,
except that the agreements set forth in Article II and Sections 5.9, 5.11, and

directors; provided,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54

contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such

Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by

doubt and without limitation of the rights of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation from and after the Effective Time, Parent may (and, following the
Effective Time, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to) collaterally
assign, without the consent of any other party hereto, all of their respective
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including their rights under
covenants, representations, warranties and indemnities) to an Affiliate, to
any and all lenders or other financing sources to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation or to any Person who acquires all or substantially all of any of
their respective properties or assets. Subject to the preceding sentence, this

by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and
void.

one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties.
