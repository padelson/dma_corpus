the amount of any such Post-Closing Payment, determined by the Shareholders'
Agent to be correct to Purchaser during either the Initial Response Period or
the Final Response Period in accordance with this Section 1.4(f), and if the
Shareholders' Agent and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the calculation of
the amounts set forth in the 2004/5 Statement within 30 days after such Initial
Objection Notice or Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, is delivered to
Purchaser, the dispute shall be finally settled by a U.S. nationally recognized
independent accounting firm jointly selected by Purchaser and the Shareholders'

during the 5-year period prior to its selection (the "<B>Accounting
Referee</B>"). The determination by the Accounting Referee of the disputed

Schedule, as of the Accounts Date, the Acquired Companies have no liability in
respect of Tax (whether actual or contingent) that is not fully provided for in
the Accounts. The amount of the deferred tax provision contained in the Accounts
was adequate as at the Accounts Date, the making and calculation of such
provision was fully in accordance with relevant generally accepted accountancy
practice as at the Accounts Date and the Company has not subsequently become
aware of any reason why the deferred tax provision contained in the Accounts may

arise only from trading income of the Acquired Companies in the ordinary course
of business. </LI></P>

the Acquired Companies have been involved in any transaction for which any tax
clearance has been sought or obtained or could have been sought or obtained;
(iii) none of the Acquired Companies has declared, made or paid any distribution
within the meaning of TCA; (iv) there has been no disposal of any asset
(including trading stock) or supply of any service or business facility of any
kind (including a loan of money or the letting, hiring or licensing of any
property whether tangible or intangible) in circumstances where the
consideration actually received or receivable for such disposal or supply was
less than the consideration which could be deemed to have been received for tax
purposes; (v) no event has occurred which will or may give rise to a liability
to taxation on any of the Acquired Companies where such liability would be
computed by reference to deemed income, profits or gains or which will or may
give rise to a liability to taxation on any of the Acquired Companies where such
liability is directly or primarily chargeable against or attributable to another
person, firm or company; (vi) none of the Acquired Companies have received any
notice from any tax, revenue or fiscal authority which required or will or may
require any of the Acquired Companies to withhold tax from any payment actually
made since the Accounts Date or which is likely to be or may be made after the
Closing Date; and (vii) none of the Acquired Companies have made any payment or
become obliged to make any payment which will not be deductible when calculating
trading profits for the purposes of corporation tax.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no dispute, disagreement, claim or Legal
Proceeding outstanding with respect to any of the Acquired Companies in respect
of any Tax and no such dispute, disagreement, claim or Legal Proceeding is
expected or contemplated or likely to commence regarding any liability or
potential liability to any Tax or regarding the availability of any relief from
Tax. There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of any of the Acquired
Companies. No Acquired Company Return relating to Taxes has ever been examined
or audited by any Governmental Body. Except as set forth in Part 2.15(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Companies is, or has been, a party to
or bound by any tax indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation
agreement or similar agreement.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the Acquired Companies is resident for tax
purposes in its country of incorporation, has not been at any time resident for
tax purposes in any jurisdiction other than or in addition to its country of
incorporation, has never carried on any trade in any other country, (whether
through a branch, agency, permanent establishment or otherwise) other than its
country of incorporation, and has not at any time paid tax on income, profits or
gains to any tax, revenue or fiscal authority in any other country except its
country of incorporation.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except as set forth in Part 2.15(f) of the Disclosure

Acquired Companies or which affords any right or rights to any of the Acquired
Companies has been duly and properly stamped and none of the Acquired Companies
has any outstanding liability for stamp duty or capital duty or other similar
tax or interest or penalties relating to stamp duty or capital duty. None of the
Acquired Companies has been involved in any transaction involving any instrument
in relation to which a claim for exemption from stamp duty or other similar tax
was made.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except as set forth in Part 2.15(g) of the Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Acquired Companies have sufficient and proper records
relating to past events, including any claims or elections made to calculate the
tax liability or relief that would arise on any disposal or on the realization
of any asset owned by any of the Acquired Companies at the Accounts Date or
acquired by any of the Acquired Companies since the Accounts Date but before the
Closing Date. In the seven years prior to the Accounts Date the amount of any
tax liability of any of the Acquired Companies has not, to any material extent,
depended on any arrangement or concession (in either case whether formal or
informal) with any tax, revenue or fiscal authority. Each of the Acquired
Companies are in material compliance with all terms and conditions of any tax
exemptions, claims, elections or reliefs they have applied for or obtained from
any tax, revenue or fiscal authority and the execution of this agreement will
not have any adverse effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any
such tax exemptions, claims, elections or reliefs.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except as set forth in Part 2.15(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule, if each asset owned by the Acquired Companies at the Accounts Date was
disposed of by the relevant Acquired Company for a consideration equal to the
value attributed to that asset in preparing the Accounts then the tax liability
arising to the relevant Acquired Company in respect of the disposal of the
relevant asset would not be greater than the amount taken into account in
respect of that asset in calculating any provision for tax as set out in the
Accounts. Except as set forth in Part 2.15(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, if
each asset acquired by the relevant Acquired Company since the Accounts Date was
disposed of for a consideration equal to the consideration paid by the relevant
Acquired Company on acquisition then no tax liability would arise to the
relevant Acquired Company in respect of the disposal of that asset.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of all dividends paid, the Acquired Companies
have fully and correctly complied with the provisions of Chapter 8A of Part 6
TCA or other comparable foreign provision, and have deducted and accounted for
all appropriate dividend withholding tax and have no outstanding liability in
respect of dividend withholding tax. In respect of all dividends paid by any of
the Acquired Companies, which were exempt from dividend withholding tax, such
Acquired Company has received a declaration, in the form prescribed in Schedule
2A to TCA or other comparable foreign provision, from the recipients of such
dividends, evidencing that dividend withholding tax was not payable. </LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is the beneficial owner of all of the shares
in its Subsidiaries and any profit on the sale of such shares by the Company
would not give rise to a trading receipt. There is no reason why each Acquired
Company would not be treated as a member of the same group of companies as the
other members for the purposes of Chapter 5 Part 12 TCA or other comparable
foreign provision. None of the Acquired Companies have made a claim for group
relief or a surrender of group relief or advance corporation tax to a company
that is not a member of the same group and none of the Acquired Companies has
received payment in respect of any surrender of group relief or advance
corporation tax which may be due to be repaid to any company that is not a
member of the same group. In the eleven years prior to the date of this
agreement none of the Acquired Companies have acquired from any other company
any asset in circumstances where the companies were, at the time of the
acquisition, members of the same group of companies for tax purposes.</LI></P>
<LI><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except as set forth in Part 2.15(k) of the Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Acquired Companies have been involved in any tax avoidance
transaction within the meaning of Section 811 TCA or other comparable foreign
provision. The trade carried on by each of the Acquired Companies has not at any
time qualified for relief under Part 14 TCA or other comparable foreign
provision.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&#9;If any Indemnitee has or claims to have incurred or
suffered Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under Section 6 of the Agreement, such Indemnitee
may deliver a notice of claim (a "<B>Notice of Claim</B>") to the Shareholders'
Agent. Each Notice of Claim shall (a) state that such Indemnitee believes that
that there is or has been a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
contained in the Agreement or that such Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section&nbsp;6 of the
Agreement, (b) contain a brief description of the circumstances supporting such
Indemnitee's belief that there is or has been such a possible breach or that
such Indemnitee is so entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, and (c) if practicable, contain a good faith, non-binding,
preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of actual and potential
Damages that have arisen and may arise as a result of such breach or other
matter as set forth on such Notice of Claim (the "<B>Claimed Amount</B>").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&#9;Within 30 days after receipt by the Shareholders' Agent
of a Notice of Claim (the "<B>Dispute Period</B>"), the Shareholders' Agent may
deliver to the Indemnitee who delivered the Notice of Claim a written response
(the "<B>Response Notice</B>") in which the Shareholders' Agent: (i)&nbsp;agrees
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part,
but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "<B>Agreed Amount</B>") is owed to the
Indemnitee; or (iii)&nbsp;indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owing
to the Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owing
to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice shall be the "<B>Contested
Amount</B>." If a Response Notice is not received by the Indemnitee prior to the
expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Shareholders' Agent shall be
conclusively deemed to have agreed that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;If (a) the Shareholders' Agent delivers a Response
Notice agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, or (b)
the Shareholders' Agent does not deliver a Response Notice on a timely basis in
accordance with paragraph 2 above, the Indemnitors shall, within 10 days
following the receipt of such Response Notice (or, if the Indemnitee has not
received a Response Notice, within 10 days following the expiration of the
Dispute Period referred to in paragraph 2 above), pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnitee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.&#9;If the Shareholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice
agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, the
Indemnitors shall, within 10 days following the receipt of such Response Notice,
pay the Agreed Amount to such Indemnitee. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;If the Shareholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice
indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Shareholders' Agent and the
Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the
Contested Amount. If the Indemnitee and the Shareholders' Agent resolve such
dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the Shareholders' Agent, the
Indemnitors and such Indemnitee and a settlement agreement shall be signed by
such Indemnitee and the Shareholders' Agent. The Indemnitors shall, within 10
days following the execution of such settlement agreement, or such shorter
period as may be set forth in the settlement agreement, pay the amount specified
in such settlement agreement to such Indemnitee.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.&#9;If the Shareholders' Agent and the Indemnitee are
unable to resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount within 30 days
after the delivery of the Notice of Claim (the "<B>Initial Resolution
Period</B>"), then either the Indemnitee or the Shareholders' Agent may submit
the claim described in the Notice of Claim to arbitration to be settled by
binding arbitration in Dublin in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration and
Conciliation of the International Chamber of Commerce, Paris. The number of
arbitrators shall be three, one selected by Purchaser, one selected by the
Shareholders' Agent, and the third selected by the first two arbitrators. If
either Purchaser or the Shareholders' Agent fails to select an arbitrator within
10 days following the submission of the dispute to arbitration, then the other
shall be entitled to select the second arbitrator. The parties agree to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 75
days after the appointment of the mutually-selected arbitrator or the last of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, and to use all reasonable efforts to
cause the decision of the arbitrator(s) to be furnished within 90 days after the
appointment of the mutually-selected arbitrator or the last of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be. The parties further agree that discovery shall
be completed at least 10 days prior to the date of the arbitration hearing. The
decision of the arbitrator(s) shall relate solely: (a) to whether the Indemnitee
is entitled to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the
portion of such Contested Amount the Indemnitee is entitled to recover; and (b)
to the determination of the non-prevailing party as provided below. The final
decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be furnished to the Shareholders' Agent and
the Indemnitee in writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the
issue(s) in question, binding upon the Shareholders' Agent, the Indemnitors and
the Indemnitee and shall not be contested by either of them. The non-prevailing
party in any such arbitration shall pay the reasonable expenses (including
attorneys' fees) of the prevailing party, and the fees and expenses associated
with the arbitration (including the arbitrators' fees and expenses). The non-
prevailing party shall be determined solely by the arbitrator(s). The
Indemnitors shall, within 10 days following the delivery of the final decision
of the arbitrator(s), pay the Indemnitee in accordance with the written decision
of the arbitrator(s).</P>
