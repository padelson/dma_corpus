available funds after receipt by the Paying Agent of such Certificate and
Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration paid
upon surrender of Certificates shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common Units formerly represented
by such Certificates.

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) no holder of Common Units held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_ and (B) the Paying Agent shall (and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to) promptly deliver to each holder of a Book-Entry Unit the Merger Consideration for each of such holder\'s Book-Entry Units.

 (d) _ No Further Transfers._ From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration on the books of the Company of transfers of Common Units that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_.

If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent or Parent, they shall be marked cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article III_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Common Units prior to the Effective Time that has not been registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Common Units shall be paid to the transferee of such interest if the Certificate or Book-Entry Unit that previously represented such Common Unit is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid. 

  

 (e) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Common Units for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity as general creditor thereof for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s Common Units. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of Common Units for any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to Applicable Laws regarding abandoned property. 

        

 (f) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of each of the Common Units represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_.

To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. Each Party (and their Affiliates and agents) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) reasonably in advance of the Closing Date, determine whether an amount is required to be deducted or withheld by it pursuant to this _Section 3.2(g)_, (ii) promptly notify the Company and the recipient of the payment that is believed to be subject to deduction or withholding of any such requirements, which notice shall include a reasonable description of the basis on which such amount is required to be deducted or withheld under Applicable Law, and (iii) cooperate with the Company and the recipient of such payment to reduce the amount required to be deducted or withheld to the extent permissible under Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall be entitled to require any Person to provide any certifications required to be delivered to it under Applicable Law (including, without limitation, a FIRPTA Certificate), and to withhold or cause to be withheld any Taxes required to be withheld by Parent under Applicable Law from amounts payable by Parent to any Person that fails to provide such certification, in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. 

   

 (ii) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub nor any Affiliates or agents thereof shall withhold any amounts pursuant to Section 116 of the Tax Act or any rule or regulation thereunder with respect to the ManagmentCo Interests and the Incentive Distribution Rights if Swan Sponsor has delivered to Parent on or before the Closing Date, clearance certificates issued under section 116 of the Tax Act (the " _Swan Sponsor Section 116 Certificates_") with a certificate limit not less than the portion of the Managing Member Purchase Price allocable to the ManagmentCo Interests and the Incentive Distribution Rights, respectively. If the Merger is completed as the FTM, the Company will apply for a clearance certificate under section 116 of the Tax Act in respect of any "taxable Canadian property" (as defined in the Tax Act and shall include the interests of the Company in Niska Gas Storage Operations LLC and Niska Partners Cooperatief U.A.) that, as a result of such FTM, is the subject of a disposition under the Tax Act (the " _Company Section 116 Certificates_"). Swan Sponsor and the Company, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the clearance certificates on or prior to the Closing Date. Swan Sponsor and the Company, as applicable, will prepare the filings for any applicable clearance certificate under section 116 of the Tax Act and the Parent (or its tax advisors) shall have the right to review the applications for the Company Section 116 Certificates with respect to, among other things, the allocation of consideration and/or the value of the 

  

      

  

Company\'s assets on the date of such FTM. If an amount has to be remitted to
the Canada Revenue Agency in order to obtain a Company Section 116
Certificate, Swan Sponsor and not the Company shall be responsible for
remitting and paying such amount; _provided_ , however, that to the extent
Swan Sponsor remits or pays such an amount, such amount shall not result in a
reduction of amounts payable to Swan Sponsor pursuant to this Agreement,
including under _Section 9.3(i)_ or _Section 12.1(g)_. If an application
for a clearance certificate under section 116 of the Tax Act described in
this  _Section 3.2(g)(ii)_ by Swan Sponsor or the Company remains
outstanding at the Closing Date, then Swan Sponsor, the Company and Parent
will enter into an escrow agreement, with Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP as
the escrow agent, to deal with the escrow and remittance of any applicable
withholdings to the Receiver General for Canada, on terms and conditions that
are customary for such agreements in Canada, including provisions to delay
remittance of any withheld funds if a comfort letter, in a form and substance
satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably, is obtained prior to the date upon

 (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Eligible Person (and its Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Proposal. 

    

 (iii) The Company Entities and Swan Sponsor may not take the actions described in _Section 6.13(a)(ii)_ unless, prior to taking any such action: 

    

 (A) the Company Entities have (1) received from such Eligible Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms that are no less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, excluding any standstill provisions (and compliant with the last sentence of _Section 6.13(f))_ and (2) disclosed to Parent (and, if applicable, contemporaneously provided copies of) any non-public information to be provided to such Eligible Person and any books or records to which such Eligible Person will be afforded access, in each case, to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives; 

   

      

   

 (B) the Company Board has delivered to Parent written notice prior to taking any such action (1) stating that the Company Board intends to take such action, (2) stating that the Company Board has made the determination set forth in _Section 6.13(a)(iii)(C)_) and (3) including an unredacted, executed copy of the confidentiality agreement described in _Section 6.13(a)(iii)(A)_and 

  

 (C) the Company Board has determined, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that such Alternative Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. 

   

  

 (b) _ No Withdrawal of Recommendation._ Except as set forth in _Section 6.13(c)_, no Non-Solicit Party shall: 

  

  

 (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation;

 (iv) approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

 _provided_ that the making of any determination of the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) to provide, or the provision of, a Superior
Proposal Notice in compliance with the terms of this Agreement shall not, in
and of itself, be deemed a Withdrawal of Recommendation.

   

 (c) _ Certain Permitted Withdrawals of Recommendation._ Subject to _Section 6.13(d)_, at any time prior to the end of the Unitholder Consent Period, the Company Board may effect, or cause the Company Entities to effect, as the case may be, a Withdrawal of Recommendation if: (i) the Company Board determines that after complying with _Section 6.13(d)(i)_, an Alternative Proposal proposed or offered by an Eligible Person constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company Board determines, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that the Transactions (after taking into account the provision of the Short-Term Credit Facility by an Affiliate of Parent to the Company) are not in the best interests of the Unaffiliated Unitholders. 

  

 (d) _ Procedure Prior to Withdrawal of Recommendation._ 

  

  

 (i) Superior Proposal. The Company Board shall be entitled to effect, or cause the Company Entities to effect, a Withdrawal of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent permitted under _Section 6.13(c)_), only if (A) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (1) stating that the Company Board intends to take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.13(c)_, and (2) stating that the Company Board has made the determinations set forth in _Section 6.13(c)(c)(i)_ and _6.13(c)(c)(ii)_ and (3) including an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal and proposed and unredacted form of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement related to such Superior Proposal, and (B) the Negotiation Period shall have expired. During the five (5) Business Day period commencing on the date of Parent\'s receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (such period, the " _Negotiation Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new Negotiation Period), the Company Entities and Swan Sponsor 

  

      

  

shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that the
Alternative Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice
ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Nothing set forth in this _Section
6.13(d)(i)_ shall extend or be deemed to extend the Unitholder Consent
Period.

  

 (ii) In the event the Parties enter into an amendment to this Agreement during the Negotiation Period and if reasonably requested by Parent, (A) the applicable Company Entities and Swan Sponsor will execute a written consent approving such amendment and (B) the Company and Swan Sponsor will promptly take all action necessary to seek to obtain the written consent of the holders of a Unit Majority approving such amendment substantially in the form of Exhibit D and in compliance with the Delaware LLC Act and the LLC Agreement (such consent, the " _Amendment Consent_ "). 

  

  

 (e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.13 _shall be deemed to prohibit the Company Entities and Swan Sponsor from complying with their required disclosure obligations under applicable law with regard to an Alternative Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall not effect any Withdrawal of Recommendation, except in accordance with _Section 6.13(c) _and _Section 6.13(d) _and _provided, further_ , that in no event shall any Stop-Look-and-Listen communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act be deemed to be a Withdrawal of Recommendation or to violate this _Section 6.13_. 

  

 (f) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this _Section 6.13_, the Company Entities and Swan Sponsor shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Alternative Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to any of the Company Entities (other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an Alternative Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations with respect to an Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of the Company Entities, Swan Sponsor or any of their respective representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of such discussions, proposals, offers or requests. The Company Entities and Swan Sponsor shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, enter into any contract that would prohibit them from providing the information required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.13(f)_. 

  

    
ARTICLE VII 

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS 

  

 Section 7.1 _ Further Assurances._ From time to time after the Closing Date, at the request of any Party and at the expense of such Party so requesting, each of the Parties shall execute and deliver to such requesting Party such documents and take such other action as such requesting Party may reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the Management Member Transfer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such document or action shall increase any Party\'s liabilities, nor decrease its rights, under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.2 _ Insurance and Indemnities_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall ensure that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of any of the current and former members, directors, officers, fiduciaries and employees of any of the Company Entities or Swan Sponsor or its Affiliates (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") that are included in the Charter Documents of any of the Company Entities as of the date of this Agreement shall survive Closing and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, without amendment or modification, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made during said six- (6-) year period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. 

       

                                    

    

 (b) Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided for, which includes the continuation of the current policy) each individual who served as a director or officer of any of the Company Entities at any time prior to the Closing Date other than any director that is an employee of Swan Sponsor or any of its Controlling Affiliates (the " _Covered Officers and Directors_ ") with liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date that is no less favorable in coverage and amount than any applicable insurance in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Such insurance shall, among other things, (i) not provide for any allocation of the coverage or benefits thereof to any Person other than the Covered Officers and Directors, (ii) provide coverage to the Covered Officers and Directors substantially identical to that which would be provided under a policy covering only "independent" directors of an entity and (iii) contain a no-rescission endorsement or the substantive equivalent thereof. 

   

 (c) In the event Parent or any of the Company Entities or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or converts into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or such Company Entities, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.2_. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Company Entities under this _Section 7.2_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.2_). The rights of each Indemnified Person hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the Charter Documents of any of the Company Entities, under the laws of the State of Delaware or otherwise.

 Section 8.1 _ Compensation and Benefits_. 

  

 (a) With respect to each of the Business Employees whose employment with Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) continues following the Closing Date other than the employees set forth on _Schedule 8.1(a)_ (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall or shall cause its Affiliate to, for a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, (i) provide a base salary or base hourly wage rate and annual bonus or commission opportunities that are no less favorable than those in effect for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) make available a package of employee benefits and supplemental pay that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the package of employee benefits provided by Buyer and its Affiliates to their similarly situated employees.

 (b) Effective from and after the Closing Date, the Continuing Employees shall be given credit for all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (other than with respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section (3)(35) of ERISA or retiree medical benefits) maintained from time to time by Parent or the Company Entities in which the Continuing Employees participate, for such Continuing Employees\' service with any of the Company Entities or their Affiliates including vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was taken into account under a corresponding Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date.

Swan Sponsor and Parent will cooperate and use their reasonable endeavors to provide data to each other to assist both Swan Sponsor and Parent in ascertaining their obligations under the WARN Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Parent and its Affiliates shall take no post-Closing action that will cause any pre-Closing employment loss to have been subject to notice requirements under the WARN Act.

 Section 11.2 _ Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of this _Article XI_, Swan Sponsor hereby indemnifies Parent and Merger Sub and their successors and permitted assigns against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all damage, loss and expense (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding involving a third-party claim) (" _Damages_ ") actually suffered by Parent, Merger Sub, any Company Entity or any their successors or permitted assigns to the extent arising out of: 

  

  

 (i) any breach of any Swan Sponsor Fundamental Representation; 

  

 (ii) any breach by Swan Sponsor or an of the Company Entities of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Swan Sponsor or any Company Entity pursuant to this Agreement; or 

  

 (iii) any Swan Sponsor Benefit Plan Liabilities. 

  

  

 (b) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of this _Article XI_, Parent hereby indemnifies Swan Sponsor and its successors and permitted assigns against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages actually suffered by Swan Sponsor, its successors or permitted assigns arising out of: 

  

  

 (i) any breach of a Parent Fundamental Representation; or 

  

 (ii) any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

  

 (c) Subject to _Section 11.7,_ Swan Sponsor\'s aggregate liability under this _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ shall not exceed NINETY FOUR MILLION SIXTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS ($94,061,659.00). Subject to _Section 11.7_, following the Effective Time and excluding the performance and satisfaction of any and all agreements, covenants and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_, Parent\'s aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed NINETY FOUR MILLION SIXTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS ($94,061,659.00). 

        

 (d) Solely for purposes of this _Section 11.2_, in determining whether any breach has occurred and in determining the amount of any Damages, all representations and warranties that are qualified by materiality or by reference to Material Adverse Effect or similar terms shall be deemed to be not so qualified. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Unitholders\' Representative shall not be liable to any Person as a result of any action taken (or failure to take any action) in its capacity as Unitholders\' Representative. 

  

 Section 11.3 _ Third-Party Claim Procedures_. 

   

 (a) The Party seeking indemnification under this _Article XI_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the Party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party of a Third-Party Claim that arises within the applicable limitations period set forth in _Section 11.1_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 11.3_, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its own expense. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 11.3_, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim, if the settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (d) In connection with the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, each Party shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such claim, (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished such documents, records, information and testimony, grant or cause to be granted access to all reasonably requested witnesses, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, in each case as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, and (iii) take all reasonable steps to make available to the other Party, upon written request, its former and current employees, other personnel and agents (whether as witnesses or otherwise) to the extent that such persons may reasonably be required in connection therewith. Neither Swan Sponsor nor Parent shall (and each of Swan Sponsor and Parent shall cause its respective Affiliates not to) destroy or dispose of any documents, records or information related to the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim without first using its reasonable best efforts to notify the other Party of the proposed destruction or disposition and giving the other Party the opportunity to take possession of or copy such documents, records or information prior to such destruction or disposition. 

  

 Section 11.4 _ Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under this _Article XI_ against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for indemnification 

        

(taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified
Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such
failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

  

 Section 11.5 _ Calculation of Damages_. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Agreement for any (i) consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or punitive Damages, (ii) Damages for lost profits or opportunities or diminution in value or Damages based on a multiple, or (iii) Damages arising out of changes after the Closing Date in Applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any loss or Damages for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage; _provided that_ the foregoing shall have no effect on the Indemnifying Party\'s obligations under this _Section 11.5_. To the extent that an Indemnified Party receives any amounts pursuant to any such insurance claim, such Indemnified Party shall pay such amount to the Indemnifying Party; _provided that_ (i) the Indemnifying Party has discharged its obligations to the Indemnified Party in full with regard to the Damages relating to any such insurance claim and (ii) in no event shall the Indemnified Party be obligated to pay over to the Indemnifying Party any amount in excess of the amount received from the Indemnifying Party in relation to such Damages. 

  

 Section 11.6 _ Assignment of Claims._ If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to _Section 11.2_ and the Indemnified Party potentially could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ "), to the extent permitted by applicable law or contract, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. 

  

 Section 11.7 _ Sole and Exclusive Remedy._ After the Closing, except as expressly set forth in this _Article XI_ or _Article XII_, each Party hereto (on behalf of itself and its successors, permitted assigns and Affiliates) waives, releases and forever discharges any rights, suits, liabilities (including strict liabilities and liabilities under any Applicable Law, including Environmental Laws), demands, actions, claims, (including any claims for equitable or injunctive relief), proceedings, obligations, debts, Damages, losses, costs, expenses, notices of violation, administrative orders, lost profits, diminutions in value, fines, penalties, charges, fees, expenses, judgments, awards, amounts paid in settlement, costs or expenses of any kind or nature (including attorneys\' fees, consulting fees and expenses, out-of-pocket costs including court costs and other costs of defense including the costs of investigating any and all threatened claims, suits, actions or proceedings), whether known or unknown, and whether past, present or future (collectively, " _Claims_ "), it or its successors, permitted assigns or Affiliates may have now or in the future against each other Party or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors or employees, whether in law or in equity, relating to or arising out of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Claims waived, released, and forever discharged by the Parties include any and all claims under any Applicable Law, including Environmental Laws, (whether now or hereinafter in effect) including claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to the foregoing, including Remediation, non-compliance with Applicable Laws, including Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ will provide the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Claims (other than claims arising out of fraud or other criminal acts on the part of any Party, it being understood that fraud shall not include claims arising out of negligent misrepresentation) in connection with this Agreement. 

        

 Section 11.8 _ Purchase Price Adjustment._ Each Party shall treat all payments made pursuant to this _Article XI_ or _Article XII_ as adjustments to the Managing Member Purchase Price (and, if appropriate, the Merger Consideration paid to Swan Sponsor) for all Tax purposes. 

  

 Section 11.9 _ No Recourse._ For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as Parties (or their successors or permitted assigns) and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party (or its successors or permitted assigns). Except to the extent a Party is a named Party (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this Agreement), (a) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, financing source, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named Party to this Agreement and (b) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, financing source, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any of the Parties under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any Claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 11.9_ shall limit the obligations or liabilities of any of the Guarantors under the Guaranty or any of the Swan Sponsor Guarantors under the Swan Sponsor Guaranty. 

  

    
ARTICLE XII 

TAX MATTERS 

  

 Section 12.1 _ Tax Indemnity._ 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Swan Sponsor shall indemnify and hold Parent Entities and their Affiliates harmless from (i) all liability for and any Claims relating to Taxes of Swan Sponsor for any period and (ii) all liability for and any Claims relating to Taxes of any Person other than a Company Entity for which a Company Entity may be liable by contract, operation of law, or otherwise with regard to, attributable to, or arising with respect to any Pre-Closing Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and (iii) all liability for and any Claims relating to Taxes payable by Parent, Merger Sub or a Company Entity under section 116 of the Tax Act as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) With respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be calculated as though the Straddle Period terminated as of the close of business on the Closing Date (provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning immediately after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a Tax not based on income, receipts, proceeds, profits or similar items, such Taxes shall be equal to the amount of Tax for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the beginning of the Straddle Period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the Straddle Period. 

   

 (c) Parent shall indemnify and hold Swan Sponsor harmless from and against any and all Taxes of, or pertaining or attributable to, the Company Entities with respect to any taxable period or portion of a Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date. 

        

 (d) The indemnities provided in this _Article XII_ shall survive the Closing until the date that is seven (7) years from the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) Swan Sponsor\'s liability pursuant to this _Article XII_ shall be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 11.2(c)_. 

  

 (f) The amount of any refunds actually received (plus any interest received from a taxing authority attributable to such refund) by a Company Entity after the Closing of any Taxes described in _Section 12.1_ above or Taxes which are paid directly by Swan Sponsor (and which do not constitute part of the Merger Consideration and which are not put into escrow under _Section 9.3(i)_) to obtain a Company Section 116 Certificate, to the extent such amounts were actually indemnified and paid or otherwise borne by Swan Sponsor or its Affiliates pursuant to _this Agreement_ , shall be for the account of Swan Sponsor. The amount of any such refund with respect to any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 12.1(b)_. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account that reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent, the Company Entities and their Affiliates will be netted from the refunded amount or otherwise reimbursed by Swan Sponsor) to cooperate with each other, at the sole cost and expense of Swan Sponsor, such costs and expenses to be reimbursed on demand, to the extent permissible under Applicable Law, in obtaining and maximizing the amount of any such refunds, and Parent shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) to forward, to Swan Sponsor any such refund within thirty (30) days after such refund is actually received, net of any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by Parent, a Company Entity or its Affiliates in procuring such refund, including any Taxes actually paid by a Company Entity on such refund of Taxes net of any Tax benefits actually realized by a Company Entity (for the avoidance of doubt, in each case, not including the owners of the Company) as a result of the accrual or payment of such refunded Taxes (with the Taxes and Tax benefits being computed based on the applicable federal, state and provincial corporate income tax rates in effect for the year in which the refund is received or the accrual or payment of the refunded Taxes occurred, as applicable), it being understood that Parent, the Company Entities and their Affiliates shall have no obligation to take any action under this _Section 12.1(f)_ that results in any unreimbursed adverse economic consequences to any of the them. For greater certainty, any refund that a Company Entity is legally entitled to but is received by a Parent Entity (or Affiliates of the Parent Entity or the Company Entities) shall be deemed, for the purposes of this _Section 12.1(f)_, to be received by the Company Entity. 

  

 (g) In the event the Merger is completed as the FTM and amounts are required to be placed into escrow from the consideration otherwise payable to Swan Sponsor pursuant to _Section 9.3(i)_, Swan Sponsor shall be responsible for 100% of any amounts required to be withheld pursuant to Section 116 of the Tax Act as a result of the transfers made by Company pursuant to the FTM. If a Company Section 116 Certificate is received after the Closing Date, 100% of any amounts held in escrow with respect to such Company Section 116 Certificate (other than amounts required to be remitted to the Receiver General for Canada in accordance with the Tax Act) shall be released to Swan Sponsor. In the event that any amounts are remitted to the Receiver General for Canada due to the failure to obtain any Company Section 116 Certificate (or the failure to obtain a clearance certificate with a sufficient certificate limit), then (i) in accordance with this section, Swan Sponsor shall economically bear, and be responsible for, the amounts required to be remitted, and the amounts so remitted shall be a reduction of in the consideration otherwise payable to Swan Sponsor under this Agreement; (ii) Swan Sponsor shall be entitled to prepare any applicable filings with the Canada Revenue Agency to apply for a refund of any such withholdings, and (iii) in accordance with _Section 12.1(f)_, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account that reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent, the Company Entities and their Affiliates will be netted from the refunded amount or otherwise reimbursed by Swan Sponsor) to cooperate with Swan Sponsor, at the sole cost and expense of Swan Sponsor, such costs and expenses to be reimbursed on 

        

demand in making such filings and, to the extent permissible under Applicable
Law, obtaining and maximizing such refund, it being understood that Parent,
the Company Entities and their Affiliates shall have no obligation to take
any action under this _Section 12.1(g)_ that results in any unreimbursed
adverse economic consequences to any of them.

  

 Section 12.2 _ Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns._ 

  

 (a) The Unitholders\' Representative and its agents shall be entitled to prepare the IRS Form 1065 (and any similar or analogous U.S. state or local partnership income Tax Return) of the Company for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that is due after the Closing Date. If the Unitholders\' Representative elects to prepare such a Tax Return, then it shall prepare such Tax Return consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax Return, deliver a draft of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and work papers, to the Parent for its reasonable review and comment, and Unitholders\' Representative shall incorporate any reasonable comments received from Parent. With respect to all other Tax Returns of the Company Entities due after the Closing Date relating to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period (for the avoidance of doubt, including those Tax Returns that Unitholders\' Representative does not elect to prepare pursuant to the preceding two sentences), Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to prepare consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and deliver a copy of any such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and work papers, to the Unitholders\' Representative and its agents for their reasonable review and comment promptly (in the case of an income Tax Return, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax Return), and Parent shall incorporate any reasonable comments received from Unitholders\' Representative. Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to (a) cause any Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this _Section 12.2(a)_ to be timely filed as prepared, (b) provide a copy of such filed Tax Return to the Unitholders\' Representative and its agents, and (c) promptly provide each Unitholder with any information required to be provided under Applicable Law in a manner and timing consistent with past practice (including, but not limited to, an IRS Form K-1 and any similar form under U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Applicable Law). Swan Sponsor shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the portion of any Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns that are its responsibility pursuant to _Section 12.1_ no later than the due date of the Tax Return. 

  

 (b) The Parties and their respective Affiliates shall make reasonable efforts to cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties (including the Unitholders\' Representative) in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Tax proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of records, work papers and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax proceeding and explanation of any material provided hereunder. 

  

 (c) Unless required by applicable Law or except as set forth below, (i) no amended Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period shall be filed by or on behalf of a Company Entity without consent of Swan Sponsor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if such amended Tax Return or settlement would increase the liability of Swan Sponsor with respect to Taxes, and (ii) no amended IRS Form 1065 (or any similar or analogous U.S. state or local partnership income Tax Return) of the Company for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be filed by or on behalf of a Company Entity without consent of Swan Sponsor. Notwithstanding the above, Parent may file or cause to be filed an amended Tax Return (other than a Return described in Section 12.2(c)(ii) above) even if not required by applicable Law without the consent of Swan Sponsor, provided that any additional Taxes resulting therefrom will not be deemed to constitute Taxes that give rise to a liability of Swan Sponsor. 

        

 Section 12.3 _ Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims._ If a claim shall be made by any Taxing authority for which Swan Sponsor is or may be liable pursuant to this Agreement, the Parties shall follow the procedures set forth in _Section 11.3_. 

  

 Section 12.4 _ Intended Tax Treatment._ For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax that follow the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the Parties intend to treat the Merger and the Managing Member Transfer as though: (a) if the Merger is completed as the FTM, (i) first, Swan Sponsor (or, if Swan Sponsor is disregarded as an entity separate from another Person, such other Person) sold the Managing Member Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights to Parent in exchange for the Managing Member Purchase Price and any other amounts properly treated as consideration therefor for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) second and immediately thereafter, the Company transferred assets to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any other amounts properly treated as consideration therefor for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (iii) third and immediately thereafter, the Company distributed the Merger Consideration to the Members in complete liquidation of Company; or (b) if the Merger is completed as the RTM, (i) with respect to the Members, (A) Swan Sponsor (or, if Swan Sponsor is disregarded as an entity separate from another Person, such other Person) sold the Managing Member Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights to Parent in exchange for the Managing Member Purchase Price and any other amounts properly treated as consideration therefor for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (B) the Members sold their respective Common Units to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any other amounts properly treated as consideration therefor for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) with respect to Parent, the Company distributed all of its assets to the Members and Parent purchased the assets of the Company from the Members in exchange for the Managing Member Purchase Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts properly treated as consideration therefor for U.S. federal income tax purposes (together, and as applicable, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). The Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, (i) report consistently with the Intended Tax Treatment in all Tax Returns unless required to do so by a final determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) or a relevant change, enactment or publication of Applicable Law, and (ii) promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any (A) Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to the Intended Tax Treatment or (B) change, enactment or publication of Applicable Law that such Party believes is relevant to the Intended Tax Treatment and would require such Party to take a position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment. No Party shall take any position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment unless required to do so by a final determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code) or a relevant change, enactment or publication of Applicable Law. 

   

 Section 12.5 _ Purchase Price Allocation._ The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree at or prior to Closing on an allocation of the Merger Consideration, the Managing Member Purchase Price and any other amounts properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent known at such time) among the assets of Company that complies with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (if agreed and as subsequently adjusted, the " _Agreed Allocation_ "). The Parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Agreed Allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the Merger Consideration or Managing Member Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) report consistently with the Agreed Allocation in all Tax Returns unless required to do so by a final determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code), and (iii) promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to the Agreed Allocation. No Party shall take any position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Agreed Allocation unless required to do so by a final determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code). 

       

                                    

    

 Section 12.6 _ Transfer Taxes._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, although the Parties do not necessarily anticipate that any such Taxes will be imposed, Parent and Merger Sub shall be solely responsible for the payment of, and shall reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold harmless all other Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to, any and all transfer, sales, use, excise, real property transfer, gross receipts, goods and services, purchase, documentary, stamp, registration, retailer occupation or other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. For greater certainty, Transfer Taxes shall not include income or withholding Taxes, including Taxes imposed under section 116 of the Tax Act or under Section 1445 of the Code in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 Section 13.8 _ No Waiver._ The failure of any Party to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to take advantage of any of its rights under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents shall not operate as a continuing waiver of such rights. 

  

 Section 13.9 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in counterparts (including by portable document format (PDF) or other electronic means), each of which will be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 Section 13.10 _ Exhibits and Schedules._ The Schedules shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) any item disclosed in any particular part of the Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other part of the Schedules to the extent its relevance or appropriateness is reasonably apparent; (b) no disclosure of any matter contained in the Schedules shall create an implication that such matter meets any standard of materiality; (c) matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Schedules (such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature), nor shall the inclusion of any item be construed as implying that any such item is material for any purpose; (d) disclosures contained in the Schedules that refer to a document are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of such document and any annexes, exhibits or schedules thereto; and (e) headings and introductory language have been inserted on the sections of the Schedules for convenience of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the express description of the sections as set forth in this Agreement. All capitalized terms not defined in the Schedules shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 13.11 _ Counsel._ Parent hereby waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause ManagementCo and the Company to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with (a) the undertaking after the Closing by any legal counsel representing ManagementCo and the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to represent any current equity holder, officer, employee or director of ManagementCo or the Company (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in a matter involving this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) the communication by such counsel to any such Designated Person, in any such representation, of any fact known to such counsel, including in connection with a dispute with Parent or following the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such waiver shall not be deemed to be or used as a basis for contending that ManagementCo or the Company has waived its attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any information which any such Designated Person or legal counsel learned prior to the Closing shall not be prohibited by virtue of this _Section 13.11_ from being used in connection with any such representation by such legal counsel of such Designated Person after the Closing). 

  

 Section 13.12 _ Time of the Essence._ Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement in all respects. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day. 

        

 Section 13.13 _ No Presumption against Drafting Party._ Each Party has fully participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity, question of intent or question of interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if drafted jointly, and there must not be any presumption, inference or conclusion drawn against any Party by virtue of the fact that its representative has authored this Agreement or any portion hereof. 

  

 Section 13.14 _ Specific Performance._ Irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including each Party\'s obligations under _Article II_ or _Section 6.3_) were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. In the event of any breach or threatened breach by any Party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (on behalf of itself and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement) (a) an Order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, agreement or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. No Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 13.14_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. 

   

 Section 13.15 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts of law rule or principle that might refer such construction to the laws of another jurisdiction. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if jurisdiction is not available in the Delaware Court of Chancery, to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware) with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in relation to this Agreement (including any claims made in contract, tort or otherwise related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), and each of the Parties agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect to any such dispute, claim or controversy shall be instituted exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if jurisdiction is not available in the Delaware Court of Chancery, then exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware). 

  

 Section 13.16 _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO, IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PROTECTION, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
