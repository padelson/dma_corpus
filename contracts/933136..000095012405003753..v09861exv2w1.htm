WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC., a Washington corporation (&#147;<U>Washington Mutual</U>&#148;), and PROVIDIAN
FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Providian</U>&#148;).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective Boards of Directors of each of Washington Mutual and Providian have determined

amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;) and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization

laws of the State of Delaware. Providian has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not have nor reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on Providian. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;<U>Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means,
with respect to Providian, Washington Mutual or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, (i)
a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii)&nbsp;a material adverse effect on such party&#146;s
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be
excluded any effect on the referenced party the cause of which is (A)&nbsp;any change in banking,
savings association and similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (B)&nbsp;any change in generally accepted
accounting principles (&#147;<U>GAAP</U>&#148;) or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks,
savings associations, or their holding companies generally, (C)&nbsp;the announcement of this Agreement
or any action of either party or any Subsidiary thereof required to be taken by it under this

companies, savings associations, or their holding companies generally (including changes in the
prevailing interest rates), <U>provided</U> that the effect of such changes described in this
clause (D) (including changes in the interest rates) shall not be excluded to the extent of the
materially disproportionate impact (if any) they have on such party as measured relative to
similarly situated companies in that party&#146;s segment of the financial services industry.

respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such financial

that material information relating to Providian, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Providian by others within

Disclosure Schedule (as defined below), Washington Mutual hereby represents and warrants to
Providian as follows:

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Washington. Washington Mutual
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual. Washington Mutual is duly registered as a savings
and loan holding company under the Home Owners&#146; Loan Act, as amended (&#147;<U>HOLA</U>&#148;). The copies
of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Washington Mutual which have previously been made
available to Providian are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement. WMB is duly organized and in good standing as a federal savings
association under HOLA and its deposits are insured by the FDIC primarily through the Savings
Association Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law. WMB is a member in good
standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. The minute books of Washington Mutual and
each of its Subsidiaries previously made available to Providian contain true, complete and correct
records in all material respects of all meetings and other material corporate actions held or taken
since December&nbsp;31, 2004 of their respective stockholders and Boards of Directors (including
committees of their respective Boards of Directors) through the date hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2 <U>Capitalization</U>. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Washington
Mutual consists of 1,600,000,000 shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, no par value. As of the close of business on June&nbsp;2, 2005, there were 877,959,428
shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock of Washington
Mutual outstanding. As of the close of business on June&nbsp;2, 2005, no shares of Washington Mutual
Common Stock were reserved for issuance and 700,000 shares of preferred stock of Washington Mutual
were reserved for issuance in accordance with the Washington Mutual Rights Agreement. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, except (i)&nbsp;as set

Each of the Washington Mutual SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied

amendment, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to

therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received

Washington Mutual, none of the Washington Mutual SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review
or outstanding SEC comment.

material in nature or amount) the results of the consolidated operations and changes in
stockholders&#146; equity and consolidated financial position of Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries

the SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the related notes,
where applicable) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto or, in the

means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls described below in this Section&nbsp;5.6(c). Washington Mutual (i)&nbsp;has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Washington Mutual, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial
officer of Washington Mutual by others within those entities, and (ii)&nbsp;has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Washington Mutual&#146;s outside auditors and the
audit committee of Washington Mutual&#146;s Board of Directors (x)&nbsp;any significant deficiencies and

determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and
equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

the NYSE. Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, Washington Mutual and Providian

available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably
requested by the other party. In addition, Providian and its Subsidiaries shall (a)&nbsp;consult with
Washington Mutual regarding communications with customers, stockholders, prospective investors and
employees related to the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)&nbsp;provide Washington Mutual with
stockholder lists of Providian and (c)&nbsp;allow and facilitate Washington Mutual contact with
stockholders of Providian and other prospective investors.

hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section&nbsp;7.8 hereof, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
