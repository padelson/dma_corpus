AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 5, 2005 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " _Agreement_ "), is entered into by and between WASHINGTON MUTUAL, INC., a Washington corporation (" _Washington Mutual_ "), and PROVIDIAN FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Providian_ ").    

 The respective Boards of Directors of each of Washington Mutual and Providian have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the business combination transactions provided for herein pursuant to which Providian will merge with and into Washington Mutual (the " _Merger_ ") and immediately thereafter Providian National Bank (" _PNB_ ") will merge (the " _Subsidiary Merger_ ") with and into Washington Mutual Bank, FA (" _WMB_ ").    

 It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the Merger be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).    

 Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:    

     1.   | THE MERGER  
---|--- 
     

 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) Providian shall merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Washington Mutual. Washington Mutual shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the " _Surviving Company_ ") in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Washington. The name of the Surviving Company shall be Washington Mutual. Upon consummation of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Providian shall terminate.    

 1.2 _Effective Time_.

     2.   | EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS  
---|--- 
     

 2.1 _Conversion of Providian Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Washington Mutual, Providian or the holder of any of the shares of common stock of Providian, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:    

 (a) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Providian (the " _Providian Common Stock_ ") owned directly by Providian (including treasury shares) or Washington Mutual (other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall not represent capital stock of the Surviving Company and shall not be exchanged for shares of common stock, no par value, of Washington Mutual (" _Washington Mutual Common Stock_ "), cash or other consideration.    

 (b) Each outstanding share of Providian Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) together with the associated rights (the " _Providian Rights_ ") issued pursuant to the Providian Rights Plan (as hereinafter defined) shall, subject to Section 2.2, be converted into and become the right to receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") equal to the Per Share Amount and (ii) the number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Stock Ratio, together with the requisite number of rights (the " _Washington Mutual Rights_ ") issued pursuant to the Washington Mutual Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (the " _Stock_       ##### 

  

     

 _Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration and the
consideration provided for in Section 2.2, the " _Merger Consideration_
").    

 " _Cash Ratio_ " shall mean 0.11.    

 " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean 0.45.    

 " _Per Share Amount_ " shall mean the product obtained by multiplying (x) the product of the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Ratio by (y) the Washington Mutual Share Price.    

 " _Stock Ratio_ " shall mean 0.89.    

 " _Washington Mutual Share Price_ " shall mean the average of the closing sale prices of one share of Washington Mutual Common Stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_.    

 (c) The Exchange Ratio set forth above shall be subject to appropriate and proportionate adjustments in the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Washington Mutual Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities through reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other like changes in Washington Mutuals capitalization.    

 (d) Each outstanding share of Providian Common Stock held by a holder who has perfected such holders right to dissent under the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted pursuant to the DGCL. Providian shall give Washington Mutual prompt notice upon receipt by Providian of any such demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of Providian Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter referred to as a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "), and Washington Mutual shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Providian shall not, except with the prior written consent of Washington Mutual, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL.    

 (e) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders shares of Providian Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in this Section 2.1, without any interest thereon.    

 2.2 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common      ##### 

  

     

Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have
been entitled to a fraction of a share of Washington Mutual Common Stock
shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined
by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Providian
Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the Washington
Mutual Share Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.    

 2.3 _Washington Mutual Common Stock; Washington Mutual Preferred Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Washington Mutual Common Stock and each share of preferred stock of Washington Mutual, if any, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock or preferred stock, as the case may be, of Washington Mutual and shall not be affected by the Merger.    

 2.4 _Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards._     

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Providian to purchase shares of Providian Common Stock (each a " _Providian Option_ ") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Providian Common Stock and shall vest and be converted automatically into an option to purchase a number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") at an exercise price determined as provided below (and the Converted Option otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the Providian 1997 Stock Option Plan, the Providian Stock Ownership Plan, the Providian Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, and the Providian 1999 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan, as applicable, (collectively, and in each case as the same may be amended to the date hereof, the " _Providian Stock Plans_ "), and the agreements or letters evidencing grants thereunder):     

 (i) the number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to be subject to the Converted Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Providian Common Stock subject to the Providian Option and (y) the Exchange Ratio, _provided_  that any fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share; and    

 (ii) the exercise price per share of Washington Mutual Common Stock under the Converted Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Providian Common Stock under the Providian Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.   

 In the case of any Providian Options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), the exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such options and the terms and conditions of exercise of such options shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code and to avoid a "modification" of any such option under Code Section 424(h). In all events, Providian Options shall be converted into Converted Options in such a manner as to be compliant with Section 409A of the Code and any guidance issued thereupon by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.4, the duration and other terms of each Converted Option shall be the     ##### 

  

     

same as the applicable Providian Option except that all references to
Providian shall be deemed to be references to Washington Mutual.    

 (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Providian Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Providian Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Providian Common Stock, granted under the Providian Stock Plans (including restricted stock units, deferred stock units, phantom stock units and dividend equivalents), other than restricted stock (which shall vest and be treated the same as outstanding shares of Providian Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1) and Providian Options (each, a " _Providian Stock-Based Award_ "), which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Providian Common Stock and shall vest and be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect to a number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock (a " _Converted Award_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Providian Common Stock subject to the Providian Stock-Based Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share (and the Converted Awards otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the _Plans_ and the agreements or letters evidencing grants thereunder).    

 (c) The foregoing provisions of Section 2.4(a) and (b) shall not apply to the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement intending to qualify as a stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code (the " _Providian ESPP_ "). The Providian ESPP and all outstanding rights thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time and the offering periods thereunder shall be deemed to end on the NYSE trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the rights of each participating Providian employee then outstanding shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on such NYSE trading day. On such trading day, each participating Providian employee will be credited with the number of shares of Providian Common Stock purchased for his or her account(s) under the Providian ESPP during such offering period. The Board of Directors of Providian shall send written notice of the Merger that will result in the termination of the Providian ESPP to all participating Providian employees not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.    

 (d) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, Providian shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Providian Option nor any holder of any Providian Stock-Based Award shall have any right to acquire equity securities of Providian or the Surviving Corporation (except to the extent required under any qualified plan maintained by Providian or any of its Subsidiaries). Promptly, but in any event within two Business Days, following the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock subject to such Converted Options and Converted Awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Converted Options and Converted Awards remain outstanding.     ##### 

  

     

 2.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.    

 2.6 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Washington Mutual may at any time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable, including to provide for a merger of Providian with a wholly owned subsidiary of Washington Mutual; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (b) adversely affect the anticipated tax consequences of the Merger to the holders of Providian Common Stock as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or (c) materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger. In the event Washington Mutual elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the change.    

     3.   | EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION  
---|--- 
     

 3.1 _Washington Mutual to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or promptly after the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Washington Mutual and reasonably acceptable to Providian (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Providian Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Section 3, certificates representing the Stock Consideration and an amount of cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 (such cash and certificates for shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Washington Mutual. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to the Surviving Company.    

 3.2 _Exchange of Shares_.    

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of Providian Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 hereof, and (ii) a check representing the amount of cash (including the Cash Consideration and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock), which such former holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 hereof, in each case, in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions     ##### 

  

     

of this Section 3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or
the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.    

 (b) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Washington Mutual Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3\. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 3, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock represented by such Certificate.    

 (c) If payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the payment or issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to any person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.    

 (d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Providian of the shares of Providian Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 3.    

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Providian for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of Washington Mutual, to Washington Mutual. Any stockholders of Providian who have not theretofore complied with this Section 3 shall thereafter look only to Washington Mutual for payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Washington Mutual Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Providian Common Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Washington Mutual, Providian, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Providian Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.    

 (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Washington Mutual, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Washington Mutual may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.     ##### 

  

     

 (g) Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Providian Common Stock such amounts as Washington Mutual (or any affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Providian Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Washington Mutual or the Exchange Agent.    

4\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PROVIDIAN.    

 Except as otherwise specified in a correspondingly enumerated section of the Providian Disclosure Schedule (as defined below), Providian hereby represents and warrants to Washington Mutual as follows:    

 4.1 _Corporate Organization_.    

 (a) Providian is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Providian has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have nor reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Providian. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Providian, Washington Mutual or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, (i) a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) a material adverse effect on such partys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect on the referenced party the cause of which is (A) any change in banking, savings association and similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (B) any change in generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks, savings associations, or their holding companies generally, (C) the announcement of this Agreement or any action of either party or any Subsidiary thereof required to be taken by it under this Agreement and (D) any changes in general economic conditions affecting banks, credit card companies, savings associations, or their holding companies generally (including changes in the prevailing interest rates), _provided_ that the effect of such changes described in this clause (D) (including changes in the interest rates) shall not be excluded to the extent of the materially disproportionate impact (if any) they have on such party as measured relative to similarly situated companies in that partys segment of the financial services industry.     ##### 

  

     

 (b) Providian is not required to be registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "), by virtue of the exemption set forth in §4(f) thereof. The copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Providian which have previously been made available to Washington Mutual are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.    

 (c) Each Subsidiary of Providian (i) is duly organized and validly existing as a national banking association, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, as the case may be, under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would have or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Providian and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or any other entity that is consolidated with such person for financial reporting purposes.    

 (d) The deposit accounts of PNB are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Bank Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due.    

 (e) The minute books of Providian and each of its Subsidiaries previously made available to Washington Mutual contain true, complete and correct records in all material respects of all meetings and other material corporate actions held or taken since December 31, 2002 of their respective stockholders and Boards of Directors (including committees of their respective Boards of Directors) through the date hereof.    

 4.2 _Capitalization_.    

 (a) The authorized capital stock of Providian consists of 800,000,000 shares of Providian Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Providian (the " _Providian Preferred Stock_ ").

Common Stock were reserved or to be made available for issuance upon

"), (vii) 14,000,000 shares of Providian Common Stock were reserved or to be
made available for issuance under the Providian Dividend Reinvestment and
Direct Stock Purchase Plan and (viii) 1,000,000 shares of Providian Preferred
Stock were designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, and were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
rights granted under Providians Rights Agreement, dated as of June 1, 1997
and amended as of February 17, 1999 (the " _Providian Rights Plan_ "). All of
the issued and outstanding shares of Providian Common Stock have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, except (i) as set forth
in Section 4.2(a) of the disclosure schedule of Providian delivered to
Washington Mutual concurrently herewith (the " _Providian Disclosure
Schedule_ "), (ii) pursuant to any cashless exercise provisions of any
Providian Options or pursuant to the surrender of shares to Providian or the
withholding of shares by Providian to cover tax withholding obligations
under Providian Stock Plans, and (iii) as set forth elsewhere in this Section
4.2(a), Providian does not have and is not bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of Providian
Common Stock or Providian Preferred Stock or any other equity securities of
Providian or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of Providian capital stock (including any rights plan or
agreement). Section 4.2(a) of the Providian Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, complete and correct list of the aggregate number of shares of Providian
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each stock option granted under
the Providian Stock Plans that was outstanding as of the Capitalization Date
and the exercise price for each such Providian stock option. Since the
Capitalization Date, Providian has not (i) issued or repurchased any shares
of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable for
any shares of its capital stock, other than upon the exercise of employee
stock options granted prior to such date and disclosed in this Section 4.2(a)
or pursuant to the surrender of shares to Providian or the withholding of
shares by Providian to cover tax withholding obligations under the Providian
Stock Plans, or (ii) issued or awarded any options, restricted shares or
other equity-based awards under the Providian Stock Plans.    

 (b) Section 4.2(b) of the Providian Disclosure Schedule lists the name, jurisdiction of incorporation, authorized and outstanding shares of capital stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock for each entity in which Providian beneficially owns or controls, directly or indirectly, any equity interest, regardless of whether such entity is a Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Providian Disclosure Schedule, neither Providian nor any Providian Subsidiary beneficially owns or controls, directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any entity, or engages in any activity, which would not be a permissible investment or activity for a bank holding company under the BHC Act. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Providian Disclosure Schedule, Providian owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity interests in each of Providians Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares are duly authorized and     ##### 

  

     

validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.
Neither Providian nor any Subsidiary thereof has or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase, sale or issuance of any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any Subsidiary of
Providian or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any such
Subsidiary.    

 (c) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders may vote are outstanding.    

 4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.    

 (a) Providian has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate, and cause PNB to consummate, the transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of Providian at a duly held meeting has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the Subsidiary Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Providian and its stockholders and declared this Agreement and the Merger to be advisable, (ii) approved the Merger, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) recommended that stockholders of Providian adopt this Agreement and directed that such matter be submitted for consideration by Providians stockholders at the Providian Stockholders Meeting (as hereinafter defined). Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Providian Common Stock, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Providian are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Providian and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Washington Mutual) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Providian, enforceable against Providian in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally.    

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Providian nor the consummation by Providian of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Subsidiary Merger), nor compliance by Providian with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Providian or any of the similar governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained or made, (x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to Providian or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, or require redemption or repurchase or otherwise require the purchase or sale of any securities, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Providian or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or     ##### 

  

     

other instrument or obligation to which Providian or any of its Subsidiaries

 4.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.    

 (a) Providian has filed all forms, reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (all such forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since January 1, 2000, collectively, the " _Providian SEC Reports_ "). None of Providians subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). Each of the Providian SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Providian SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Providian has made available to Washington Mutual true, correct and complete copies of all written correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Providian and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since January 1, 2000, and prior to the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to the Providian SEC Reports. To the knowledge of Providian, none of the Providian SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment.    

 (b) Each of the financial statements included (or incorporated by reference) in the Providian SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable), after giving effect to any restatements made by Providian prior to the date of this Agreement, fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring adjustments, none of which are expected to be material in nature or amount) the results of the consolidated operations and changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Providian and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable), after giving effect to any restatements made by Providian prior to the date of this Agreement, complies in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q. The books and records of Providian and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.    

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Providian and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Providian or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-      ##### 

  

     

direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below
in this Section 4.6(c). Providian (i) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Providian,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Providian by others within those
entities and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Providians outside auditors and the audit committee of
Providians Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Providians ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Providians internal controls over financial reporting.
These disclosures were made in writing by management to Providians auditors
and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available
to Washington Mutual. As of the date hereof, Providian has no reason to
believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give, without qualification, the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
when next due.    

 (d) Since January 1, 2000, (i) neither Providian nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the officers of Providian, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Providian or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Providian or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Providian or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Providian or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Providian or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Providian or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Providian or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Providian.

There is no unresolved violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Governmental Entity with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries.   

 5.6 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.   

 (a) Washington Mutual has filed all forms, reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (all such forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since January 1, 2000, collectively, the " _Washington Mutual SEC Reports_ "). Each of the Washington Mutual SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of    ##### 

  

 

the Washington Mutual SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
staff with respect to the Washington Mutual SEC Reports. To the knowledge
of Washington Mutual, none of the Washington Mutual SEC Reports is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment.    

 (b) Each of the financial statements included (or incorporated by reference) in the Washington Mutual SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring adjustments, none of which are expected to be material in nature or amount) the results of the consolidated operations and changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable) complies in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q. The books and records of Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions.   

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Washington Mutual and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Washington Mutual or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 5.6(c). Washington Mutual (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Washington Mutual, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Washington Mutual by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Washington Mutuals outside auditors and the audit committee of Washington Mutuals Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Washington Mutuals ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Washington Mutuals internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Washington Mutuals auditors and audit committee. As of the date hereof, Washington Mutual has no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give, without qualification, the    ##### 

  

 

certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when

 (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction of any Governmental Entity specifically imposed upon Washington Mutual, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Washington Mutual or any of its Subsidiaries which has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Mutual.

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Providian shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of Washington Mutual access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of Providian and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, Providian shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Washington Mutual (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received    #####

Mutual may reasonably request. At the request of Washington Mutual, Providian
shall comply with its obligations under the preceding sentence by
providing electronic access to such documents and information on the online
data room established by Providian prior to the date hereof. Neither
Providian nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence

The Board of Directors of Providian shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Providian and shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Washington Mutual such recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement in connection with the Providian Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a " _Change in Providian Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7.3(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Providian Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Providian at the Providian Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Providian of such obligation. In addition to the foregoing, Providian shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Providian or otherwise involving 15% or more of the fair market value of the business of Providian and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner (including by tender or exchange offer, open market purchase, issuance by Providian or otherwise) more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, Providian and its Subsidiaries, taken as a    ##### 

  

 

whole, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and other

of business consistent with past practice.    

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Providian and its Board of Directors shall be permitted to effect a Change in Providian Recommendation if and only to the extent that:    

 (i) Providian shall have complied in all material respects with Section 7.10; and    

 (ii) (A) Providian shall have received an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and the Board of Directors of Providian shall have concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Washington Mutual pursuant to clause (D) below, (B) Providians Board of Directors, based on the advice of its outside counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (C) Providian shall notify Washington Mutual, at least five Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Providian Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnishing to Washington Mutual a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, and (D) prior to effecting such a Change in Providian Recommendation, Providian shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period following Providians delivery of the notice referred to in clause (C) above, negotiate with Washington Mutual in good faith (to the extent Washington Mutual desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Providian concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (1) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be nationally recognized investment banking firms), (2) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and (3) after taking into account all appropriate legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority" and the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a transaction involving Providian and not its Subsidiaries.   

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Providian or its board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.    ##### 

  

  

 7.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger._    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Washington Mutual and Providian shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Subsidiary Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 8 hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be obtained by Providian or Washington Mutual or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Subsidiary Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be required to take any action pursuant to the foregoing sentence if the taking of such action or the obtaining of such consents, authorizations, orders, approvals or exemptions is reasonably likely to result in a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Washington Mutual and Providian agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, using reasonable best efforts to (i) modify or amend any contracts, plans or arrangements to which Washington Mutual or Providian is a party (to the extent permitted by the terms thereof) if necessary in order to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in Section 8 hereof, (ii) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material damages.   

 7.5 _Affiliates_. Providian shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Providian to deliver to Washington Mutual, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the date of the Providian Stockholders Meeting, a written agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Washington Mutual, relating to required transfer restrictions on the Washington Mutual Common Stock received by them in the Merger pursuant to Rule 145.   

 7.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Washington Mutual shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Washington Mutual Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.   

 7.7 _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.   

 (a) Washington Mutual shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, (i) give those employees who are, as of the Effective Time, employed by Providian and its subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") full credit for purposes of    ##### 

  

 

eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under any employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by Washington Mutual, the Surviving Corporation or
any subsidiary of Washington Mutual or the Surviving
Corporation (collectively, the " _Washington Mutual Plans_ "), other than the
Washington Mutual Pension Plan, Washington Mutual Supplemental Executive
Retirement Accumulation Plan, Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan, the
Washington Mutual Executive Target Retirement Income Plan, the
Washington Mutual Retiree Welfare Plan or any "final average pay" defined
benefit pension plan (collectively, the " _Excluded Plans_ "), for such
Continuing Employees service with Providian or any subsidiary of Providian
(or any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by Providian
and its subsidiaries, and (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any
Washington Mutual Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, and (iii) provide
credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which
any transfer of coverage occurs; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in
the duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, for
purposes of the Excluded Plans, Washington Mutual shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to give the Continuing Employees
credit for eligibility and vesting for purposes of the Washington Mutual
Retiree Welfare Plan and the Washington Mutual Pension Plan.    

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, and subject to the immediately following sentence, Washington Mutual shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, provide to the Continuing Employees with compensation and benefit arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefit arrangements that are provided to similarly situated employees of Washington Mutual. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, cause the Continuing Employees to commence participation in such Washington Mutual Plans as are provided to similarly situated employees of Washington Mutual, and provided, further, that each Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated during the twelve-month period following the Effective Time (other than those individuals identified in Section 4.11(a) of the Providian Disclosure Schedule as having an employment, change of control, severance or similar type of agreement) shall be entitled to receive severance pay and benefits that a similarly situated employee of Washington Mutual would receive under the applicable Washington Mutual Plan that is a severance plan. In addition to the foregoing, with respect to all Paid Time Off (as such term is defined to include vacation, volunteer time, funeral time, school conferences, sick time and personal time, but not including sabbatical leave) that has been accrued through the Effective Time (" _PTO_ ") by any Continuing Employee under the applicable PTO Plan, Washington Mutual shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, at its discretion, either pay the Continuing Employee his or her PTO as soon as practicable after the Effective Time or allow such Continuing Employee to convert such PTO into vacation or sick leave (or a combination thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such converted PTO may be subject to a maximum cap, with any excess PTO to be paid in cash to the Continuing Employee as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. By no later than the date on which the Continuing Employees are placed on the Washington Mutual payroll system, the Continuing Employees shall receive a cash payment equal to their respective sabbatical leave accrued through the relevant payment date thereof. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this    ##### 

  

 

Section 7.7 to the contrary, nothing set forth in this Section 7.7 shall give
rise to the duplication of any benefits to any Continuing Employee.    

 (c) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former employees or directors, consultants or independent contractors of any of Providian or any of its subsidiaries, Washington Mutual or any of its subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 7.7) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 7.7 or elsewhere in the Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and after the Effective Time, the termination of employment of any individual Continuing Employee or, subject to the provisions of Section 7.7(a), any change in the employee benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Plan in accordance with its terms.   

 7.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Providian or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of Providian, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, trust or other enterprise or (ii) this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified Party in connection herewith, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Washington Mutual shall indemnify and hold harmless each such Indemnified Party, to the fullest extent to which such Indemnified Party would be entitled under applicable law and the By-Laws of Providian as in effect on the date of this Agreement, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable law, from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.8, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Washington Mutual thereof, _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Washington Mutual under this Section 7.8 except (and only) to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices Washington Mutual.    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this Section 7.8, Washington Mutual agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in Providians Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or in the corresponding constituent documents of any of Providians Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 7.8(b) shall be deemed to preclude the liquidation, consolidation or merger of Providian or any Subsidiary thereof, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation or merger and shall constitute rights which may be asserted against Washington Mutual.   

 (c) Washington Mutual shall use its best efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and directors of Providian immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date by the directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies maintained by Providian ( _provided_ that (x) Washington Mutual may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate no less advantageous to such directors and officers of Providian than the terms and conditions of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of Providian, and (y) in no event will Washington Mutual be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by Providian for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided_ _further_ , that if Washington Mutual is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.8(c) as a result of the preceding clause (y), Washington Mutual shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Insurance Amount) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such.   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   

 7.9 _Advice of Changes_. Washington Mutual and Providian shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with other such changes or events, has a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in Section 8 or give rise to any right of termination under Section 9 unless the underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right.   

 7.10 _No Solicitation_.   

 (a) None of Providian, Providians Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and affiliates (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any    ##### 

  

 

negotiations concerning, or provide any nonpublic information to, or have
any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
waive any provision of or amend the terms of the Rights Agreement (or redeem
the rights issued thereunder) in respect of an Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill" or similar obligation of any person other than Washington Mutual
or its affiliates or (v) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing; _provided_ that, in the event Providian receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal and Providians Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, prior to the
Providian Stockholders Meeting Providian may, and may permit its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to, take any action described in clause
(ii) above to the extent that the Board of Directors of Providian concludes
in good faith (based on the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to
take such actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided_ _further_ that (x) prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, Providian shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such third party on terms no less favorable to Providian than
the Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) Providian shall also furnish to
Washington Mutual a copy of any confidential data or information that it is
furnishing to any third party pursuant to this Section 7.10(a) to the extent
not previously furnished to Washington Mutual. Providian will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations it or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives may have conducted before the date of this Agreement with any
persons other than Washington Mutual with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and will use its (and will cause its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
to use their) reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring
the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential
information previously furnished by Providian or such Subsidiaries or
Representatives thereunder and by using its reasonable best efforts to
obtain injunctions or other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms thereof in
a court of competent jurisdiction. Providian will promptly (within one
Business Day) advise Washington Mutual following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, or of any request for nonpublic information or access
to the books and records of Providian in connection with a possible
Acquisition Proposal, describing the substance thereof (including the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or request for
information or access), and will keep Washington Mutual apprised of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and any material changes thereto) on a
current basis (and in any event no later than 48 hours after the
occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations). Without
limiting the foregoing, Providian shall promptly, and in any event within 24
hours, notify Washington Mutual orally and in writing if it determines to
begin providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Section 7.10.    

 (b) Providian agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.10 by any Representative of Providian or any of its Subsidiaries, at the direction or    ##### 

  

 

with the consent or prior knowledge or awareness of Providian or its
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.10 by
Providian.    

 7.11 _Subsequent Interim and Financial Statements_. As soon as reasonably practicable and as soon as they are available, but in no event more than 15 days, after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, Providian shall furnish to Washington Mutual (i) consolidated and consolidating financial statements (including balance sheet, income statement and statement of changes in stockholders equity) of Providian and its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended and (ii) any key internal management reports relating to the foregoing. All information furnished by Providian to Washington Mutual pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall be held in confidence by Washington Mutual to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.   

 7.12 _Reorganization_. Neither Washington Mutual nor Providian shall take, or cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take, any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   

 7.13 _Exemption From Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Assuming that Providian delivers to Washington Mutual the Section 16 Information (as defined below) reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Washington Mutual, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Providian Insiders (as defined below) of Washington Mutual Common Stock in exchange for shares of Providian Common Stock, and of options to purchase Washington Mutual Common Stock upon conversion of Providian Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information provided by Providian to Washington Mutual prior to the Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information accurate in all respects regarding the Providian Insiders, the number of shares of Providian Common Stock held by each such Providian Insider and the number and description of the Providian Options held by each such Providian Insider. " _Providian Insiders_ " shall mean those officers and directors of Providian who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.   

 7.14 _Management Consultation Meetings and Distribution of Information_. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Washington Mutual senior manager responsible for the integration of Washington Mutual and Providian set forth on Section 7.14 of the Washington Mutual Disclosure Schedule, and the Providian senior manager responsible for the integration of Washington Mutual and Providian set forth on Section 7.14 of the Washington Mutual Disclosure Schedule, shall confer on a regular basis regarding the business and operations of Washington Mutual and Providian.    #####

 (e) Providian and Washington Mutual agree that the agreement contained in paragraph (b) above is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreement Washington Mutual would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If Providian fails to pay Washington Mutual the amounts due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified in such paragraph (b), Providian shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Washington Mutual in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.   

 9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Providian; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Providians stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the Providian stockholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement or which negatively impacts the intended tax treatment of the holders of Providian Common Stock. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 10.4 _Interpretation_. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and the schedules hereto and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require Providian, Washington Mutual or any of their respective officers, directors, Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted. All schedules accompanying this Agreement and all information specifically referenced in any such schedule form an integral part of this Agreement, and references to this Agreement include reference to them.   

 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.   

 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the documents, schedules and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.   

 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law provisions (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal law or the DGCL are applicable).    ##### 

  

  

 10.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.   

 10.9 _Publicity_. Washington Mutual and Providian shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement or SEC filing as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE. Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, Washington Mutual and Providian shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party. In addition, Providian and its Subsidiaries shall (a) consult with Washington Mutual regarding communications with customers, stockholders, prospective investors and employees related to the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) provide Washington Mutual with stockholder lists of Providian and (c) allow and facilitate Washington Mutual contact with stockholders of Providian and other prospective investors.   

 10.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 7.8 hereof, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
