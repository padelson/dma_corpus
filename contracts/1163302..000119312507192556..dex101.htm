EXHIBIT B  Arrangement Resolution

 |  | _ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENT_

ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of August 26, 2007 (this "Agreement"), by and
among UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
1344973 ALBERTA ULC, a corporation existing under the laws of Alberta and an
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Subco"), and STELCO INC., a
corporation existing under the laws of Canada (the "Company"). Capitalized
terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in
Article X, or in the applicable Section of this Agreement to which reference
is made in Article X.

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties
hereto intend to propose a statutory plan of arrangement under the
CBCA pursuant to which Parent will cause Subco to, and Subco will, acquire
all of the outstanding common shares in the capital stock of the Company (the
"Company Shares") for $38.50 per Company Share in cash on the terms set forth
in the Plan of Arrangement attached hereto as Exhibit A;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") desires
to support and facilitate the Plan of Arrangement on the terms set forth in
this Agreement and has unanimously concluded, after receiving financial and
legal advice and following the receipt and review of recommendations from its
special committee of directors (the "Special Committee"), that it is in the
best interests of the Company and the holders of Company Shares (the
"Shareholders") to enter into this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
Shareholders, holding an aggregate of 20,887,548 Company Shares (being
approximately 77% of the issued and outstanding Company Shares) are each
entering into a support agreement with Parent (the "Support Agreement"). 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE ARRANGEMENT

1.1 _The Arrangement_. The parties hereto agree, on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, to carry out the Arrangement in accordance
with this Agreement on the terms set out in the Plan of Arrangement, subject
to such changes as may be mutually agreed to by the parties in accordance
with this Agreement, provided however, that no such change shall result in
the Shareholders, Optionholders or Warrantholders receiving cash consideration
per security less than that provided in Section 1.13    as unamended on the date hereof, or having less than all of the outstanding
Company Shares, Options and Warrants be acquired. The parties will not add to
or amend the conditions to the Arrangement set forth in Article VII unless
such addition or amendment is made in response to an action by the Court in
connection with its consideration of the Arrangement or the Plan of
Arrangement.

1.2 _Implementation Steps by the Company_. The Company covenants in favour of
Subco and Parent that the Company shall:

(a) file the initial press release contemplated by Section 6.2, together with
a material change report in prescribed form and a copy of this Agreement as a
material contract, with applicable securities regulatory authorities in each
province of Canada;

(b) as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and in any event no later than 15 Business Days from the date
of this Agreement, bring an application before the Court pursuant to section
192 of the CBCA for the Interim Order in a manner and form acceptable to
Parent, acting reasonably, providing for, _inter alia_ , the calling and
holding of the Company Meeting, and thereafter proceed with such application
and diligently pursue obtaining the Interim Order in such form;

(c) fix a record date for the purposes of determining the Shareholders
entitled to receive notice of the Company Meeting in accordance with the
Interim Order;

(d) subject to obtaining the Interim Order, convene and hold the Company
Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event on or before
November 5, 2007 in accordance with the Interim Order and Applicable Law for
the purpose of having Shareholders consider the Arrangement Resolution and for
any other proper purpose as may be set out in the Circular (as agreed to with
the prior written consent of Parent, acting reasonably and in manner
consistent with the purpose of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby); provided that: 

(i) the Company Meeting shall be held regardless of whether the Board
determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or
recommends that the Shareholders reject the Arrangement Resolution or any
other Change of Recommendation has occurred at any time; and

(ii) the Arrangement Resolution shall be voted on before any other matter at
the Company Meeting, unless otherwise previously agreed to in writing by
Parent or required by a Governmental Entity;

(e) except to the extent required by a Governmental Entity or for quorum
purposes (in the case of an adjournment) or an adjournment pursuant to
Section 4.3(c)(iii), not adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose the
adjournment, postponement or cancellation of) the Company Meeting without
Parents prior written consent, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to Section
1.2(d) and this Section 1.2(e) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any
other person of any Third Party Proposal;



 

-2- (f) include in the Circular the unanimous recommendation of the members of the
Board entitled to vote that the Shareholders vote in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution (it being understood that such recommendation may be
modified or withdrawn in the event of a Change of Recommendation permitted by
Section 4.3(c));

 

(g) solicit from Shareholders proxies in favour of the approval of the
Arrangement Resolution and against any resolution submitted by any other
Shareholder including, if so requested by Parent, using the services of
dealers and proxy solicitation services, and take all other actions that are
reasonably necessary or desirable to seek the approval of the Arrangement by
the Shareholders, provided that if there has been a Change of Recommendation
the Company shall not be required to continue to solicit proxies but shall
continue to be required to hold the Company Meeting in accordance with Section
1.2(d); 

(h) take all reasonable steps necessary to allow Parent and any Subsidiary of
Parent, directly or through representatives, to solicit, in accordance with
Applicable Law, from Shareholders proxies in favour of the approval of the
Arrangement Resolution, provided that any such solicitation shall be in a
manner approved by the Company acting reasonably and, if there is a Change of
Recommendation, as is permitted by Applicable Law;

(i) provide notice to Parent of the Company Meeting and, subject to
Applicable Law, allow representatives of Parent to attend and speak at the
Company Meeting;

(j) subject to obtaining all approvals as required by the Interim Order,
bring an application as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company
Meeting but in any event not later than three Business Days thereafter, before
the Court pursuant to section 192 of the CBCA for the Final Order in a manner
and form acceptable to Parent, acting reasonably, and thereafter proceed with
and diligently pursue obtaining the Final Order in such form;

(k) subject to obtaining the Final Order and the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, send to the Director, for endorsement
and filing by the Director, the Articles of Arrangement and such other
documents as may be required in connection therewith under the CBCA to give
effect to the Arrangement pursuant to section 192 of the CBCA in a manner and
form acceptable to Parent, acting reasonably;

(l) permit Parent (and its counsel) to review and comment upon drafts of
all material to be filed by the Company with the Court, the Director or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Arrangement (including the Circular
and any supplement or amendment contemplated by Section 1.5) prior to the
service (if applicable) and/or filing of such materials, give Parent and its
counsel reasonable time to review and comment upon such materials and accept
any reasonable comments of Parent and its  



 

-3-  counsel. The Company shall also provide to Parents counsel on a timely
basis copies of any notice of appearance or other Court documents served on
the Company in respect of the application for the Interim Order or the Final
Order or any appeal therefrom and of any notice, whether written or oral,
received by the Company indicating any intention to oppose the granting of the
Interim Order or the Final Order or to appeal the Interim Order or the Final
Order;

(m) instruct counsel acting for the Company to bring the applications
referred to in Section 1.2(b) and Section 1.2(j) in cooperation with counsel
to Parent; and

(n) not: (i) file any material with the Court in connection with the
Arrangement or serve any such material, and not agree to modify or amend
materials so filed or served; or (ii) send to the Director, for endorsement
and filing by the Director, the Articles of Arrangement, except, in either
case, as contemplated hereby or with Parents prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

1.3 _Interim Order_. The notice of motion for the application for the Interim
Order referred to in Section 1.2(b) shall request that the Interim Order
provide:

(a) for confirmation of the record date for the Company Meeting;

(b) for the classes of Persons to whom notice is to be provided in respect of
the Arrangement and the Company Meeting and for the manner in which such
notice is to be provided;

(c) that the requisite approval for the Arrangement Resolution shall be two-
thirds of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by those entitled to
vote that are present in person or by proxy at the Company Meeting;

(d) that, in all other respects, the terms, restrictions and conditions of the
Companys articles and bylaws, including quorum requirements and all other
matters, shall apply in respect of the Company Meeting; 

(e) for the grant of the Dissent Rights as contemplated in the Plan of
Arrangement;

(f) for the notice requirements with respect to the making of the application
to the Court for the Final Order; and

(g) for such other matters as Parent and the Company may agree or Parent or
Subco may reasonably require subject to obtaining the prior consent of the
Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

1.4 _Articles of Arrangement_. The Articles of Arrangement shall, upon the
endorsement of a certificate thereon by the Director under section 192(7) of
the CBCA, with such other matters as are necessary to effect the Arrangement
and subject to the provisions of the Plan of Arrangement, consummate the Plan
of Arrangement. The Articles of Arrangement shall be prepared in draft prior
to the mailing of the Circular and shall be in form satisfactory to Parent.



 

-4- 1.5 _Circular_. As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Company, in consultation with Parent, will prepare and
complete the Circular together with any other documents required by the CBCA
or other Applicable Law in connection with the Arrangement and the Company
Meeting. The Company Circular and such other documents, together with any
amendments thereto, shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent
acting reasonably provided that Parent acknowledges that the contents of the
Company Circular must ultimately be determined by the Company acting
reasonably in all the circumstances. The Company will file the Circular and
any other documentation required to be filed under the Interim Order and
Applicable Law in all jurisdictions where the Circular is required to be filed
by the Company and mail or cause to be mailed the Circular and any other
documentation required to be mailed under the Interim Order and Applicable Law
to Shareholders, the directors of the Company, the auditors of the Company and
any other required Persons on or before September 27, 2007, all in accordance
with the terms of the Interim Order and Applicable Law. In a timely and
expeditious manner, the Company shall prepare (in consultation with Parent)
and file amendments or supplements to the Circular (which amendments or
supplements shall be in a form satisfactory to Parent and its counsel, acting
reasonably) required by Applicable Law or as otherwise agreed between the
Company and Parent with respect to the Company Meeting and mail or
otherwise disseminate such amendments or supplements, as required by the
Interim Order and in accordance with all Applicable Law, to such persons and
in all jurisdictions where such amendments or supplements are required to be
mailed or disseminated, complying in all material respects with all
Applicable Law on the date of the mailing or dissemination thereof.

1.6 _Preparation of Filings, etc._

(a) The Company shall (in consultation with Parent and its counsel) diligently
do all such acts and things as may be necessary to comply, in all material
respects, with National Instrument 54-101  " _Communication with Beneficial
Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer_ " in relation to the Company
Meeting and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall, in
consultation with Parent, use all reasonable efforts to benefit from the
accelerated timing contemplated by such instrument.

(b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in: (i) the preparation of the
Circular as described in Section 1.5; (ii) the preparation and filing of any
exemption or other applications or orders and any other documents required by
either of them to discharge their respective obligations under Applicable Law
in connection with the Arrangement; and (iii) the taking of all such action
as may be required under any applicable Securities Laws or the CBCA in
connection with the Arrangement and the Plan of Arrangement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish to the other of them, on a
timely basis, all information as may be reasonably required to effect the
actions contemplated by Section 1.6(a) and Section 1.6(b), and each covenants
that no information  



 

-5-  so furnished by it in writing in connection with those actions or otherwise
in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement will contain
any Misrepresentation. Each of the parties hereto will ensure that the
information relating to it and its Subsidiaries, which is provided in the
Circular, will not contain any Misrepresentation.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other of them if,
at any time before the Effective Time, it becomes aware that the Circular or
an application for the Interim Order, the Final Order or any other filing
under Applicable Law contains a Misrepresentation or otherwise requires an
amendment or supplement to the Circular or such application. In any such
event, each of the parties hereto will co-operate in the preparation of a
supplement or amendment to the Circular or such other document, as the case
may be, that corrects that Misrepresentation, and the Company will cause the
same to be distributed or otherwise communicated to the Shareholders in
accordance with the Interim Order, the directors of the Company, the auditors
of the Company and any other required Persons and filed as required under
Applicable Law.

(e) The Company shall ensure that the Circular provides Shareholders with
information in sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment
concerning the matters to be placed before them at the Company Meeting and
include in the Circular a statement that the Board has unanimously determined
that the Arrangement is in the best interests of the Company and that
the Board unanimously recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution (as contemplated by Section 1.2(f)).

1.7  _Dissenting Shareholders_. The Plan of Arrangement shall provide that
registered Shareholders may exercise Dissent Rights with respect to their
Company Shares in connection with the Arrangement pursuant to and in the
manner set forth in the Interim Order and the Plan of Arrangement. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written notice of a dissent,
withdrawal of such notice, and any other instruments served pursuant to such
Dissent Rights and received by the Company. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such notice of dissent unless Parent shall have given its prior written
consent to such payment or settlement offer.

1.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may, at any time and from time to time before
and after the holding of the Company Meeting, but not later than
the Effective Time, be amended by mutual written agreement of the parties
hereto, without, subject to Applicable Law, further notice to or authorization
on the part of the Shareholders, and any such amendment may, without
limitation:

(a) change the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the parties, including an extension of the Outside Date; 

(b) waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation or warranty contained
herein or in any document to be delivered pursuant hereto;



 

-6- (c) waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants contained herein or
waive or modify the performance of any of the obligations of the parties; and

(d) waive compliance with and modify any conditions precedent contained
herein,

provided, however, that after receipt of approval of the Arrangement
Resolution by the Shareholders, there shall be no amendment that by
Applicable Law requires further approval by the Shareholders without further
approval of such Shareholders.

1.9 _List of Shareholders, Warrantholders and Optionholders_. At the
reasonable request of Parent from time to time, the Company shall provide
Parent with a list (in both written and electronic form) of the registered
Shareholders, together with their addresses and respective holdings of Company
Shares, with a list of the names and addresses and holdings of all Persons
having rights issued by the Company to acquire Company Shares
(including Optionholders and registered Warrantholders) and a list of non-
objecting beneficial owners of Company Shares or Warrants, together with their
addresses and respective holdings of Company Shares or Warrants. The Company
shall from time to time require that its registrar and transfer agent furnish
Parent with such additional information, including updated or additional lists
of Shareholders and lists of holdings and other assistance as Parent may
reasonably request.

1.10 _Withholding_. The Company, Parent, Subco, one or more other Subsidiaries
of Parent or the Depositary, as the case may be, shall be entitled
to directly or indirectly deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement to any
Shareholder, Optionholder or Warrantholder such amounts as are entitled or
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Tax Act or any other provision of domestic or foreign
(whether national, federal, provincial, state, local or otherwise) Applicable
Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity directly or
indirectly by the Company, Parent, Subco or one or more Subsidiaries of Parent
or the Depositary, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement as having been paid to the Shareholders, Optionholders or
Warrantholders, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Company, Parent, Subco, one or more Subsidiaries
of Parent or the Depositary, as the case may be, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity within
the time required and in accordance with the Tax Act or any other provision
of domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, provincial, state, local or
otherwise) Applicable Law relating to Taxes.

1.11 _Alternative Transaction Structure_. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent to
successfully implement and complete any alternative transaction structure
that: (a) does not have negative financial consequences to the Company and
its Subsidiaries in any material respect, would provide Shareholders,
Optionholders and Warrantholders with cash consideration not less than the  



 

-7-  cash consideration per security receivable under Section 1.13 herein and
would provide for the acquisition of all of the outstanding Company
Shares, Options and Warrants; (b) would reasonably be expected to be
completed prior to the Outside Date; and (c) is otherwise on terms and
conditions no more onerous in any material respect than the Arrangement and
this Agreement. In the event that the transaction structure is so modified,
the relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be modified as necessary in
order that they shall apply with full force and effect, _mutatis mutandis_ ,
but with the adjustments necessary to reflect the revised transaction
structure, and the parties hereto shall execute and deliver an agreement in
writing giving effect to and evidencing such amendments as may be reasonably
required as a result of such modifications and adjustments.

 

1.12 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP, 1
First Canadian Place, Toronto, Ontario, M5X 1B8, as soon as possible, but in
any event no later than two Business Days after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), or on such other
date or at such other place as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
(the "Closing Date").

1.13 _Consideration_. The Articles of Arrangement shall provide that the
Shareholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders shall receive the following
consideration:

(a) $38.50 in cash per Company Share (the "Share Consideration");

(b) for each Option outstanding as of the Effective Time, a cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Share Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
Company Shares issuable upon exercise of such Option (with the aggregate
amount rounded down to the nearest cent); and

(c) for each Warrant outstanding as of the Effective Time, a cash payment
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Share Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the
number of Company Shares issuable upon exercise of such Warrant (with the
aggregate amount rounded down to the nearest cent).

If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
or any similar event, the Share Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent
appropriate to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event.

each Product manufactured, sold, distributed, provided, shipped or licensed,
or service rendered, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been in
conformity with all applicable contractual commitments and warranties, (ii)
there is no material design, manufacturing or other defects, latent or
otherwise, with respect to any Products and (iii) each Product that has been
manufactured, sold, distributed, provided, shipped or licensed prior to
Closing contains all warnings required by Applicable Law and such warnings
are in accordance with reasonable industry practice.

(c) The Company is not aware of any pattern or series of claims against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to
result in a generalized product recall relating to the Products, regardless of
whether such product recall is formal, informal, voluntary or involuntary.

knowledge of the Company, other) notice that any customer, supplier,
distributor or sales representative intends to cancel, terminate or otherwise
modify or not renew its relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such action has been
threatened, which in either case, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or other agreement or arrangement designed to have the effect of delaying,
deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of the Company.

of the Arrangement Resolution by the Shareholders, in response to an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Third Party Proposal made after the date
hereof that the Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its financial advisors and outside counsel) constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may, after giving Parent
prompt notice of such determination, (i) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Third Party
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality and
standstill agreement on  



 

-38-  terms no less favourable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and containing additional provisions that expressly
permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 (a copy of
which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly (and in all events within 24
hours) provided for informational purposes only to Parent); _provided_ ,

entering into discussions or negotiations with any Person, the Company
notifies Parent promptly of any such inquiry, proposal or offer received by,
any such information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its officers,
directors, Employees, advisors and agents indicating, in connection with such
notice, the material terms and conditions of the Third Party Proposal, the
identity of the Person making such Third Party Proposal and provides a copy of
any written Third Party Proposal and (B) all such information (to the extent
such information has not been previously provided or otherwise made available
to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be,
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made available to
such Person, as the case may be, and (ii) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Third Party Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Third Party Proposal; _provided_ , _that_ the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status and material terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of
any such discussions or negotiations and will notify Parent promptly of any
determination by the Board that a Superior Proposal has been made. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited
written _bona fide_ Third Party Proposal pursuant to which a Person or Persons
(or their stockholders) would own, if consummated, all of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole on terms that the Board determines, in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisors, that such Third Party Proposal (i)
is not subject to any financing conditions or, if any financing is required,
financing satisfactory to the Company is committed, (ii) is more favourable
to the Shareholders from a financial point of view than the terms of the
Arrangement, and (iii) without regard to any support agreement between the
Parent and any Shareholder, is reasonably likely to be completed on the
terms proposed.

withdraw, amend, change, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or

of advisability by the Board or any such committee of this Agreement or the
Arrangement, or recommend, or propose publicly to recommend, the approval or

action (each, a "Change of Recommendation"), unless all of the following
conditions are satisfied:

(i) a Superior Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn;

(ii) the Company Meeting has not occurred;



 

-39- (iii) the Company shall have provided at least five Business Days prior

Proposal) and (C) that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the
manner in which it intends to do so and in the event that the Company Meeting
is to be held within such Notice Period, the Company Meeting will be
