(a) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an effective
election to receive stock has been made and not revoked (each such share, a
"Stock Electing Company Share") shall be converted into the right to receive
3.461 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock
Election Consideration"), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.3;
and

(b) Each other share of Company Common Stock that is not convertible pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to $12.25 in cash without interest (the "Cash Election Consideration").

2.2  _Elections_.

(a) Each Person (other than Parent, Company and Merger Sub) who, as of the
Election Deadline, is a record holder of Company Common Stock will be
entitled, with respect to all or a portion of such shares of Company Common
Stock, to make an unconditional election (a "Stock Election"), on or prior to
the Election Deadline, to receive the Stock Election Consideration on the
basis hereinafter set forth.

(b) Prior to the date the Registration Statement is mailed to the holders of
Company Common Stock, Parent shall prepare a form of election, which form
shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (an "Election
Form") pursuant to which a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
as of the Election Deadline may make a Stock Election with respect to all or a
portion of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder on the
Closing Date. The Election Form shall be mailed with the Registration
Statement to the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date
for the Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
make the Election Form and the Registration Statement available to
all persons who become record holders of Company Common Stock during the
period between such record date and the Election Deadline, including using
reasonable efforts to mail an Election Form to all such persons who become
record holders of Company Common Stock prior to the seventh Business Day
prior to the Election Deadline.

(c) A Stock Election shall be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have
received no later than 5:00 p.m., California time, on the date that is two
Business Days preceding the Closing Date (the "Election Deadline"), an
Election Form covering the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Stock
Election applies, executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
set forth in such Election Form. Any share of Company Common Stock with
respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective
Stock Election meeting the requirements of this Section 2.2(c) by the
Election Deadline shall be deemed not to be a Stock Electing Company Share. A
Stock Election may be revoked or changed only by delivering to the Exchange
Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written notice of revocation or, in
the case of a change, a properly completed revised Election Form that
identifies the shares of Company Common Stock to which such revised Election
Form applies, or in the case of a revocation after the Election Deadline,
such revocation shall be effected if (and only to the extent that) the
Exchange Agent is legally required to permit revocations and only if the
Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. Delivery to
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline of a revised Election Form
with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock shall result in the
revocation of all prior Election Forms with respect to all such shares of
Company Common Stock. Any termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VIII shall result in the revocation of all Election Forms delivered to
the Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of such termination.

(d) The determination of the Exchange Agent in its sole discretion shall be
binding as to whether or not elections to receive the Stock Election
Consideration have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.2
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and when elections and
revocations were received by it. The Exchange Agent shall also make
all computations as to the proration contemplated by Section 2.3, and absent
manifest error any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ that under
no circumstances shall the number of  



 

3  shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement be such as
to require approval of the holders of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
rules and regulations of The New York Stock Exchange. The Exchange Agent may,
with the mutual agreement of Parent and the Company, make rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity and
effectiveness of Election Forms and the manner and extent to which Stock
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations required
by this Article.

2.3  _Proration of Stock Election Consideration_.

(a) The number of shares of Company Common Stock eligible to be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration at the Effective
Time shall not exceed the number of shares of Company Common Stock which is
equal to the Maximum Stock Election Number, where:

(i) "Maximum Stock Election Number" shall mean the result obtained (rounding
down to the nearest whole share) by dividing the Parent Shares Available by
the Exchange Ratio.

(ii) "Parent Shares Available" shall mean the result obtained by subtracting
the Assumed Option Shares from the Maximum Parent Shares Issuable.

(iii) "Assumed Option Shares" shall mean the sum of (1) the result obtained
(rounding up to the nearest whole share) by multiplying (A) the number of
options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock assumed by Parent at the
Effective Time pursuant to the Merger by (B) the Option Ratio (as defined in
Section 6.9(a)) and (2) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 6.9(b).

(iv) "Maximum Parent Shares Issuable" shall mean the result obtained (rounding
down to the nearest whole share) by multiplying (1) 0.1995 by (2) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time.

(b) If the number of Stock Electing Company Shares exceeds the Maximum Stock
Election Number, then such Stock Electing Company Shares shall be treated in
the following manner at the Effective Time:

(i) A stock proration factor (the "Stock Proration Factor") shall be
determined by dividing the Maximum Stock Election Number by the total number
of Stock Electing Company Shares.

(ii) The number of Stock Electing Company Shares covered by a Company
stockholders Stock Election shall be reduced to a number equal to the product
(rounding down to the nearest whole Stock Electing Company Share) of (x) the
Stock Proration Factor, multiplied by (y) the total number of Stock Electing
Company Shares covered by such Stock Election (such product, the "Prorated
Stock Election"), and the number of Company shares equal to the Prorated Stock
Election shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Election
Consideration.

(iii) Each Stock Electing Company Share, other than those shares of Company
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Stock Election
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.3 (b)(ii), shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration as if such Shares of
Company Common Stock were not Stock Electing Company Shares.

(c) If the number of Stock Electing Company Shares is less than or equal to
the Maximum Stock Election Number, then each Stock Electing Company Share
shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration,
and each other share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.6) shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration.

(d) In the event that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement (as calculated in accordance with the rules and
regulations of The New York Stock Exchange) would otherwise require approval
of the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock, the Stock Proration Factor
and the Prorated Stock Election shall be adjusted, in good faith, by the
Exchange Agent or Parent to allow for  



 

4  the issuance of the maximum number of shares of Parent Common Stock
permissible that would not, in accordance with the rules and requirements of
The New York Stock Exchange, require approval of the holders of shares of
Parent Common Stock.

2.4 _Repurchase Rights_. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company
("Company Unvested Common Stock"), then, the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable with respect to such shares of Company Unvested Common Stock pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.1 shall be withheld and retained by Parent and
shall be subject to permanent retention by Parent (i.e., forfeiture by the
former holder of such shares of Company Unvested Common Stock) on the same
terms that governed such Company Unvested Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall hold the Merger Consideration so withheld until such Merger
Consideration is no longer subject to the possibility of permanent retention
by Parent, at which time such withheld Merger Consideration will be paid to
the former holders of the applicable Company Unvested Common Stock on a
monthly basis, as reasonably determined by Parent. For holders of Company
Common Stock who have elected to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration
in Parent Common Stock and a portion in cash, such monthly payments shall be
made in the same proportions as set forth in the applicable Stock Election,
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.3.

2.5 _Non-Employee Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option held by any Person other than
an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by any Person listed
on Schedule 2.5(a) (each such Company Option, a "Non-Employee Option"), for
which such Person has (1) validly exercised such Non-Employee Option prior to
the Election Deadline and (2) made a Stock Election in compliance with Section
2.1 hereof shall be entitled to receive Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1. Any Non-Employee Option held by a Person who has not
fulfilled the conditions of the immediately preceding sentence, including any
Non-Employee Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, terminate in its entirety at the
Effective Time, and the holder of such terminated Non-Employee Option shall
be entitled to receive therefor an amount of cash (rounded down to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock as to which such Non-Employee Option was vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time (giving effect to any acceleration of
vesting resulting from the Merger), multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Cash Election Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such Non-Employee Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Any materials to be submitted to the holders of Non-Employee Options
shall be subject to prior review and approval by Parent.

2.6 _Cancellation of Subsidiary and Parent Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held by the Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

2.7 _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value
per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of
such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.8 _Employee Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. At the Effective
Time, all Company Options, other than Non-Employee Options, outstanding under
each Company Stock Option Plan shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 6.9. Rights outstanding under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company (collectively,
the "Company Purchase Plans") shall be treated as set forth in Section 6.9(c).



 

5 2.9 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

2.10  _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary
other than Section 2.10(b), any shares of Company Common Stock held by a
holder who has demanded and perfected dissenters rights for such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 23B.13 of Washington Law and who, as
of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters
rights (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company
Common Stock set forth in Section 2.1, but instead shall be converted into
the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares under Washington Law. From and after
the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the
Surviving Corporation nor of a stockholder of the Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.10(a), if any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who demands dissenters rights for such shares under
Washington Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) the right to dissent with respect to such shares, then, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holders shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive the consideration
for Company Common Stock, as applicable, set forth in Section 2.1, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for dissenters rights of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Washington Law and
received by the Company which relate to any such demand for dissenters
rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time with respect to
demands for dissenters rights under Washington Law. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any
communication to be made by the Company to any holder of Company Common Stock
with respect to such demands shall be prepared in advance in cooperation with
Parent.

2.11 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent")
for the purpose of (i) receiving Election Forms and determining, in accordance
with this Article II, the form of Merger Consideration to be received by each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) exchanging the applicable
Merger Consideration for shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration_. Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Exchange Agent that shall provide that Parent shall at the
Effective Time make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance
with this Article II the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1
in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Exchange Fund." For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall
assume that there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver Parent
Common Stock and cash contemplated to be issued out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund may not be used for any other purpose. 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective
Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates")  



 

6  which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate,
subject to Section 2.11(g), shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1 hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting part of such Merger
Consideration (if any), at Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-
entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares
of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under applicable law. Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of
the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been so converted.

(d) _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or under any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the
amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.11, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

(f) _Dividends and Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock constituting part of the Merger
Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in
Section 2.11(h), shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not
surrendered until such Certificates are surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, as provided in this Section. Subject to applicable law, following
such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the
time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section
2.11(h) and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such
surrender with respect to such securities and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities. 

(g) _Payments to Persons Other than a Registered Holder_. If any portion of
the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that a holder of shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be  



 

7  aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such
holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash,
without interest, determined by multiplying such fractional share by the
closing price of Parent Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash to be paid to such former holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of
any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall notify Parent, and Parent
shall ensure that there is deposited with the Exchange Agent and shall cause
the Exchange Agent to make available in accordance with this Agreement such
amounts to such former holders of Company Common Stock.

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund in direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or
otherwise with the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), on a daily basis; _provided_ that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company
stockholders pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant
to this Article II shall promptly be paid to Parent.

(j) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six months after the
Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates
who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section
2.11 shall after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation, subject to
Section 2.11(f), look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration (and as a general creditor for the cash
constituting the Merger Consideration, which cash shall not accrue interest)
pursuant to Section 2.1 with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

2.13 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such cash and/or
Parent Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

2.14 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.



 

8 ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the
exceptions specifically disclosed in the disclosure letter (referencing the
appropriate section or subsection of this Agreement, as applicable) supplied
by the Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof and certified by a duly
authorized executive officer of the Company (the "Company Disclosure Letter"),
as follows:

3.1 _Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents; Subsidiaries_.

(a) _Organization; Standing and Power_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other organization duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization (except, in the case of good standing, for
entities organized under the laws of any jurisdiction that does not recognize
such concept) and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted and
as currently contemplated to be conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing and in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary," when used with respect to any
party, shall mean any corporation, association, business entity, partnership,
limited liability company or other Person of which such party, either alone or
together with one or more Subsidiaries or by one or more Subsidiaries (i)
directly or indirectly owns or controls securities or other interests
representing more than 50% of the voting power of such Person, or (ii) is
entitled, by Contract or otherwise, to elect, appoint or designate directors
constituting a majority of the members of such Persons board of directors or
other governing body. For purposes of this Agreement, "Contract" shall mean
any written, oral or other agreement, contract, subcontract, settlement
agreement, lease, binding understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty,
purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan or legally
binding commitment or undertaking of any nature, as in effect as of the date
hereof or as may hereinafter be in effect.

(b) _Charter Documents_. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent (i) a true and correct copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company, each as amended and/or restated to date (collectively, the
"Company Charter Documents") and (ii) the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or like organizational documents (collectively, "Subsidiary Charter
Documents"), of each of its Subsidiaries, and each such instrument is in full
force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of
the Company Charter Documents and each Subsidiary is not in violation of its
respective Subsidiary Charter Documents.

(c) _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
each Subsidiary of the Company. The Company is the owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, each such Subsidiary and all such shares have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances, options and security interests
of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests, except for restrictions imposed by
applicable securities laws. Other than the Subsidiaries of the Company,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests of any nature in, or any interest
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests of any nature in, any other Person, except for
passive investments of less than 1% in the equity interests of public
companies as part of the Companys cash management program.

3.2 _Capital Structure_.

(a) _Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of Company consists of: (i)
160,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, no par value, and (ii) 4,000,000
shares of undesignated preferred stock, no par value (the "Company Preferred
Stock"). At the close of business on May 1, 2006: (i) 62,031,013 shares of
Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding and (ii) no shares of
Company Preferred Stock were  



 

9  issued or outstanding. No shares of Company Common Stock are owned or held
by any Subsidiary of the Company. All outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
are not subject to preemptive rights created by statute, the Company Charter
Documents, or any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound.

(b) _Company Unvested Common Stock_. There are no commitments or agreements of
any character to which the Company is bound obligating the Company to waive
its right of repurchase or forfeiture with respect to any Company Unvested
Common Stock as a result of the Merger (whether alone or upon the occurrence
of any additional or subsequent events).

(c) _Company Options_. As of the close of business on May 1, 2006: (i)
4,323,477 shares of Company Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock under the Companys 1996
Stock Option Plan, 1997 Stock Option Plan of Pathlight Technology, Inc., 1999
Team Member Plan, Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Compensation
Plan, Outside Directors August 2000 Stock Option Program and 2002 Team Member

(equity or other equity-based awards, other than the Rocksoft retention stock
awards described in Section 6.9(b), whether payable in cash, shares or
otherwise granted under or pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans are
referred to in this Agreement as "Company Options"), the weighted average
exercise price of such Company Options is $9.81 and 2,285,147 such Company
Options are vested and exercisable; (ii) 1,350,103 shares of Company Common
Stock are available for future grant under the Company Stock Option Plans;
(iii) 5,596,629 shares of Company Common Stock are issuable under the Amended

shares of Company Common Stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding options
to purchase Company Common Stock (A) which are issued other than pursuant to
the Company Stock Option Plans and (B) other than shares reserved for issuance
under the Company Purchase Plan; and (v) there are no warrants for the
issuance of Company Common Stock. Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list of each outstanding Non-Employee Option: (a) the
particular Company Stock Option Plan (if any) pursuant to which any such Non-
Employee Option was granted (b) the name of the holder of such Non-Employee
Option, (c) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Non-
Employee Option, (d) the exercise price of such Non-Employee Option, (e) the
date on which such Non-Employee Option was granted, (f) the applicable vesting
schedule, if any, and the extent to which such Non-Employee Option is vested
and exercisable as of the date hereof, and (g) the date on which such Non-
Employee Option expires. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to
issuance under the Company Stock Option Plans and the Company Purchase Plan,
upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, would be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. There are no commitments or agreements of any
character to which the Company is bound obligating the Company to accelerate
the vesting of any Company Option as a result of the Merger (whether alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events). As of the end of
the most recent bi-weekly payroll period ending prior to the date hereof, the
aggregate amount credited to the accounts of participants in the Company
Purchase Plan was $356,292.90 and the aggregate amount credited to such
accounts for such bi-weekly payroll period was $79,942.91. There are no
outstanding or authorized stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit
participation or other similar rights with respect to the Company.

3.4 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

(a) _SEC Filings_. The Company has filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated by reference)
required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2002. All such
required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including those that the Company may file
subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the "Company SEC
Reports." As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports (i)
were prepared in accordance and complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company
SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of  



 

12  the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Companys Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or
other documents with the SEC. The Company has previously furnished to Parent
a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not
yet been filed with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements,
documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by Company
with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The Company
has timely responded to all comment letters of the staff of the SEC relating
to the Company SEC Reports, and the SEC has not advised the Company that any
final responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. The
Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other, since January 1, 2002, including all SEC
comment letters and responses to such comment letters by or on behalf of the
Company. To the Companys Knowledge, none of the Company SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment. The Company and each
of its officers and directors are in compliance with, and have complied, in
each case in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the related
rules and regulations promulgated under or pursuant to such act and (ii) the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"). Each required form, report and document
containing financial statements that has been filed with or submitted to the
SEC by the Company since January 1, 2002, was accompanied by the
certifications required to be filed or submitted by the Companys chief
executive officer and/or chief financial officer, as required, pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its executive officers has
received notice from any Governmental Entity challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing such certifications.

(b) _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Company
SEC Reports (the "Company Financials"), including each Company SEC Report
filed after the date hereof until the Closing: (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be
permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the
Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly and accurately presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of the Companys operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated. The Company does not intend to correct or restate, nor is
there any basis for any correction or restatement of, any aspect of the
Company Financials. The balance sheet of the Company contained in the
Company SEC Reports as of January 31, 2006 is hereinafter referred to as the
"Company Balance Sheet." Except as disclosed in the Company Financials, since
the date of the Company Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance
sheet or in the related notes to the consolidated financial statement prepared
in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities incurred since the date of
the Company Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. The Company has not had any unresolved dispute with any of its
auditors regarding accounting matters or policies during any of its past
three full years or during the current fiscal year-to-date. The books and
records of the Company and each Subsidiary have been, and are being maintained
in all material respects in accordance with applicable legal and accounting
requirements and the Financial Statements are consistent with such books and
records. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of
the Exchange Act).



 

13 (c) _Internal Controls_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has established and maintains, adheres to and enforces a system of internal
controls which are effective in providing assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in

and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that material information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries is
promptly made known to the officers responsible for establishing and
maintaining the system of internal controls; (iii) provide assurance that

Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with
appropriate authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of the
Company; (iv) provide reasonable assurance that access to assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization; (v)
provide reasonable assurance that the reporting of assets is compared with
existing assets at regular intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences; (vi) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (vii)
provide reasonable assurance that any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the Companys management or other Employees who
have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal
controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries, are adequately and
promptly disclosed to the Companys independent auditors and the audit
committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries (including any Employee thereof) nor the Companys
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal controls utilized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves the Companys management or other Employees who have a role in
the preparation of financial statements or the internal controls utilized by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

(d) _Accounting and Auditing Practices_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant, consultant or representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No current or former attorney representing
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the
Company Board or any committee thereof or to any director or executive officer
of the Company.

(e) _Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. To the Companys Knowledge, no
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has provided or is
providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission
or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of
any applicable Legal Requirements of the type described in Section 806 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
director, officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of
the Company or any such Subsidiary has discharged, demoted, suspended,
threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of
employment because of any lawful act of such employee described in Section

(the "Financing"). None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or
modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated by
the Financing Commitments. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to
the agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments, together with the
Companys expected cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient for Parent
and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and to
pay all related fees and expenses.

4.5 _SEC Filings_. Parent has filed all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated by reference)
required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2004. All such
required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including those that Parent may file
subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the "Parent SEC
Reports." As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports (i) were
prepared in accordance and complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.



 

33 4.6 _Financial Statements_. Each of the consolidated financial statements of
Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the
SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act) applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto, and fairly present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended. The books and records of Parent and Parents
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with applicable legal and accounting requirements, and the
consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents are consistent with such books and records. Except as and to the
extent disclosed or reserved against on Parents most recent balance sheet (or
in the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Reports, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance
sheet or in the related notes to a consolidated financial statement prepared
in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities incurred since the date of
Parents most recent balance sheet in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

4.7 _Absence of Changes_. From December 31, 2005 through the date of this
Agreement, Parent has conducted its business in all material respects only in
the ordinary course, and since such date there has not been:

(a) any event or development, condition or occurrence that, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent;

(b) any material change in accounting methods, principles or practices by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, except insofar as may have been required by a
change in GAAP; or

(c) any settlement or compromise by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary of any
material Tax liability or refund.

4.8 _Information Supplied_.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement shall at the time the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC (or, with respect to any post-effective
amendment or supplement, at the time such post-effective amendment or
supplement becomes effective) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
thereunder.

(b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or the Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, on each relevant filing date, on the date of mailing to
the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by Parent which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Section 4.8, Parent and
Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.



 

34 4.9 _Company Stock_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) neither Parent
nor Merger Sub is, and at no time during the last three years have either of
them been, an "acquiring person" with respect to the Company as defined in
Section 23B.19.020 of Washington Law, and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub
owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) or is a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the
Company (other than as contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting

Section 6.3(a), in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited, bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Companys Board
of Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice
of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 6.3(g)(ii)), the
Company may then take the following actions (but only if and to the extent
that the Board of Directors of the Company, by vote of a majority of the
members of the Companys Board of Directors, concludes in good faith,
following the receipt of advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that
such action is necessary and required to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law):

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that (a) (1) concurrently with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such party, the Company gives Parent written notice
of its intention to furnish such nonpublic information and (2) the Company
receives from the third party an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such third party on the
Companys behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (b) contemporaneously with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, the Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished); and

Acquisition Proposal,  _provided_ that concurrently with entering into
negotiations with such third party, the Company gives Parent written notice of
the Companys intention to enter into negotiations with such third party.

(d) _Termination; Change of Recommendation_. In response to the receipt of a
Superior Offer: (A) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f)(ii), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence or Section
8.1(f)(ii),  



 

40  and any purported termination pursuant to this sentence or Section
8.1(f)(ii) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently
with such termination in accordance with this Section 6.3(d) the Company pays
to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i); and/or
(B) the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify its recommendation in favor of the Merger, and, in the case of a
Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to the
stockholders of the Company, may recommend that the stockholders of the
Company accept the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions,
whether by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, a
"Change of Recommendation"), if, with respect to both (A) and (B) above, all
of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (vi) are met and with
respect to clause (A) only the condition in clause (vii) shall have been met:

(i) A Superior Offer with respect to the Company has been made and has not
been withdrawn;

(ii) The Stockholders Meeting has not occurred;

(iii) The Company shall have (a) delivered to Parent written notice at least
three Business Days prior to exercising its right to terminate this Agreement
or effecting such Change of Recommendation (a "Section 6.3(d) Notice") which

the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of
the Person or group making the Superior Offer, and (3) that the Company
intends to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal and the
manner in which it intends to do so, (b) provided to Parent a copy of all
written materials delivered to the Person or group making the Superior Offer
in connection with such Superior Offer and a summary of all material
oral conversations between the Company and such party regarding the Superior
Offer, and (c) made available to Parent all materials and information made
available to the Person or group making the Superior Offer in connection with
such Superior Offer;

(iv) After delivering the Section 6.3(d) Notice, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement during such three Business Day period, and
negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such three Business Day
period, as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to
stockholders in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger without making a Change of Recommendation;

(v) The Board of Directors of the Company (by a vote of a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company) has concluded in good faith,
after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Offer and after considering any adjustments or negotiations pursuant
to the preceding clause (iv), terminating this Agreement to accept such

things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and
the Person making the offer, including without limitation any proposed
conditions to consummation, to be more favorable, from a financial point of
view, to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders)

determined by the Board of Directors to be available by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

6.6 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use all reasonable
efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action that
would impede compliance with, all Legal Requirements, and as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements,

and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i)

of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other national, provincial,
and state (U.S. and non-U.S.) statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or impeding or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition, in any case that are applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the
Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity under this Section 6.6(a) to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) _Exchange of Information_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each
shall promptly supply the other with any information that may be required in
order to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to  



 

43  Section 6.6(a). Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements,
and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
shall (i) consult with the other prior to taking a position with respect to
any such filing, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the
foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including under any
antitrust or fair trade Legal Requirement), (iii) coordinate with the other in
preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other
and/or its counsel with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions
(and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ that with respect to any such
filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent and the Company need not
supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in the case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such
party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information (iv) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences with
Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be agreed in
connection with any joint defense agreement executed between counsel for
Parent and counsel for the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
not be required to share with each other any documents covered by Item 4(c) of
filings prepared in connection with the HSR Act.

(c) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of
any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto,
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements and (iii) any
written communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party seeking to enjoin the Merger under any Antitrust Law. Whenever
any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 6.6(a), Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of
such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental
Entity such amendment or supplement.

(d)  _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of Section
6.2 and Section 6.3 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using all reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit,
claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii)
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement

execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar
Legal  



 

44  Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(e) _Limitation on Divestiture_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.6(a) through (d), if any
objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or otherwise brought
under any Antitrust Law that would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to
resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could
reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, effecting an Action of
Divestiture; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be required to take
any Action of Divestiture that would reasonably be likely to adversely and
materially impact Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the benefits Parent expects to
derive from the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Company shall not take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture that
would reasonably be likely to adversely and materially impact Parent and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or the benefits Parent expects to derive from the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall
mean (i) any license, sale or other disposition or holding separate (through
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any shares of capital stock or of
any business, assets or properties of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates
or of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the imposition of any limitation
on the ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company or its
Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock
or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their
respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the imposition of any impediment on
Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries
under any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, order or other
legal restraint governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade
practices.

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) _By the Company_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and
Merger Sub of (1) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section
7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied or (2) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced by any Person (including a
Governmental Entity) that seek to prohibit or materially impair
the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.

(b) _By Parent_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any
failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section
7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied or (2) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced by any Person (including a
Governmental Entity) that seek to prohibit or materially impair the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.

6.8 _Third-Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any material
consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries  



 

45  respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including all consents,
waivers and approvals set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any material consents, waivers, and
approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries respective contracts required
to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby, including all consents, waivers and approvals set forth
in Section 4.3(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. In connection with seeking
such consents, waivers and approvals, the Company and Parent shall keep each
other informed of all material developments and, each shall at the request of
the other, include the other in any discussions or communications with any
parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought hereunder. The Companys
consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form acceptable to Parent and
Parents consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form acceptable to the
Company. In the event the Merger does not close for any reason, neither shall
have any liability to the other, its stockholders or any other Person for any
costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company or Parent
seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals.

6.9 _Equity Awards and Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Assumption of Employee Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding Company Option other than Non-Employee Options, whether or not
exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the respective exercise
prices thereof, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option other than Non-
Employee Options so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Company Option (including any applicable stock option agreement or
other document evidencing such Company Option) immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions),
except that (i) each such Company Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a fraction equal to (A)
$12.25 divided by (B) the average of the closing prices for a share of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten (10) trading days
ended one trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (such fraction,
the "Option Ratio,") rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent. Each assumed Company Option shall be vested
immediately following the Effective Time as to the same percentage of the
total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested as to immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such Company Option by its
terms in effect prior to the date hereof provides for acceleration of vesting
upon the Effective Time. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent will use
all reasonable efforts to issue to each Person who holds an assumed Company
Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option
by Parent and, as a condition to such assumption, each former holder of a
Company Option so assumed by Parent shall acknowledge the receipt of the same
in exchange for such holders Company Option. If and to the extent necessary
or required by the terms of the 1997 Stock Option Plan of Pathlight
Technology, Inc. or any Company Option issued thereunder, the Company shall,
prior to the Effective Time, receive consent of the holders of such Company
Options, provide notice to the holders of such Company Options and/or amend
the terms of such plan, to give effect to the provisions of this Section
6.9(a).

(b) _Assumption of Rocksoft Retention Stock Awards_. The parties will
negotiate in good faith and use reasonable best efforts to agree on a plan,
agreement or other arrangement pursuant to which at the Effective Time,
Parent will assume the obligation of the Company to create a retention pool
for specific employees of Rocksoft Limited (the "Rocksoft Retention Pool")
pursuant to the terms of the Implementation Agreement entered into between
the Company and Rocksoft Limited and Ross Neil Williams and Neil James Johnson
that satisfies the following conditions: (i) shares of Company Common Stock
will not be required to be issued to such employees, (ii) Parent shall not,
under any circumstances, be obligated to issue a number of  



 

46  shares such that, pursuant to the rules and regulations of The New York
Stock Exchange, it would be required to obtain approval of its shareholders
for such issuance and (iii) Parent, as of the closing of the Implementation
Agreement, shall not be obligated to pay, set aside or otherwise allocate, in
excess of $2,000,000, in the aggregate, to such employees to satisfy the
Companys obligations with respect to the Rocksoft Retention Pool.

(c) _Incentive Stock Options_. The conversion of Company Options provided for
in Section 6.9(a), with respect to any options which are intended to be
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

(d) _Termination of Company Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company Purchase Plans shall be terminated. The
rights of participants in each Company Purchase Plan with respect to any
offering period then underway under such Company Purchase Plan shall be
determined by treating the last Business Day prior to, or if more
administratively advisable, the last payroll date of the Company immediately
prior to, the Effective Time, as the last day of such offering period and by
making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering
period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
under such Company Purchase Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of such
the Company Purchase Plan) that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 6.9(d).

(e) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans that include a
Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be
terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that the 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated
(effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or the
relevant Subsidiary, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to Parents prior approval, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Company also shall take such other actions
in furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably
require.

(f) _Employee Benefits_. As of and following the Closing Date, Parent, in its
sole and absolute discretion, will either (i) continue any Company Employee
Plans, (ii) permit employees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries who
continue employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any or their
subsidiaries) following the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees"), and, as
applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in (1) the employee
welfare and fringe benefit plans, programs and policies (including without
limitation any vacation, sick, and personal time off plans or programs) of
Parent and (2) any plans of Parent intended to qualify within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code, on terms no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i)
and (ii); _provided_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to
prevent Parent from requiring that the Company terminate its 401(k) plan
pursuant to Section 6.9(d), so long as Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate in Parents 401(k) plan as soon as reasonably practicable (but, in
any event, no later than 90-days) following the Closing Date, pursuant to the
terms of the Parents 401(k) plan. To the extent Parent elects to have
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate in any of its
employee benefits plans, programs or policies (other than stock compensation
plans or arrangements) following the Closing Date, (i) each such Continuing
Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and benefit accrual under such plan (other than benefit accrual under
any defined benefit plan) for all years of service with Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) Parent will cause any
and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any welfare benefit plans,
including, without limitation, group health plans, group disability plans and
group-term life insurance plans, of Parent in which such employees and their
eligible dependents become eligible to participate to be waived and will
provide credit for any  



 

47  co-payments and deductibles prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such plans that may apply after the Closing Date. Without limiting
the generality of Section 9.5, or any specific applicability thereof, with
respect to the legal enforceability of the foregoing, this Section 6.9(f)
is intended to be for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
this Section 6.9(f) is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

6.10 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options, to the
extent Form S-8 is available promptly after the Effective Time, and shall use
all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Company
Options assumed in accordance with this Agreement remain outstanding.

6.11 _Employee Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
provide to Parent a current schedule in the form maintained by the Companys
human resources or stock administration department for internal record keeping
purposes that identifies as of the Effective Time with respect to each holder
of Company Options and Company Unvested Common Stock with reasonable accuracy
and detail, (i) the name of the holder, (ii) the total number of shares
subject to such award, (iii) the Company Stock Option Plan under which such
award was issued, (iv) the exercise (or purchase price of such award,
if applicable), (v) the extent to which such award is vested as the Effective
Time, (vi) the vesting schedule of such award, (vii) the grant date of such
award, and (viii) the expiration date of such award.

6.12 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnity_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall be deemed to have (and
hereby will have) assumed and agreed to perform in all respects, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) the obligations of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the indemnification
agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement between the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company and each present (as at the Effective Time) and
former officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") and listed on Schedule 2 hereto and
(ii) for a period of six years from the Effective Time and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, the obligation of the Company to
indemnify the Indemnified Parties in accordance with the terms of the Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to use all reasonable efforts to cause
to be maintained directors and officers liability insurance from (i) the
Companys insurance carrier on the date of this Agreement, (ii) from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, or (iii) Parents insurance carrier on the date of
this Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability insurance,
covering those persons who are covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof for events
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as those in the current directors and officers insurance policy
of the Company for a period of six years; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event will Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
excess of the amount set forth in Schedule 6.12(b) in annual premium for such
coverage (and to the extent the annual premium would exceed the amount set
forth in Schedule 6.12(b) in annual premium for such coverage, the Surviving
Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained, for
such amount set forth in Schedule 6.12(b) of annual premium (1) the maximum
amount of coverage as is available and (2) coverage that is in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as that in the then current directors and

, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy its and the Surviving
Corporations obligations under this Section 6.12(b) by purchasing a "tail"

policy by the Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) (x)
under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy or
otherwise from Parents insurance carrier on the date  



 

48  hereof, or (y) from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance, which, in either case, (a) has an effective

policy as of the date hereof or purchases, or consents to the purchase by the
Company of a "tail" policy pursuant to this Section 6.12(b), there shall be no
period in time during which an insurance policy providing coverage in the
amount and scope provided in this Section 6.12(b) for the persons who are
intended to be covered by such directors and officers liability insurance
policy under this Section 6.12(b) is not in effect.

(c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 6.12 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In the

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 6.12.

6.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including

individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.14 _Affiliates_. Promptly following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all known Persons who

Company shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain a written agreement from
each such identified Person who makes a Stock Election, as soon as
practicable and, in any event, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Election Deadline, substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto.

6.15 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

6.16  _Insurance Approval_. The Company shall deliver to Parent at least 15
days prior to the Closing a letter in a form acceptable to Parent validly
executed by an officer of the Company, which authorizes Parents insurance
broker to act as the Companys insurance broker of record with respect to all
insurance policies held by the Company.

6.17 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger and
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of
options to purchase Parent Common Stock to be approved for listing on The New
York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

6.18 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments and to
satisfy the conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth therein, (ii)
enter into  



 

49  definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing as
contemplated by the Financing Commitments (the "Financing Agreements"),
so that the Financing Agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable but
in any event no later than the Closing Date and (iii) consummate the Financing
at or prior to Closing. Parent shall provide to the Company copies of all
final documents relating to the Financing and shall keep the Company informed
of the status of the financing process relating thereto. The Company shall,
and shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries to, provide such cooperation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing;
_provided_ that, the Company shall not be required to provide any such
assistance which would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs incurred by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
such cooperation.

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to
satisfy its obligations under Section 6.18(a), any of the Financing
Commitments or the Financing Agreements expire or are terminated prior to the
Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent shall (i) promptly notify
the Company of such expiration or termination and the reasons therefor and
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to arrange for alternative debt
financing (upon terms and conditions substantially comparable to those
contained in such expired or terminated commitments or agreements, except
with respect to economic terms and conditions, which shall be no less
favorable than those contained in such expired or terminated commitments or
agreements) to replace the financing contemplated by such expired or
terminated commitments or agreements in an amount sufficient to permit Parent
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.19  _Retention Plan_. Parent and the Company agree to work together in good
faith to design and develop a cash compensation program to be adopted by the
Company for the purpose of retaining employees of the Company through and
following the Effective Time not to exceed $5,000,000 (the "Retention Plan").
Parent and the Company shall each take into account the reasonable input of
the other in designing, developing and selecting the employees eligible to
participate in the Retention Plan, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Retention Plan to be duly adopted, implemented and
communicated to employees of the Company as soon as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, by May 31, 2006, if possible. Parent agrees to assume the
Retention Plan after the Closing and to not terminate, amend or otherwise
modify the Retention Plan, and to make all payments provided for in the
Retention Plan following the Effective Time, as such payments become due and
payable, subject to the terms of the Retention Plan. Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.5, or any specific applicability thereof, with respect
to the legal enforceability of the foregoing, this Section 6.19 is intended
to be for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and this Section
6.19 is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder.

Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation,  



 

54  dissolution or similar transaction involving the party pursuant to which the
equity interests held in such party and retained following such transaction

transaction or any direct or indirect parent thereof, (ii) a sale or other
disposition by the party of assets representing in excess of 40% of the

the stockholders of the Company, _provided_ , after approval of the Merger by
the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which by law or in
accordance with the rules of Nasdaq requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time either party
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the performance of

trading volume in such stock; _provided_ that this clause (C) shall not
exclude any underlying Effect which may have caused such change in stock price
or trading volume, (D) primarily resulting from acts of terrorism or war which
changes do not disproportionately affect such entity taken as a whole with
its Subsidiaries, (E) primarily resulting from suspension or delay of customer
orders, the threat of suspension of future customer orders, a slowdown in the
rate of new orders from existing channels or the suspension of supplier
relationships, in each case, resulting from the announcement of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, (F) primarily resulting from a
failure to meet securities analysts published revenue or earnings
predictions for the Company for any period ending (or for which revenues or
earnings are released) on or after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that
this clause (F) shall not exclude the revenues or earnings of the Company
themselves or any Effect which may have affected the Companys revenues or
earnings, (G) primarily resulting from changes in GAAP first publicly
disclosed after the date hereof, or (H) primarily resulting from any Action
of Divestiture that would not reasonably be likely to adversely and materially
impact Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the benefits Parent expects to derive from
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii)
materially impede the authority of such entity, or, in any case, Parent, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with
the terms hereof and applicable Legal Requirements.

any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation), general
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint
venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability company or
joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association, organization,
entity or Governmental Entity.

9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Voting Agreements and other Exhibits hereto (i) constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the
Effective Time, in Section 6.12.



 

57 9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

9.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached.

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction
and venue of federal and state courts in the State of Washington, the State
of California and the State of Delaware in connection with any matter based
upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein,
agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the
laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to
assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such
jurisdiction, venue and such process.

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

9.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties, except that Parent may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains
ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Section 9.10 shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
