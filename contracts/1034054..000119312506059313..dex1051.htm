after such submission, determine and report to Seller and Buyer upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and

Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed
by each such party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm)
bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. In
acting under this Agreement, Sellers Independent Accountants, Buyers
Independent Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled
to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

(c) The Final Statement of Working Capital shall be deemed final for the
purposes of this Section 2.4 upon the earliest of (A) the failure of Buyer to
deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller within thirty-five (35) Business Days of
the Final Adjustment Date, and (B) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
Section 2.4(b). Within three (3) Business Days of the Final Statement of
Working Capital being deemed final, a Purchase Price adjustment shall be made
as follows:

(i) in the event that the Reference Working Capital exceeds the Final Working
Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal
to such excess, and Seller shall, within three (3) Business Days of
such determination, pay such amount (or the applicable portion thereof not
then subject to any dispute pursuant to Section 2.4(b)) to Buyer in Escrow
Shares (valued at the SBA Average Closing Price) and/or cash and shall
authorize the Escrow Agent to act accordingly; and

(ii) in the event that the Final Working Capital exceeds the Reference Working
Capital, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal
to such excess, and Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days of such
determination, pay such excess (or the applicable portion thereof not then
subject to any dispute pursuant to Section 2.4(b)) to Seller by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller in writing.

agrees that it will not offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or
contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of,

the provisions of Section 5.13 of this Agreement or in an Approved Block
Trade. Seller may not effect more than two Marketed Secondary Offerings in any
365 day period.

(b) To the extent that Buyer exercises its option to substitute cash for
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b), the number of
Restricted Shares shall be reduced by an amount equal to 54% of the shares of
Stock Consideration substituted with cash; provided further that if the number
of shares of Stock Consideration substituted with cash exceeds 7,600,000
shares of Parent Common Stock, then the restrictions imposed by Section 2.5(a)

Restricted Shares to (A) a member of Seller (each a " _Seller Member_ ") in
the course of Seller distribution to such Seller Member or (B) an entity
controlled by Seller, and a Seller Member may transfer any portion of the
Stock Consideration to a member, partner, limited partner or shareholder of
such Seller Member (each such member, partner, limited partner or shareholder
(and each subsequent member, partner, limited partner or shareholder that is a
distributee) shall also be deemed a "Seller Member" for purposes hereof) in
the course of such Seller Members distribution, in each case, in accordance
with the Securities Act.

resale of the Restricted Shares will be subject to certain restrictions and
that the Restricted Shares may only be transferred in accordance with Section
2.5 above. Each certificate issued pursuant to this Agreement representing the

(by public filing with the SEC or otherwise) true and complete copies of all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and any definitive proxy or information
statements required to be filed by Parent pursuant to the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2003 (the " _SEC Filings_ "), each of which has complied in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as in effect on the date so filed, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC Filing
filed or furnished to the SEC by Parent and in either case, publicly
available prior to the date hereof. None of the SEC Filings (including, any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein) contained when filed, and any SEC Filings filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof will not contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent SEC Filing.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent SEC Filing, all of the financial statements included in the SEC
Filings, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with the
SEC (those filed with the SEC are collectively referred to as the " _Parent
Financial Statements_ "), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments which
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect). The consolidated balance sheets (including
the related notes) included in such Parent Financial Statements (if
applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent SEC
Filing) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such
Parent Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent SEC Filing) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries for the
periods indicated, subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, year-end audit adjustments which could not reasonably be expected to
be material, individually or in the aggregate.

(c) Parent has designed and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.



 

35 (d) The management of Parent has (i) implemented disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Parent, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent by others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act), to Parents
outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of Parent
(A) all significant deficiencies and material weakness in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and
whether or not contingent or absolute, that are material to Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) liabilities or
obligations disclosed or provided for in the consolidated balance sheet of
Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, including
the notes thereto, contained in the SEC Filings, (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred on behalf of Buyer in connection with this Agreement,
(iii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since January 1, 2006, and (iv) other
liabilities or obligations that are not otherwise covered by insurance that
were not, or could not reasonably be expected to be, material and adverse to
the businesses of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 4.15  _Status under the Securities Act_. At the time of filing the
Registration Statement, the Parent (i) will be a "well-known seasoned issuer"
(as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) and (ii) will not be
an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act), in
each case at the times relevant under the Securities Act in connection with
the offering of the Stock Consideration.

Section 4.16 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since January 1, 2006, Parent has conducted its business only
in the ordinary course in all material respects and in a manner consistent
with prior practice in all material respects and there has not been any event
or occurrence of any condition that has had or could reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Company Common Stock or other capital stock of Company to any person pursuant
to or in settlement of Company Options after the Closing. Company shall
withhold from any payments made to any optionholder in settlement of Company
Options any and all Taxes or other amounts required by Law to be withheld. 

Section 5.10 _Employees_.

(a) Seller shall provide each Covered Employee whose employment with Company
is terminated by Buyer on the Closing Date following the Closing (other than
for "cause", as defined in Section 5.10(f) below), with severance pay and
benefits, as applicable, in accordance with Companys severance plan
identified in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedules. No later than twenty-
five (25) days following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall inform
Seller in writing of the name of any Covered Employee whose employment with
Company Buyer intends to terminate on the Closing Date.

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first year
anniversary of the Closing, Buyer shall or shall cause Company to maintain in
effect compensation to the Covered Employees that remain employed by Company
following the Closing Date which is substantially similar to the compensation
provided by Company as in effect on the date hereof to such Covered Employees.

(c) Following the Closing, each Covered Employee that remains employed by
Company shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans maintained
by Parent or its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of such plans and
providing benefits no less favorable than to other similarly situated
employees of Parent or Buyer. For purposes of determining eligibility to
participate in, and non-forfeitable rights under, any employee benefit plan
or arrangement of Buyer or, following Closing, Company, Covered Employees who
remain employed by Company following the Closing Date shall receive service
credit for service with Company and any Company Subsidiary (and with any
predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for Company or any
Company Subsidiary granted service credit) as if such service had been
completed with Buyer.



 

43 (d) Buyer shall or following Closing shall cause Company to waive or cause its
insurance carriers to waive any pre-existing condition limitation on
participation and coverage applicable to any Covered Employee who remains
employed by Company following the Closing or any of his or her covered
dependents under any Buyer or Company health or welfare plan (a " _New Plan_
") in which such Covered Employee or covered dependent shall become eligible
to participate after the Closing to the extent such Covered Employee or
covered dependent was no longer subject to such pre-existing condition
limitation under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee or such covered dependent was participating immediately before he or
she became eligible to participate in the New Plan. Buyer shall or following
Closing shall cause Company to provide each Covered Employee who remains
employed by Company following the Closing Date with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing and during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs under any Company Benefit Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for such calendar year under
any New Plan in which such Covered Employee participates after the Closing.

(e) Buyer shall or following Closing shall cause Company to recognize any
unused paid time off and sick leave hours available to each Covered Employee
as of the Closing under Companys paid time off policy applicable to such
Covered Employee, up to the amount of accrued liability included in the
Companys Final Balance Sheet, and to recognize service by each
Covered Employee with Company for purposes of determining eligibility for
vacation and sick leave following the Closing under the applicable vacation
and sick leave policies of Buyer or Company.

(f) Following Closing, if Buyer terminates the employment with Company of any
Covered Employee, or Buyer otherwise fails to adhere to the employment
requirements and policies set forth in Companys severance plan identified in
Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any such Covered
Employee, in each case, within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
Buyer or Company shall provide each such Covered Employee with severance pay
and benefits, as applicable, in accordance with Companys severance plan
identified in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedules, subject only
to Buyers right to terminate any such employment for Cause (as defined
herein). Termination for "Cause" shall mean termination of an employee from
employment with Buyer for any of the following reasons: (i) the
employees willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties and
responsibilities to Buyer or deliberate violation of a material policy of
Buyer; (ii) the employees commission of any material act or acts of fraud,
embezzlement, dishonesty, or other willful misconduct; (iii) the employees
material unauthorized use or disclosure of any proprietary information or
trade secrets of Buyer or any other party to whom the employee owes an
obligation of nondisclosure as a result of his or her relationship with
Buyer; or (iv) employees willful and material breach of any of his or her
obligations under any written agreement or covenant with Buyer.

(g) Without limiting the scope of Section 8.1, nothing in this Section 5.10
shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any
Covered Employee or any other person other than Seller, Company and Buyer and
their respective successors and assigns.



 

44 (h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, on or before the Closing,
Company may in its sole discretion terminate any Company Pension Plan
provided that the termination is not reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.

(i) With respect to any "MandA qualified beneficiary" within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. § 4980B-9 QandA 4, continuation coverage under COBRA shall be
furnished under a Buyer group health plan. In the event of any corporate
reorganization of Buyer prior to Buyers fulfillment of its obligations under
COBRA to any MandA qualified beneficiaries hereunder, Buyer shall require, as a
condition of any such transaction, that the transferee(s) of any stock or
assets assume and fulfill the remaining COBRA obligations to MandA qualified
beneficiaries.

(j) Buyer shall not, at any time prior to one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date, effectuate a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as those
terms are defined under the WARN Act, or any similar state Law, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, affecting in whole or in part any
facility, site of employment, operating unit or employee of Company and any
Company Subsidiary without complying fully with the requirements of the WARN
Act or such applicable state Law.

Section 5.11 _Transitional Facilities_. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Cequel III, LLC to provide Buyer and Company
sufficient space and facilities at Companys current corporate headquarters
located in St. Louis, Missouri for twenty (20) employees for a period of
three (3) months from the Closing Date, at no cost to Company or Buyer.

Section 5.12 _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement_. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, an "automatic shelf registration
statement" as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act on Form S-3
registering the sale of Parent Common Stock, among other securities, will have
been filed by Parent with the SEC which shall, among other things, permit the
resale of the Stock Consideration by Seller (and any transferees
or distributees of Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(c)). As of the
Closing, such registration statement, and any post-effective amendment
thereto, if any, shall have become effective on filing and no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any part
thereof will have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or under
Section 8A of the Securities Act will have been initiated or threatened by the
SEC, and no notice of objection of the SEC to the use of such registration
statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2)
under the Act will have been received by the Parent. The registration
statement, any post-effective amendment thereto, the base prospectus and any
prospectus supplement relating to the Stock Consideration filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (including but not
limited to, the Prospectus Supplement), each as amended at the time such part
of the registration statement becomes effective, together with the exhibits
thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " _Registration Statement_." Upon filing, the
Registration Statement conformed and, will conform, in all material respects
to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, except during any suspension permitted by Section 5.13.
The Registration Statement will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and the prospectus
contained therein (which shall, if applicable, include the base  



 

45  prospectus included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
Supplement, in each case as they may be amended or supplemented from time to
time) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made therein, not misleading;
provided, that no representation or warranty is made as to information
contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, or the base
prospectus or any prospectus supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information relating to Seller furnished to Parent by Seller or
any representatives on behalf of Seller (or any transferees or distributees of
Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) expressly for use in the
Registration Statement, prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to the
Stock Consideration.

Section 5.13 _Prospectus Supplement; Effectiveness of Registration Statement;
Marketed Secondary Offering_. 

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to Seller (or any transferee or
distributees pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) a form of final Prospectus
Supplement (in such quantities as it or they may reasonably request) relating
to the resale of the Stock Consideration by Seller (and any transferees or
distributees of Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(c)), together
with a Prospectus to be filed with the SEC in accordance with Rule 424(b)
under the Securities Act (the " _Prospectus Supplement_ "), and no later than
the SECs close of business on the second Business Day following the Closing
shall file the Prospectus Supplement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)
under the Securities Act. Parent further agrees to file promptly with the SEC
any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus Supplement that may, in the
judgment of Parent, be required by the Securities Act or requested by the
SEC. Parent agrees to advise Seller, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Prospectus Supplement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is filed and to promptly deliver such number of Prospectus
Supplements or any amendments or supplements thereto as Seller (and any
transferees or distributees of Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5(c))
may request.

(b) Parent covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Registration Statement continuously effective for the lesser of (i) two years
(plus the amount of time that the Registration Statement or Prospectus
Supplement may not be used or are not available from time to time to effect
resales of any Stock Consideration hereunder) (the " _Minimum Effective
Period_ ") or (ii) until such earlier date as of which all the Stock
Consideration shall have been disposed of in the manner described in the
Registration Statement. Parent may suspend the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and the use of any Prospectus included therein in the
event, and for such period of time as (i) such a suspension is required by the
rules and regulations of the SEC as applied to Parent, (ii) such Prospectus
ceases to meet the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act or (iii)
in the good faith determination by Parents board of directors, offers and
sales pursuant to the Registration Statement should not be made by reason of
the existence of material undisclosed circumstances or developments with
respect to which the disclosure that would be required in the Registration
Statement would be premature and would have an adverse effect on Parent.
Parent will immediately advise Seller of any such suspension, and will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such suspension to terminate at
the earliest possible date and no such suspension shall exceed sixty (60) days
in any one case, and shall not exceed ninety (90) days in any twelve (12)
month period (together with any and all other delays permitted in this Section
5.13). Seller agrees that following receipt  



 

46  of any such notice, and until such suspension is terminated, Seller will not
make use of the suspended Prospectus Supplement and will make no sales
requiring delivery of such prospectus. Parent also agrees to notify Seller
immediately of the happening of any event as a result of which (1) the
Registration Statement, as then in effect, would contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (2) the
prospectus (which shall include the base prospectus included in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, in each case as they
may be amended or supplemented from time to time) would contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly update and/or correct such
Registration Statement and/or prospectus, as the case may be.

(c) If at the time of any post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement, including by way of a Section 10(a)(3) amendment, Parent is not a
"well-known seasoned issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)
or is an "ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act), or is otherwise not permitted to utilize an automatic shelf
registration statement under the Securities Act, Parent will file a
registration statement on Form S-3, or any other appropriate form, registering
the resale of the Stock Consideration and the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Section 5.13 regarding the Registration Statement
and the prospectus shall apply to such new registration statement and
prospectus.

(d) Parent shall take all actions set forth in this Section 5.13 to permit
Seller to sell in Marketed Secondary Offerings. Upon notice from Seller of its
intent to sell Restricted Shares through a Marketed Secondary Offering,
Parent shall promptly prepare and file a prospectus supplement to the
Registration Statement; provided, however, Seller hereby acknowledges that
there may occasionally be times when Parent may be required by the
federal securities laws to delay any offering of its securities, including
the Marketed Secondary Offering, if in the good faith determination by the
board of directors of Parent offers and sales pursuant to the Registration
Statement should not be made by reason of the existence of material
undisclosed circumstances or developments with respect to which the disclosure
that would be required in the Registration Statement would be premature and
would have an adverse effect on Parent; provided further, however, any such
delay shall not exceed sixty (60) days in any one case, and shall not exceed
ninety (90) days in any twelve (12) month period (together with any and all
other delays permitted in this Section 5.13).

 

(e) Seller, if proposing to resell any Restricted Shares through a Marketed
Secondary Offering or Approved Block Sale, to the extent applicable, shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form. In connection with a
Marketed Secondary Offering and, to the extent customary, an Approved Block
Trade, Parent shall enter into such customary agreements
(including underwriting agreements in customary form that includes, among
other things, customary representations and warranties and indemnities for the
benefit of Seller and the underwriters) and take all such other actions
(including, without limitation, causing the Chief Executive Officer or the
Chief Financial Officer to participate in any "road show" or "road shows") as
the underwriters reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Restricted Shares. In any such Marketed Secondary
Offering of any Restricted Shares,  



 

47  Seller shall have the right to select one or more manager(s) from the list
of the Approved Underwriters to administer the offering and join any
underwriting group.

(f) Parent has the right to delay any Marketed Secondary Offering to the
extent it intends to conduct a primary offering of Parent Common Stock within
sixty (60) days of the proposed Marketed Secondary Offering. Parent shall send
to Seller written notice of its intent to conduct a primary offering and, if
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the receipt of such notice, Seller
shall so request in writing, Parent shall include in such offering all or any
part of the Restricted Shares owned by Seller requested to be included, except
that if, in connection with any underwritten public offering for the account
of Parent the managing underwriter(s) thereof shall impose a limitation on the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock which may be included because, in such
underwriter(s) judgment, marketing or other factors dictate such limitation
is necessary to facilitate public distribution, then Parent shall be obligated
to include only such limited portion of the Restricted Shares with respect to
which Seller has requested inclusion hereunder as the underwriter shall
permit. 

(g) If Seller intends to sell Restricted Shares through a Marketed Secondary
Offering, Seller shall agree to (i) sell such Restricted Shares on the terms
provided in a customary underwriting agreement and (ii) complete and execute
all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements
and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting agreement
or reasonably requested by Parent; provided that no representations or
warranties will be required to be made to Parent or the underwriters (other
than representations and warranties regarding Sellers intended method
of distribution).

(h) In the case of a Marketed Secondary Offering, other than the sales
discount, which shall be for the account of Seller, Parent and Seller shall
split equally all other costs associated with such sales (including, but not
limited to, registration fees, reasonable attorney fees of Parent and Seller,
printing expenses associated with the preparation and distribution of the
requested prospectuses); provided, however, Parent shall not be responsible
for any incremental costs associated with the inclusion of any unrestricted
shares of Stock Consideration in any Marketed Secondary Offering. 

(i) Parent shall file as and when applicable, on a timely basis, all reports
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act. If Parent is not required
to file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, upon the request of Seller,
Parent shall make publicly available the information specified in subparagraph
(c)(2) of Rule 144. Parent shall take such further action as may be
reasonably required from time to time and as may be within the reasonable
control of Parent, to enable the holders of Restricted Shares to transfer the
Restricted Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 or any similar rule or
regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of Seller, Parent
will deliver to Seller such a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof. In connection with
any sale, transfer or other disposition by a holder of shares of Stock
Consideration of any shares of Stock Consideration pursuant to Rule 144,
Parent shall cooperate with such holder to facilitate the timely preparation
and delivery of certificates representing shares of Stock Consideration to be
sold and not bearing any Securities Act legend, and enable certificates for
such shares of Stock Consideration to be for such number of shares and
registered in such names as the holder may reasonably request at least two
Business Days prior to any sale of any shares of Stock Consideration.



 

48 (j) Unless Parent shall have waived in writing the resale restrictions set
forth in Section 2.5, Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, (x) enter
into any merger, consolidation or reorganization in which Parent shall not be
the surviving corporation or (y) transfer or agree to transfer all or
substantially all of Parents assets, unless prior to such merger,
consolidation, reorganization or asset transfer, the surviving corporation or
the transferee, respectively, shall have agreed in writing to assume the
obligations of Parent under this Agreement, and for that purpose references
hereunder to "Stock Consideration" shall be deemed to include the securities
which the holders of Stock Consideration would be entitled to receive pursuant
to any such merger, consolidation or reorganization. 

(k) Parent shall obtain so-called "comfort letters" from Parents independent
public accountants, and legal opinions of counsel to Parent addressed to
underwriters and Seller, in customary form and covering such matters of the
type customarily covered by such letters, and in a form that shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the underwriters. Parent shall furnish to Seller a
signed counterpart of any such comfort letter or legal opinion. Delivery of
any such opinion or comfort letter shall be subject to the recipient
furnishing such written representations or acknowledgements as are
customarily provided by selling shareholders who receive such comfort letters
or opinions.

(l) Parent shall take such other actions as are reasonably required and
customary in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Restricted
Shares included in the Registration Statement, the Marketed Secondary Offering
or Approved Block Sale.

(m) Parent shall notify Seller of any stop order issued or threatened to be
issued by the SEC in connection with the Registration Statement and take all
reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order or to
remove it if entered.

(n) Parent shall make available for inspection by Seller and to any
underwriter participating in a Marketed Secondary Offering or an Approved
Block Sale, and to each of their representatives, all financial and other
information as shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide Seller, any
participating underwriter and their respective representatives the opportunity
to discuss the business affairs of Parent with its principal executives and
independent public accountants who have certified the audited financial
statements included in the Registration Statement in each case as necessary to
enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility under the
Securities Act; provided, however, that the information that Parent
determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which Parent advises such
person in writing is confidential shall not be disclosed unless such person
signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to Parent or Seller
agrees to be responsible for such persons breach of confidentiality on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(o) Seller (and any transferees or distributees pursuant to Section 2.5(c)
may include any shares of Stock Consideration that do not constitute
Restricted Shares in a Marketed Secondary Offering or an Approved Block Trade.

of this Agreement with respect to such representations and warranties, shall
survive the Closing and shall expire at 11:59 p.m. ET on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "). 

(b) All of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the parties contained
in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or any other document,
certificate, schedule or instrument delivered or executed in connection
herewith shall survive (i) until fully performed or fulfilled, unless non-
compliance with such covenants, agreements or obligations is waived
in writing by the party or parties entitled to such performance or (ii) if

of limitations. Each party shall have the right to fully rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other parties
contained in this Agreement or in any other documents or certificates
delivered at Closing, other than breaches of which Buyer has actual Knowledge
at Closing, of which Seller had no previous Knowledge and which Buyer has
advised Seller prior to Closing. Each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement of the parties contained in this Agreement is independent of each
other representation, warranty, covenant and agreement.

(d) If, at any time prior to the expiration of any of the representations and
warranties, as provided in Section 7.1(a), any Indemnified Party delivers to
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, a written notice made in good faith
alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by Company, Seller, Parent or Buyer (and
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such Indemnified Partys
belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a claim for
damages under Section 7.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then
the representation or warranty underlying the  



 

52  claim asserted in such notice and all indemnity obligations under this
Article VII related thereto shall survive and the Escrow Period shall be
extended, in each case, solely with respect to such claim and until such time
as such claim is fully and finally resolved in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

(e) For purposes of determining the amount of Escrow Shares that shall be
released to Buyer in settlement of any claims, each Escrow Share shall be
valued at the SBA Average Closing Price.

Section 7.2 _Indemnification Obligations_.

Agreement, to indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates and the officers, directors,
employees, agents, advisers and representatives of each such

harmless from and after the Closing Date for any and all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by Buyer Indemnitees, (i) arising out of or resulting
from the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller or Company, other
than a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 3.7(c) and
3.22(b), (ii) arising out of or resulting from the breach of any covenant or
agreement of Seller, in each case, contained in this Agreement, except, in

Buyer and Seller agree that, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, for (i) any breach of any representation and warranty in Section
3.7(c), Losses for such breach will be calculated as the amount by which
Companys actual monthly tower cash flow (which shall include the aggregate
net impact of all inadvertent excluded or included site leasing revenues or
expenses), as of February 1, 2006 based on Companys books and records
(calculated in the same manner as Company calculated tower cash flow for
purposes of preparing the schedule in Section 3.7(c)) was less than the tower
cash flow on February 1, 2006 set forth on the schedule annualized and the
result multiplied by the Indemnity Multiple and (ii) any breach of any
representation and warranty in Section 3.22(b), Losses for such breach will be
calculated as the annualized rent as of February 1, 2006 (net of any revenue
sharing directly related to any such Tenant Lease) payable under any Tenant
Lease omitted from Schedule 3.22(b) in breach thereof multiplied by the
Indemnity Multiple.

(c) Each of Buyer and Parent agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement, to indemnify Seller, its Affiliates, and the officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisers and representatives of each such person
(collectively, " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") and hold Seller Indemnitees harmless
from and after the Closing Date for any and all Losses actually suffered or
incurred by Seller Indemnitees, arising out of or resulting from the breach of
(i) any representation or warranty of Buyer or Parent, and (ii) any covenant
or agreement of Buyer or Parent, in each case, contained in this Agreement.



 

53 Section 7.3 _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VII,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Buyer
Indemnitees against or reimburse Buyer Indemnitees for any Losses:

(i) pursuant to Section 7.2(a) unless and until (A) Buyer has notified Seller
in writing in accordance with Section 7.4 within the survival period set forth
in Section 7.1, and (B) the aggregate amount of all of Buyer Indemnitees
Losses under Section 7.2(a), in each case without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein,
exceeds $10,000,000 (in which event Seller shall be liable only for the excess
of such Losses over $10,000,000); provided, however, and in addition to the
other limitations set forth in this Section 7.3, (A) Seller shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees with respect
to Losses that relate to a specific Site unless and until the aggregate
amount of all of Buyer Indemnitees Losses related to such Site exceeds
$1,000, in which case Seller shall be liable for the full amount of such
Losses from dollar one; and (B) that no individual claim (or series of
related claims) for payment of Losses that do not relate to a specific Site
shall be deemed to be Losses pursuant to Section 7.2(a) unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $1,000, in which case Seller shall be
liable for the full amount of such Losses from dollar one; and

(ii) pursuant to Section 7.2(b) unless and until (A) Buyer has notified
Seller in writing in accordance with Section 7.4 within the survival period
set forth in Section 7.1, and (B) the aggregate amount of all of Buyer
Indemnitees Losses under Section 7.2(b) exceeds $15,000,000 (in which event
Seller shall be liable only for the excess of such Losses over $15,000,000);

provided, further, with limiting Section 7.3(c) below, that in no event shall
the aggregate indemnification liability of Seller under this Agreement exceed
the Escrow Shares plus the cash in the Escrow Account.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article VII,
Buyer shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Seller
Indemnitees against or reimburse Seller Indemnitees for any Losses pursuant to
Section 7.2(c) unless and until (i) Seller has notified Buyer in writing in
accordance with Section 7.4 within the applicable survival period, if any,
set forth in Section 7.1, and (ii) the aggregate of all of Seller Indemnitees
Losses exceeds $5,000,000, in each case without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein
(in which event Buyer shall be liable only for the excess of such Losses over
$5,000,000); provided, however, in no event shall the aggregate
indemnification liability of Buyer under this Agreement exceed an
amount equal to $75,000,000 (except, in each case, for any breach of Buyer or
Parent of Sections 5.12 and 5.13 hereof, which shall not be subject to any
limitation set forth in this Section 7.3(b)).

(c) After the Closing Date, recovery from the Escrow Account shall be Buyers
sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for Losses pursuant to Section
7.2(a) and 7.2(b).



 

54 (d) The amount of any Losses that an Indemnified Party recovers under this
Article VII shall be net of (i) any amounts which such Indemnified Party
actually recovers and collects from third parties, (ii) any Tax benefits
realized attributable or with respect to such Losses and (iii) any insurance
proceeds actually received by such Indemnified Party, less any deductibles or
retention amounts, co-payments, related premium increases or other payment
obligations that directly result from any Losses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and other costs of collection to the extent not payable or
reimbursable by third parties) that relate to or arise from the making of the
claim for indemnification. If any Tax benefits are realized after the
indemnification period provided herein, the amount of such Tax benefits shall
be promptly paid to the Indemnifying Party (as defined in Section 7.4(a))
within ten (10) Business Days of the realization of such Tax benefits.

Section 7.4 _Notice and Defense of Claims_.

(a) Any party seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(c)
above (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt notice to Seller if
pursuant to Section 7.2(a), or to Buyer if pursuant to Section 7.2(c) (each,
as is applicable, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of any matter which an
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, stating the amount of the Losses, if
known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. The obligations and liabilities of the Indemnifying
Party under this Article VII with respect to Losses arising from claims of any
third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this
Article VII (" _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by and contingent
upon the following additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party
shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VII except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claims at its expense and through counsel of its
choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party
within fifteen (15) Business Days of the receipt of such notice from the
Indemnified Party. Such assumption shall constitute an acknowledgement by
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third Party Claims. In the event the Indemnifying Party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party
Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense, but in any such case the expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be
paid by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. No such Third Party
Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



 

55 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to undertake any such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense thereof, at
the Indemnifying Partys expense. In the event the Indemnified Party is
conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys
possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party assumes
the defense against any such Third Party Claim and proposes to settle such
claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal
with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof and shall not settle any such Third Party
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, (and if unreasonably withheld, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any amounts paid by the Indemnified
Party to settle such claim which exceeded the amount that would have been paid
to settle such claim had the Indemnifying Party reasonably granted such
consent), and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume or
reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding.

(d) If any amounts for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible are
recoverable from a third party, upon indemnification of the Indemnified Party
by the Indemnifying Party for such Losses, the Indemnified Party shall assign
any rights that it may have to recover such amounts to the Indemnifying Party.

(e) Buyer shall maintain all books, records and other materials of Company
which relate to a Third Party Claim and, in the event Seller is the
Indemnifying Party under this Section 7.4, Buyer shall make available to
Seller all such books, records and materials at Sellers request.

Section 7.5 _Exclusive Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary and except as provided in Section 9.8 below, each
partys sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any
Loss (whether or not arising from Third Party Claims) due to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement by
any party shall be pursuant to, and shall be determined in accordance with
this Article VII, and each of Buyer and Seller hereby expressly waives any and
all right to pursue any and all other remedies, except with respect to claims
for fraud.

Section 7.6 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payment or
other post-closing payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes. No party shall take a
position inconsistent with the foregoing on any Tax Return or other document
filed with any governmental authority.



 

56 ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer:

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated within one hundred eighty
(180) days from the date of this Agreement for any reason, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of a representation or warranty or
failure to fulfill any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement has
been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to be
consummated on or by such date; or

(ii) if any Judgment having any of the effects set forth in Section 6.1(a)
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable.

(c) by Buyer, if Seller or Company shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by Seller or Company within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt
of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Buyer; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c) shall not be available to Buyer at any time that Buyer is in material
breach of this Agreement; and

(d) by Seller:

(i) if Buyer or Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by Buyer or Parent within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt
of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Seller provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d) shall not be available to Seller at any time that Seller is in material
breach of this Agreement;

(ii) if the Closing shall not have been consummated within one hundred twenty
(120) days from the date of this Agreement for any reason; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(ii)
shall not be available if Sellers breach of a representation or warranty or
failure to fulfill any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement has
been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to be
consummated on or by such date; or

(iii) at any time during the one (1) trading day period after the
Determination Date, if the SBA Average Closing Price is less than $18.00 per
share on the Determination Date, subject to the following provisions of
this Section 8.1(d)(iii). If Seller elects to terminate pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d)(iii), it shall promptly provide written notice to Parent of
such election. During the three (3) trading day period commencing with its
receipt of such notice, Buyer shall have the option, but not the obligation,
to increase the Cash  



 

57  Consideration by an amount equal to: (x) the difference between $18.00 and
the SBA Average Closing Price, multiplied by (y) the Stock Consideration. If
Buyer elects to increase the Cash Consideration, it shall promptly, but in any
case within the three-day period after receipt of such notice, notify Seller
of its intent to increase the Cash Consideration, whereupon such
election shall be binding on Buyer, Sellers right to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(iii) shall be terminated and this Agreement
shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except for the
adjustments to the Cash Consideration). If Seller has elected to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(iii) and Buyer has not elected
to increase the Cash Consideration, then Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all
reasonable costs and expenses associated with this Agreement, for an amount
up to $1,000,000, and the transactions contemplated hereby and the Agreement
shall be null and void, subject to Section 8.2 below.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1, the provisions of Section 5.2, Section 5.8, Article VIII and
Article IX will survive any such termination and remain in full force and
effect. In addition, the respective parties shall have and may pursue any and
all rights and remedies available to them at law or in equity. 

Section 8.3 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants, obligations
or other acts of any other party hereto or (ii) waive any inaccuracy of any
representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements,
covenants or conditions of any other party or with any conditions to its own
obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Confidentiality Agreement shall be binding unless the same shall be in
writing and duly executed by the parties hereto.

may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any

Section 9.7 _Severability; Jurisdiction_. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are

be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties
and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled,
at law or in equity.

Section 9.12 _Mutual Drafting_. This Agreement is the result of the joint
efforts of the parties hereto, and each provision hereof has been subject to
mutual consultation, negotiation and agreement of such parties, after
consultation with their respective counsel, and such parties have agreed to
use the particular language of the provisions of this Agreement, and any
questions of doubtful interpretation shall not be resolved by any rule or
interpretation against the draftsman, but rather in accordance with the fair
meaning thereof, having due regard for the benefits and rights intended to be
conferred upon the parties and the limitations and restrictions upon such
rights and benefits intended to be provided.



 

61 Section 9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_.

(a) The Disclosure Schedules do not constitute, are not intended to constitute
and shall not be construed as constituting representations or warranties of
Seller or Company except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes an
admission that any information disclosed, set forth or incorporated by
reference in the Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement is required by the
terms of this Agreement to be so disclosed, set forth or incorporated by
reference. Except where expressly required by the terms of this Agreement, it
is understood and agreed by the parties thereto that neither the
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party hereto shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between such parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described in this Agreement or included in
the Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) The inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules in connection with
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is so qualified as
to the materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be an admission by
Seller or Company that such matter is material or could have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall supplement or amend and deliver supplemental and/or
amended Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
any information first known to Seller after the date hereof which, if
existing, occurring or known at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules
or which is necessary to complete or correct any information in the Disclosure
Schedules or in any representation or warranty of Seller which has been
rendered materially inaccurate thereby. Buyer shall waive and agree not to
assert or exercise any right not to close the transactions contemplated herein
on the basis of any such supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedules
unless (i) the supplement or amendment, individually or in the aggregate with
any other supplements(s) or amendment(s), prevents Seller from satisfying any
of the conditions to Closing contained in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b),
(ii) Buyer notifies Seller within three (3) Business Days after receipt of
the supplemented or amended Disclosure Schedules that it will refuse to close
as a result of such supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedules
preventing such condition from being satisfied and (iii) Seller fails to
satisfy such condition to Closing, or cure any deficiency or breach identified
in such supplement or amendment, within thirty (30) days following the date on
which the matters identified in such supplement or amendment first arose or
became known to Seller. In the event Buyer waives and agrees not to assert any
right not to close the transactions contemplated herein due to the failure of
Seller to satisfy any of the conditions to Closing contained in Section
6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) as a result of any supplement or amendment to the
Disclosure Schedules, Buyer shall not be entitled to assert any claim after
the Closing under Article VII or otherwise for Losses against Seller relating
to the breach relating to the matter identified in such amended Disclosure
Schedules. Any such supplement or amendment will not relieve Seller of any
liability under this  



 

62  Agreement due to the inaccuracy of such previously delivered Disclosure
Schedules or any breach of any such representation or warranty under this
Agreement when made.

Section 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR SELLER IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Section 9.15 _Attorney s Fees_. In the event of any dispute between the
parties relating to the validity, construction or enforcement of
this Agreement, or of the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing
party for the prevailing partys reasonable expenses in enforcing the terms
hereof, including without limitation, attorneys fees and court costs.

[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank.]



 

63 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have each caused this Agreement to be executed
as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto
duly authorized.

64 EXHIBIT 1.1

ESCROW AGREEMENT

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of _______
___, 2006 by and between AAT HOLDINGS, LLC II, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Seller_ "), AAT COMMUNICATIONS CORP., a New York corporation ("
_Company_ "), AAT ACQUISITION, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Buyer_ "), and SBA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, a Florida corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and U.S. BANKCORP, a national banking association (the " _Escrow

herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Stock Purchase Agreement
(as defined below).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company (the " _Common Stock_ "); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase

this Agreement shall be held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms hereof as

conditions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly specified, for
all purposes of this Agreement each Escrow Share shall be deemed to have a
value equal to the SBA Average Closing Price. Adjustment. 
---|---|--- 

In the event that Seller is obligated to make a payment to Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.4(c)(i) of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the amount of such payment
being referred to as the " _Working Capital Adjustment Payment_ "), Seller
and Buyer shall jointly give written notice to Escrow Agent (the " _Adjustment
Notice_ ") with instruction that the Escrow Agent release to Buyer, within
three (3) Business Days of the date of the Adjustment Notice, a number of
Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account that is equal in value to the Working
Capital Adjustment Payment (plus, to the extent Escrow Shares included in the
Escrow Account are insufficient to satisfy the Working Capital Adjustment
Payment, an applicable amount of cash, if any, included in the Escrow
Account). Alternatively, Seller may determine in its sole discretion to pay
the Working Capital Adjustment Payment in cash and not out of any amounts
in the Escrow Account. The Adjustment Notice shall specify delivery
instructions for any distribution of Escrow Shares hereunder. Attached hereto
as __Attachment A__ are the names, titles and specimen signature of each of
the persons who are authorized to execute written notices and directions to
the Escrow Agent on behalf of Seller and Buyer, respectively.



     | 3. | Release of Escrow Shares with Respect to Indemnification
Claims. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Delivery of Claim Notice. If any Buyer Indemnitee, has incurred or
suffered any Losses under Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) of the Stock Purchase
Agreement for which such Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
thereunder, Buyer shall, on behalf of such Buyer Indemnitee and on or prior to
the Termination Date (as defined below), give written notice of such claim (a
" _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller and the Escrow Agent. Each Claim Notice shall
state in reasonable detail (i) the basis for such claim, (ii) the amount of
Losses incurred or suffered by such Buyer Indemnitee or, if not determinable,
a reasonable, good faith estimate thereof (the " _Claimed Amount_ "), (iii)
the amount of Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, required to satisfy such
Losses, and (iv) delivery instructions for any distribution of Escrow Shares
and cash, if applicable. No Buyer Indemnitee may make any new claim for
Losses after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the date that is the twelve
(12) month anniversary date of the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ ").
Attached hereto as _Attachment A_ are the names, titles and specimen
signatures of each of the persons who are authorized, on behalf of Buyer to
execute and deliver written notices and directions to the Escrow Agent.

(b) Response Notice; Uncontested Claims. Within fifteen (15) days of the date
a Claim Notice is received (the "Response Date") in accordance with Section
3(a), Seller shall provide to Buyer and to the Escrow Agent a written response
(the " _Response Notice_ ") in which Seller shall either: (i) agree that a
specified amount of the Escrow Shares and/or cash equal in value to the
Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") may be released from the Escrow
Account to Buyer Indemnitee, (ii) agree that a specified amount of Escrow
Shares and/or cash equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount may be
released from the Escrow Account to Buyer Indemnitee, or (iii) contest that
any of the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, may be released from the
Escrow Account to Buyer Indemnitee. Seller may contest the release of Escrow
Shares and/or cash based upon (i) a good faith belief that all or such portion
of the Claimed Amount  



 

\- 2 -  does not constitute Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, or (ii) any incorrect valuation or calculation of the amount of
Escrow Shares and/or cash to be released. If no Response Notice is delivered
by Seller to the Escrow Agent by the Response Date, Seller shall be deemed to
have agreed that the amount of the Escrow Shares and/or cash are equal in
value to the entire Claimed Amount and may be released from the Escrow Account
to Buyer in satisfaction of such claim(s).

(c) Uncontested Claim. If Seller agrees in the Response Notice, or is deemed
to have agreed pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3(b) above, that the
applicable number of the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, may be
released from the Escrow Account to Buyer, the Escrow Agent shall, no later
than three (3) Business Days after receipt or deemed receipt of the Response
Notice, (i) transfer, deliver, and assign to such Buyer such number of Escrow
Shares (plus, to the extent Escrow Shares included in the Escrow Account are
insufficient to satisfy the Agreed Amount, an applicable amount of cash, if
any, included in the Escrow Account) as provided in the Claim Notice or (ii)
such number of Escrow Shares and/or cash as provided in the Response Notice,
as applicable.

(d) Partially Contested Claims. If Seller in the Response Notice agrees that
the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, equal to part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to such Buyer
Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, no later than three (3) Business Days
after receipt of the Response Notice, transfer, deliver, and assign to such
Buyer Indemnitee such number of the Escrow Shares and/or cash equal to the
Agreed Amount and subject to reduction pursuant to Section 3(e). 

(e) Contested Claims. If Seller in the Response Notice contests all or any
part of any claim in a Claims Notice (a " _Contested Claim_ "), the Escrow
Agent shall not take any action regarding the release of Escrow Shares and
cash, if any, to Buyer except as hereafter specified. Until the Escrow Agent
receives (x) delivery of a copy of a settlement agreement or any other
written instructions executed by Buyer and Seller instructing the Escrow Agent
as to the resolution of such Contested Claim and the disbursement of the
Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, in respect of such Contested Claim
(the " _Settlement Agreement_ ") or (y) delivery of a copy of the final non-
appealable award of a court of competent jurisdiction resolving the Contested
Claim (accompanied by a certificate from the presenting party to the effect
that the order is final and non-appealable and that a copy of such order has
been delivered to the other parties hereto), (the " _Final Adjudication_ "),
the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold in the Escrow Account the Escrow
Shares and/or cash, as applicable, required to be retained in accordance with
this Agreement.

(f) Cash in Lieu of Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, at any time Escrow Shares shall be released and delivered to Buyer
pursuant to Sections 2 or 3 hereof, Seller may direct that, to the extent
available in the Escrow Account, such amounts be satisfied, in whole or in
part, with and paid in a like amount of cash.



     | 4. | Release of Escrow Shares after Six Months. 
---|---|--- 

On the date that is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date hereof,
the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account and deliver to Seller a
number of Escrow Shares  



 

\- 3 -  and, to the extent there are not sufficient Escrow Shares in the Escrow
Account, cash, if any, such that the amount and value of all Escrow Shares and
cash remaining in the Escrow Account thereafter equals $50 million plus an
amount equal to the amount of (i) all then pending Contested Claims and (ii)
all Agreed Amounts that have not been satisfied and paid as of such date
(the " _Reduced Escrow Amount_ "). To the extent that there is any cash
included in the Escrow Account, Seller may direct the Escrow Agent to
substitute cash in lieu of Escrow Shares as the payment to Seller in order to
reduce the amount of the Escrow Account to the Reduced Escrow Amount.



     | 5. | Election to Sell Escrow Shares by Seller. 
---|---|--- 

The parties acknowledge that Seller, in its sole discretion, may determine to
effect a sale of all or any portion of the Escrow Shares at any time, free and
clear of any encumbrances by virtue of this Agreement, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement and this Agreement. In the
event that Seller provides written notice to the Escrow Agent and Buyer that
it intends to effect such a sale of Escrow Shares, Buyer and Parent agree to
reasonably cooperate with Seller and the Escrow Agent, and to take such
further actions as are reasonably requested by Seller in order to effect the
sale of the Escrow Shares directly from the Escrow Account by the Escrow
Agent, on behalf of the Seller, subject to the restrictions set forth in
Section 2.5 of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Seller shall have the sole right
and obligation to negotiate the price and terms pursuant to which the Escrow
Shares shall be sold. Following any such sale, for each Escrow Share so
sold, (x) Escrow Agent shall release and pay to Seller an amount in cash
equal to the excess of the per share net proceeds from such sale over the SBA
Average Closing Price and deposit any remaining sales proceeds into the Escrow
Account and, if applicable, (y) Seller agrees to deposit into the Escrow
Account an amount in cash per Escrow Share sold equal to the excess of the SBA
Average Closing Price over the per share net proceeds from such sale.



     | 6. | Investment of Escrow Amount. 
---|---|--- 

Until such time as the entire Escrow Account being held by the Escrow Agent
has been released, the Escrow Agent shall, as soon as reasonably possible,
invest and reinvest any cash that may be included the Escrow Account from time
to time in: (i) United States Treasury Bills with maturities not exceeding 26
weeks, (ii) short-term obligations in registered form (other than U.S.
Treasury Bills) issued or guaranteed as to interest and principal by the
government of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof,
(iii) short-term non-agency mortgage-backed securities in registered form
rated AAA (or the equivalent investment grade) by Standard and Poors
Corporation or Aaa (or the equivalent investment grade) by Moodys Investor
Service, Inc., or (iv) short-term (less than 90 days) certificates of deposit
issued by United States banks or trust companies having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than $100,000,000. The Escrow Agent may make any and all
investments permitted by this Section 6 through its own bond or investment
department. The Escrow Agent shall have the power to sell or liquidate the
foregoing investments whenever the Escrow Agent shall be required to
distribute all or any portion of Escrow Account in accordance with this
Agreement.



 

\- 4 - ---|---|--- 

(a) Payment of Taxes by Seller. Seller shall be deemed the owner of the
Escrow Shares and/or cash in the Escrow Account, as applicable, and shall be
responsible for the preparation, filing and payment of all tax returns and
taxes due associated with such Escrow Shares (" _Taxes_ "). It shall be the
sole responsibility of Seller to report all income, if any, that is earned on,
or derived from, any cash included in the Escrowed Amount that is allocable to
Seller, in the taxable year or years in which such income is properly
includible and pay any Taxes attributable thereto. The Escrow Agent, in order
to assist Seller in the preparation of tax forms and the payment of Taxes,
shall take such steps and provide such forms to Seller as is necessary for
Seller to make all such filings and payments accurate and timely. Further, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to make such withholdings as it deems necessary and
proper from any distribution of the Escrow Shares and/or cash in the
Escrow Account, as applicable, to comply with its own obligations under the
United States Internal Revenue Code.

(b) Payment of Taxes by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any and all
Taxes attributable to the ownership of any cash included in the Escrowed
Amount that is released to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement.

Buyer, Parent and Seller do such things and take such actions, and will
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent such instructions and certificates
hereunder, as may be reasonably required to give effect to the provisions of
this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the execution and delivery of
appropriate stock powers and written letters of direction to Parents transfer
agent and registrar in respect of the cancellation, issuance and delivery of
new stock certificates and such other matters as may be necessary to effect
the provisions hereof.



     | 9. | Escrow Agent. 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities, including,
without limitation, any duty to review or interpret the Stock Purchase
Agreement, except those expressly set forth herein. Except for this Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent is not a party to, or bound by, any agreement
that may be required under, evidenced by, or arise out of the Stock Purchase
Agreement.

(b) If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive instructions from any of the undersigned with
respect to the Escrow Account, which, in its opinion, are in conflict with any
of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain
from taking any action until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by a
joint direction of Buyer and Seller or by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any notice,
request, waiver, consent, receipt or other document reasonably believed in
good faith by the Escrow Agent to be signed by the proper party or parties.



 

\- 5 - (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error or judgment or for any
act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith or for any mistake of
fact or law, or for anything that it may do or refrain from doing in
connection herewith, except its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and the Escrow Agent shall have no duties to anyone except those
signing this Escrow Agreement (and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns).

(d) The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel in the event of any dispute or
question as to the construction of this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow
Agents duties hereunder, and the Escrow Agent shall incur no liability and
shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or omitted in good
faith in accordance with the opinion and instructions of such counsel.

(e) In the event of any disagreement between the undersigned or any of them,
and/or any other person, resulting in adverse claims and demands being made in
connection with or for the Escrow Shares or the cash in the Escrow Account,
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled at its option to refuse to comply with any
such claim or demand, so long as such disagreement shall continue, and in so
doing the Escrow Agent shall not be or become liable for damages or interest
to the undersigned or any of them or to any person named herein for its
failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting or adverse demands. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue so to refrain and refuse so to act
until all differences shall have been resolved by agreement and the Escrow
Agent shall have been notified thereof in writing signed by Buyer and Seller
or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of such
disagreement which continues for sixty (60) days or more, the Escrow Agent or
any other party in its discretion may file a suit in interpleader or other
appropriate action for the purpose of having the respective rights of the
claimants adjudicated, if the Escrow Agent determines such action to be
appropriate under the circumstances, and may deposit with the court all
documents and property held hereunder. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, agree to pay all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Escrow Agent in such action, including reasonable attorneys fees, it
being understood that the parties will use reasonable efforts to cause such
costs and expenses to be included and apportioned between Buyer and Seller in
the judgment in any such action (and absent such apportionment, Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand shall bear equal shares of such costs
and expenses).

(f) The Escrow Agent is hereby indemnified by Buyer and Seller from all
losses, costs and expenses that may be incurred by it as a result of its
involvement in any arbitration or litigation arising from the performance of
its duties hereunder, provided that such losses, costs and expenses shall not
have resulted from the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Escrow Agent. Such indemnification shall be borne in equal proportions by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and shall survive
termination of this Escrow Agreement until extinguished by any applicable
statute of limitations.

(g) The Escrow Agent does not own or have any interest in the Escrow Account
or the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, but is serving as escrow holder
only, having only possession thereof and agreeing to hold and distribute the
Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Escrow Agreement. This paragraph shall survive
notwithstanding any termination of this Escrow Agreement or the resignation of
the Escrow Agent.



 

\- 6 - (h) The Escrow Agent (and any successor escrow agent) may at any time resign
as such by delivering the Escrow Shares and cash, if applicable, to (i) any
banking corporation or trust company organized under the laws of the United
States or of any state which corporation or company is jointly designated by
the other parties hereto in writing as successor escrow agent and consents in
writing to act as successor escrow agent or (ii) any court of competent
jurisdiction; whereupon the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and from any
and all further obligations arising in connection with this Escrow Agreement.
The resignation of the Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of (x) the
appointment of a successor escrow agent by designation by the other parties to
this Escrow Agreement, the acceptance of such successor escrow agent of the
appointment as Escrow Agent, and delivery of the Escrow Shares and/or cash in
the Escrow Account to such successor escrow agent (or delivery of the Escrow
Shares and any such cash to any court of competent jurisdiction) or (y) the
day that is 60 days after the date of delivery of its written notice of
resignation to the other parties hereto. If at that time the Escrow Agent has
not received a designation of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agents
sole responsibility after that time shall be to safekeep the Escrow Shares
and/or cash in the Escrow Account until receipt of a designation of successor
escrow agent, a joint written instruction as to disposition of the Escrow
Shares and/or cash in the Escrow Account by the other parties hereto, or a
final order of a court of competent jurisdiction mandating disposition of the
Escrow Shares and or cash in the Escrow Account.

(i) The Escrow Agent hereby accepts its appointment and agrees to act as
escrow agent under the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement
and acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Shares. Buyer and Seller shall split
the payment for Escrow Agents services hereunder the Escrow Agents
compensation set forth in Schedule I hereto. Buyer and Seller further agree to
reimburse the Escrow Agent for all reasonable out of pocket expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Escrow Agent in the
performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees and out of
pocket expenses and disbursements of its counsel).



     | 10. | Dividends and Voting 
---|---|--- 

(a) Dividends, Interest, Etc. Any securities distributable in respect of or
in exchange for any of the Shares, whether by way of stock splits or otherwise
(excluding stock dividends), shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent, who shall
hold such securities in the Escrow Account. Such securities shall be issued
in the name of Seller, and shall be considered Escrow Shares. Any stock
dividends, cash dividends or other property shall be distributed to Seller.

(b) Voting of Shares. On any matter brought before Seller for a vote, Seller
shall deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent ("Voting Notice") setting
forth the manner in which the Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrow Shares.
Seller shall deliver the Voting Notice to the Escrow Agent at least five (5)
days prior to the date of the taking of any vote (the "Voting Notice Date").
The Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrow Shares in proportions as indicated by
Seller. The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to vote any of the Escrow
Shares if no Voting Notice is received prior to the Voting Notice Date or
if such notice does not clearly set forth the manner in which the Escrow
Agent shall vote the Escrow Shares.



 

\- 7 - ---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall terminate upon the later of (i) the Termination Date or
(ii) the date that all Claimed Amounts have been resolved claims in accordance
with this Agreement. Within three (3) Business Days after the Termination
Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Seller, on behalf of Buyer, (i)
all of the Escrow Shares and cash then remaining in the Escrow Account,
including any shares received with respect to the Escrow Shares prior to the
Termination date pursuant to stock splits or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Claim Notice has been given and such claim has not yet been
resolved, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow Account after the
Termination Date the number of Escrow Shares and/or cash, if applicable,
equal in the aggregate to the Claimed Amount in a Claims Notice or Contested
Claim, as the case may be, in each case without regard to any potential
insurance payments related thereto (as well as any amounts the Escrow
Agent reasonably determines are necessary to satisfy the fees and expenses
contemplated by Section 9), which has not then been resolved.



     | 12. | Entire Agreement. 
---|---|---

entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof

this Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement shall be binding unless the
same shall be in writing and duly executed by the parties hereto. In case of
any discrepancy or conflict between this Agreement and the Stock Purchase
Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, this Agreement shall
govern.

named herein and their respective successors. No party may assign either this
