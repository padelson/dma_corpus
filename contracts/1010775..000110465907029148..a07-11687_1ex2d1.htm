 **2.2. ****_Purchase Price._**

  

(a) As consideration for each Portfolio Segment, the Purchaser agrees to pay
to the Seller the Purchase Price, payable as a Closing Payment and as a Post-
Closing Payment as set forth in this **_Section 2.2_**.

  

(b) The Purchaser agrees to pay to the Seller at the Closing for a Portfolio
Segment (the " ** _Closing Payment_** ") ** __** an amount equal to:

  

(i) the Segment Base Purchase Price, _plus_ or  _minus_ (as the case may be)

  

(ii) the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

(c) Not less than 20 Business Days prior to the Closing Date for a Portfolio
Segment, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a written statement (the "
** _Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Statement_** ") substantially in the
form contained in **_Attachment II_** hereto, setting forth in reasonable
detail the Sellers good faith calculation of the estimate of the Purchase
Price Adjustment for such Portfolio Segment as of the Closing Date (the " **
_Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment_** "), which estimate shall be based on
the Sellers review of the financial and other books and records of the
Portfolio Companies included in such Portfolio Segment then available to the
Seller. Such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error for
purposes of determining the Closing Payment.

  

(d) As promptly as practicable, and in any event not later than 60 calendar
days after the Closing Date for a Portfolio Segment, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller a written statement (the " ** _Final_**
**_Purchase Price_** **_Adjustment Statement_** ") substantially in the form
contained in **_Attachment II_** hereto, setting forth in reasonable detail
the Purchasers good faith calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment for
such Portfolio Segment as of the Closing Date, as derived from the
Purchasers review of the financial and other books and records of the
Portfolio Companies included in such Portfolio Segment and, based thereon, a
statement of the Purchasers good faith calculation of the Post-Closing
Payment.

  

(i) The Purchaser agrees to give the Seller and its Representatives full
access to such employees, officers, outside accountants, facilities, books,
records, work papers, historical financial information and other materials of
the Purchaser and the Portfolio Companies as the Seller and its
Representatives may request in connection with the Sellers review of
such Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.

  

(ii) The Seller may, in good faith, dispute the calculations contained in
such Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement by delivery of written notice
thereof (a " ** _Dispute Notice_** ") to the Purchaser within 60 calendar days
following receipt by the Seller of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail all items
disputed by the Seller, together with the Sellers proposed changes thereto,
including an explanation in reasonable detail of the basis on which the
Seller proposes such changes.

  

(iii) If (A) by written notice to the Purchaser within the 60-day period
referred to in clause (ii) above, the Seller accepts such Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement, or (B) the Seller fails to deliver a Dispute
Notice within such 60-day period (which failure shall result in the Seller
being deemed to have agreed to such Final Purchase Price Adjustment

        

Statement delivered by the Purchaser), such Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement delivered by the Purchaser (and the Post-Closing Payment set forth
therein) shall become final and binding on the Parties as of the date of such
acceptance or deemed acceptance.

  

(iv) If the Seller shall have timely delivered a Dispute Notice, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall attempt to reach agreement on the matters
identified in the Dispute Notice.  If, within 30 calendar days from the
Purchasers receipt of the Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
not have reached a resolution in writing of the matters identified in the
Dispute Notice, then such matters shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution. The Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the
Independent Accountants to prepare and deliver, within 30 calendar days
of such submission, a revised Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement
(including the calculation of the Post-Closing Payment) taking into account
all items not in dispute between the Purchaser and the Seller and those items
requested by the Purchaser and the Seller to be resolved by the
Independent Accountants. The Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Independent Accountants access to such employees, officers,
outside accountants, facilities, books, records, work papers, historical
financial information and other materials of the Purchaser and the Portfolio
Companies as the Independent Accountants may request. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the
Seller. The revised Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement (including the
calculation of the Post-Closing Payment thereon) delivered by the Independent
Accountants shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller and
shall not be subject to challenge or appeal by either Party; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the amount of any Post Closing Payment due
from the Seller be greater than the amount originally claimed by the
Purchaser in its original Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.

  

(v) Payment of a Post-Closing Payment, plus in each case interest on
such amount from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date
of payment at the Specified Rate, shall be made by the respective Party owing
such payment to the other Party within five Business Days following the date
such Post-Closing Payment is deemed to be finally determined pursuant to
the foregoing clauses (iii) or (iv) above.  Such payment shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by the Party entitled to receive such payment.

  

 **2.3. _Closing_**.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of **_Section 2.3(c)_** and the
other provisions of this Agreement, proceedings for the consummation of the
Transaction with respect to a Portfolio Segment (a " ** _Closing_** ") shall
take place at the offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP, 1615 L Street, NW, Suite
800, Washington, D.C. 20036, or such other location agreed by the Parties,
at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time, on a mutually acceptable date within 20 Business
Days following the date on which the Closing Conditions for such Portfolio
Segment (other than

        

those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,)
have been either satisfied or waived by the Party for whose benefit such
conditions exist, or at such other time and place as the Parties may mutually
agree, and in any event after the Target Date but prior to the Termination
Date. The date on which such proceedings actually occur is referred to herein
as a " ** _Closing Date_**." For the avoidance of doubt, more than one
Closing may occur on a single Closing Date. The Parties agree that the first
Closing shall, at a minimum, include the Jamaica Segment and either of the
Trinidad Segment or the Bahamas Segment.

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of **_Section 10.1 _** and **_Section
2.3(c)_** , the Parties agree that they will make all reasonable efforts (in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Agreement), to effect
Closings of all four Portfolio Segments on a single Closing Date (a " **
_Comprehensive Closing_** ") on or before the Target Closing Date or as soon
thereafter as may be practicable.

  

(c) If the Closing Conditions shall have been satisfied (or waived) for the
Jamaica Segment and either of the Trinidad Segment or the Bahamas Segment,
the Seller shall have the option, on not less than 10 Business Days prior
written notice to the Purchaser, to defer a Closing for a reasonable period
in order to achieve a Closing for three Portfolio Segments or a Comprehensive
Closing; _provided_ , that such deferred Closing shall occur not later than
90 days after the date such Closing was otherwise scheduled to occur but in
no event after the Termination Date.

  

(d) All actions scheduled in this Agreement for a Closing Date shall be
deemed to occur simultaneously at the corresponding Closing.  Except as
otherwise provided in **_Section 10.1_**, failure to consummate the
Transaction provided for in this Agreement on the date determined pursuant to
this **_Section 2.3_**  will not result in the termination of this Agreement
and will not relieve any Party of any obligation under this Agreement.

  

 **2.4. _Closing Deliveries by the Seller to the Purchaser_**. At a Closing,
the Seller shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser

Portfolio Company and the officers and employees of such Portfolio Company,
but only to the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of the Seller or of the Portfolio Companies and
that such access is reasonably related to the Purchasers rights and
obligations hereunder; _provided_ , that the Seller shall have the right to:
(i) have a Representative present for any communication by the Purchaser with
officers or employees of the Portfolio Companies; and (ii) impose reasonable
restrictions and requirements for safety purposes;

  

 _provided further_ , that in no event shall the Seller be obligated to
provide any access or information if the Seller determines, in good faith,
that providing such access or information may violate Applicable Law, cause
the Seller or its Affiliates to breach a confidentiality obligation to which
it is bound or jeopardize any recognized legal privilege available to the
Seller or its Affiliates. In connection with the foregoing, the Purchaser
shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to have the Assets of each
Portfolio Company surveyed and to conduct physical inspections, including
Phase I Testing (but not invasive testing, other environmental testing,
sampling or audits or any other similar procedure) of such Assets. ** _
_**The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with not less than three Business
Days prior written notice of the date and time on which any such entry upon
the property of any Portfolio Company shall occur. Promptly upon completion
of any such entry, the Purchaser shall repair any damage caused by such
entry.

  

(b) During the Interim Period, the Seller and the Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives shall cooperate in good faith
to arrange meetings between themselves, their respective Affiliates
and Representatives, and officials of Governmental Authorities and
counterparties to Contracts with Portfolio Companies.

  

(c) The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller for
any and all Losses incurred by the Seller, its Representatives or any other
Person arising out of the access rights under this **_Section 6.2_** ,
including any Claims by any of the Purchasers Representatives for any
injuries or Losses while present on the properties of the Seller or of the
Portfolio Companies.

Seller shall, during the Interim Period, cause each MCH Company to take, and,

the ordinary course or business;

foregoing shall not preclude any such actions if the obligations and
liabilities that are created pursuant to any such actions are satisfied prior
to the respective Closing Date or are otherwise taken into account in the
computation of the Purchase Price Adjustment for such MCH Company or its
Portfolio Segment; and

  

(xxii) enter into any agreement to do any of the foregoing in contravention
of this **_Section 6.3._**

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller may permit the
Portfolio Companies: (i) to perform, consent to or authorize any action which
it may reasonably determine to be required by Applicable Law or Contract;
(ii) to perform, consent to or authorize any action which it may reasonably
determine to be required to conduct studies and/or respond to requests for

_provided, however_ , that JPS shall not enter into any agreement relating to
the Jamaica Expansion Project that has a term greater than one year or
which commits JPS to make payments during any one year in excess of
$1,000,000 in the aggregate; (iii) if and to the extent that the Seller shall
so determine, in its sole discretion, and so long as no material expense or
Tax that is not reflected in the computation of the Purchase Price Adjustment
shall result therefrom, perform, consent to or authorize any action which it
may reasonably determine to be required in connection with the transfer,
prior to the Closing Date for the Curacao Segment, of the capital stock of
Mirant Curacao Investments, Ltd. from Mirant Bahamas Investments Limited to
MCH, the Seller or another Person that is a wholly-owned direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Seller; (iv) if the Closing of the Jamaica Segment shall
not be a Comprehensive Closing and if the Seller shall determine in its sole
discretion that MCH is to be the Transferred Segment Holding Company for the
Jamaica Segment (and, therefore, that the MCH Group is included in the
Jamaica Segment) and so long as no material expense or Tax that is not
reflected in the computation of the Purchase Price Adjustment shall result
therefrom, perform, consent to or authorize any action which it may
reasonably determine to be required

        

in connection with the transfer, prior to the Closing Date for the Jamaica
Segment, of the capital stock of each Transferred Segment Holding Company for
those Portfolio Segments not included in the Transferred Interests on such
Closing Date to the Seller or another Person that is a wholly-owned direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Seller; and (v) to take commercially reasonable
actions with respect to unanticipated or emergency situations, so long as, in
each such case, the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser thereof in
writing.

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) give the
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations or activities of any Portfolio Company prior to the Closing for
the Portfolio Segment in which such Portfolio Company is included; or (ii)
obligate the Seller or Transferor, directly or indirectly, to control or
direct the operations of any Portfolio Company on or after such Closing.
Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall exercise, consistent with the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control over its rights and
obligations pertaining to the Portfolio Companies.

  

(d) During the Interim Period for each Portfolio Company, the Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Portfolio Company to
preserve its goodwill and present business relationships with all customers,
suppliers, licensors, distributors and others having business relationships
with the business of such Portfolio Company, to the extent such relationships
are beneficial to such Portfolio Company.

  

 **6.4.** ** ****_Resignation of Managers and Officers_** _. _At the Closing
for each Portfolio Segment: (i) the Seller shall cause the resignation of all
directors, members, managers and officers, as applicable, nominated or
appointed by the Seller or its Affiliates to any board or operating,
management or other committee of the Portfolio Companies included in such
Portfolio Segment; and (ii) the Purchaser shall nominate and
appoint replacement directors, members, managers and officers, as may be
required for the operation of such Portfolio Companies.

  

 **6.5.** ** ****_Use of Certain Names_** _._

  

(a) Within 60 calendar days following each Closing, the Purchaser shall cause
the Portfolio Companies included in such Closing to cease using the word
"Mirant" or any other words or marks owned by the Seller or any word or
expression similar thereto or constituting an abbreviation or extension
thereof (the " ** _Seller Marks_** "), including eliminating such words from
the Assets and disposing of any unused stationery and literature of the
Portfolio Companies bearing such words, and thereafter, the Purchaser, such
Portfolio Companies and their Affiliates shall not use any Intellectual
Property rights belonging to the Seller or any Affiliate thereof, and the
Purchaser acknowledges that it has no rights whatsoever to use such
Intellectual Property.  Notwithstanding the foregoing the Purchaser is deemed
to have "removed" the Seller Marks on training and operational material and
manuals if it places a conspicuous, permanent notice on, at a minimum, the
front cover and title page of the material or manuals, clearly indicating
that such Portfolio Companies are no longer Affiliates of, or otherwise
associated with, the Seller or any of the Sellers Affiliates. In connection
with the Purchasers removal of the Seller Marks provided herein, the Seller
grants the Purchaser a non-exclusive limited license to use the Seller Marks
in existence or present on the Closing Date at such Portfolio Companies for
15 calendar days following such Closing.

  

(b) Within 30 calendar days after each Closing, the Purchaser shall
provide evidence to the Seller, in a form substantially as set out in
**_Exhibit D_** , that the Purchaser has provided notice to all applicable
Governmental Authorities and all counterparties to the Material

        

Contracts regarding the acquisition of the Transferred Stock by the Purchaser
and the new addresses for notice purposes.

  

 **6.6.** ** ****_Support Obligations_**.

  

(a) The Purchaser recognizes that the Seller and the Non-MCH Affiliates have
provided credit and other contractual support and assurances to or for
the benefit of the MCH Companies with respect to their business and Assets
pursuant to the obligations designated as " _Support Obligations_ " in the
Company Schedules (the " ** _Support Obligations_** ").

  

(b) Effective as of each Closing Date for a Portfolio Segment, the Seller and
the Purchaser shall together use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the full and unconditional release of the Seller and the Non-
MCH Affiliates from the Support Obligations related to such Portfolio
Segment, including by:

  

(i) The Purchaser or the Purchaser Parent providing substitute guarantees or
assurances with the same terms as the existing guarantees;

  

(ii) furnishing letters of credit containing terms and conditions that
are substantially identical to the terms and conditions of existing letters
of credit and from lending institutions that have a Credit Rating
commensurate with that of lending institutions for existing letters of
credit;

  

(iii) instituting escrow arrangements with terms comparable to or
more favorable to the counterparty than the terms of existing escrow
arrangements;

  

(iv) posting surety or performance bonds issued by a Person having a
net worth or a Credit Rating at least equal to those of the issuer of
existing surety or performance bonds, and which replacement surety or
performance bond contains terms and conditions that are substantially
identical to the terms and conditions of existing surety or performance
bonds; and,

  

(v) replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on
substantially identical terms and conditions to the existing security
agreement or arrangement.

  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
cooperate with the goal of causing the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such
Support Obligations to terminate and redeliver to the Seller on the Closing
Date each original copy of each original guarantee, letter of credit or other
instrument or document constituting or evidencing such Support Obligations.

  

(d) If the Seller and the Purchaser are not successful, following the use of
commercially reasonable efforts, in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of the Seller and the Non-MCH Affiliates from such
Support Obligations prior to such Closing Date, then the Purchaser shall
cause the Purchaser Parent to provide a Purchaser Parent Guaranty with
respect to such Support Obligations. Furthermore, the Purchaser agrees, for
so long as any Support Obligation remains outstanding, not to, and to cause
the corresponding

        

MCH Companies not to, effect any amendments or modifications or any other
changes to the Contracts to which any of such Support Obligations relate, or
to otherwise take any action that would effect any change to such
Contracts, guarantees or letters of credit in either case, in a manner that
would increase, extend, or accelerate the liability of the Seller or the Non-
MCH Affiliates under any Support Obligation, without the Sellers prior
written consent.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, during
the Interim Period, and for so long as any Support Obligation remains
outstanding, the Seller and the Purchaser shall each have the right, after
reasonable written notice to the other, to contact and have discussions with
each beneficiary of a Support Obligation in order to satisfy its obligations
under this **_Section 6.6_**;  _provided_ , that the other Party shall
have the right to have one of its Representatives present during any
such contact or discussion; and each Party shall cause such Representatives
to comply with all procedures and protocols regarding such contacts
and discussions that may be reasonably established by the Parties.

  

 **6.7.** ** ****_Further Assurances_** _. _Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at any time, or from time to time, after the
Closing, at any Partys request and without further consideration, the other
Party shall execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale,
transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the Transaction.

  

 **6.8.** ** ****_Employee Obligations._**

  

(a) Not later than 30 days after the Effective Date, the Seller shall provide
to the Purchaser a list of employees of the Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the MCH Companies) that Seller and such Affiliates will make available
to Purchaser (the " ** _Available Employees_** "), to discuss potential
employment with Purchaser (which discussions the Parties agree shall not
violate **_Section 12.5_** )), which list shall include each employees name,
job title, work location, and current employment status (i.e., active, on
leave of absence, on vacation, etc.) as of the Effective Date. The Purchaser
shall have the option to make an offer of employment to each Available
Employee whom it desires to employ on such terms and conditions as the
Purchaser shall determine in its sole discretion. Any contacts by the
Purchaser and each Available Employee shall be subject to such restrictions
concerning time, frequency and manner as the Seller may reasonably determine.

  

(b) Not later than 60 days after the Effective Date, the Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller a list that sets forth the names of each Available
Employee who has agreed to accept employment with Purchaser (each, a " **
_Hired Employee_** ") and the date that such Available Employees employment
with Purchaser is expected to commence.

  

(c) Not later than the date each Hired Employee commences employment with the
Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof, such Hired Employee shall cease
to participate actively or be eligible to participate actively in all
"employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA of
Seller or its Affiliates providing benefits to any Available Employees (the
"Seller Plans"). The Purchaser shall not assume any of the Seller Plans.

  

(d) The Parties agree to cooperate to the extent reasonably required so that
their respective rights and responsibilities under this **_Section 6.8_**
are managed in a manner that complies with the requirements of the
privacy standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information.

        

 **6.9.** ** ** **_Employee Benefit Matters_**. During the two-year period
following the Closing Date for each Portfolio Segment, the Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Transferred Interest
included in such Portfolio Segment to provide to employees who immediately
before the Closing are employed by such Transferred Interest and remain
employed following such Closing Date (the " ** _Company_   _Employees_** "),
for so long as each such Company Employee remains so employed by such
Transferred Interest, salary and employee benefits that, with respect to each
Company Employee, are substantially comparable to the salary and employee
benefits that such Company Employee enjoyed and to which such Company
Employee would have been entitled under Applicable Laws, Contracts, policies,
practices and Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing.  To
that purpose, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that, with respect to each Transferred Interest for the two-
year period following such Closing Date:

  

(a) each such Company Employee who incurs a termination of employment during
such period shall receive severance payments and severance benefits that are
substantially comparable to the severance payments and severance benefits to
which such Company Employee would have been entitled under Applicable
Laws, Contract, policies and practices as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing;

  

(b) such Transferred Interest shall give Company Employees full credit
for such Company Employees service with such company for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits under any
Benefit Plans and other employment policies to the same extent recognized by
such Transferred Interest immediately prior to the Closing (provided that
such credit does not result in duplication of benefits); and

  

(c) such Transferred Interest: (i) waives any preexisting
condition limitations or period-of-employment limitations otherwise
applicable to Company Employees and their eligible dependents under any
Benefit Plan or plan that replaces any Benefit Plan, other than any
limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees immediately
before the Closing; and (ii) waives any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Company
Employee and his or her eligible dependents at or after the Closing, in each
case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied
any similar limitation or requirement prior to the Closing.

  

Notwithstanding anything set forth in this **_Section 6.9_** ,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
or policy, or shall limit the right of the Purchaser or any Portfolio Company
to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan or any employee
benefit plan maintained or contributed to by the Purchaser or any Portfolio
Company following the Closing Date, nor shall any provision of any such
Benefit Plan, benefit or policy be deemed to be amended, terminated or
otherwise modified hereby. The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in this **_Section 6.9_** are
included for the sole benefit of the Seller and the Purchaser, and that
nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without
limitation, any Company Employees, any participant in any Benefit Plan, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
the Purchaser or any Portfolio Company.

  

 **6.10.** ** ****_Certain Other Terms_** _._ Notwithstanding any term or
provision hereof, the following provisions shall apply:

  

(a) Prior to the Closing for each Portfolio Segment, except as
otherwise agreed in the Transition Services Agreement, the Seller shall take
such actions as may be necessary to terminate or sever (with appropriate
mutual releases) upon such Closing any services jointly

        

shared or used by the corresponding Portfolio Companies and the Seller or a
Non-MCH Affiliate, including the termination or severance of
insurance policies (including those policies referred to in **_Section
6.11_** ), joint Tax services, joint legal services and joint banking
services (to include the severance of any centralized clearance accounts) and
each Contract listed on **_Schedule 6.10_** (the **_"Terminated Contracts"_**
).

  

(b) At or prior to the Closing for each Portfolio Segment, the Seller
shall take such actions as may be necessary to terminate or retire any
indebtedness owing from any Portfolio Company in such Portfolio Segment to
any Non-MCH Affiliate.

  

(c) At the Closing for each Portfolio Segment, all accounts
receivable, accounts payable and trade payables of the corresponding
Transferred Interests shall remain with the Transferred Interests.  All
invoices for goods purchased, or services performed, pertaining to such
Transferred Interests or their businesses, for goods purchased or
services rendered whether before or after the Execution Date or the Closing
Date shall be for the sole account of the Transferred Interests, and the
Seller shall not be liable in any way thereby. Following a Closing, the
Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the
MCH Companies that is a Transferred Interest to perform all of
its obligations and commitments arising before or after the Execution Date or
the Closing Date.

  

(d) The Seller shall have the right to cause the Portfolio Companies to
pay dividends or distributions of cash to the Seller in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practices at any time prior to such
Portfolio Company becoming part of a Transferred Interest.

  

(e) Within 15 calendar days after the Closing of the Jamaica Segment,
the Purchaser shall (directly or through one of its Affiliates) make a Change
of Control Offer under and in compliance with _Section 3.22(e)_ of the JPS
Indenture, with a specified Change of Control Payment Date to occur 30 days
after the date of such Change of Control Offer; and the Purchaser shall take
all other actions (including the timely performance of such Change of Control
Offer) necessary for said _Section 3.22(e)_ to be applicable to any and all
obligations under the JPS Indenture relating to a Change of Control Offer.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand and agree that the
Purchaser may extend the Change of Control Offer through any 100%-owned
Affiliate within the Jamaica Segment, but in no event shall such Change of
Control offer be extended by, or any obligations or liabilities in respect
thereof be incurred (directly or indirectly) by, JPS.

  

(f) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause all
receivables and payables between the relevant Portfolio Company, on the one
hand, and any of the Seller or its Affiliates (excluding any Portfolio
Company), on the other hand, to be paid in full or otherwise extinguished in
a manner that does not increase any Tax liability or decrease any Tax asset
of any Portfolio Company.

  

 **6.11.** ** ****_Insurance_** _. _Notwithstanding any term or provision to
the contrary, the following provisions shall apply as to the matters set
forth herein:

  

(a) As of each Closing Date, the Seller shall have no obligation to
procure or maintain any insurance for the benefit of the corresponding
Transferred Interests. To the extent of insurance policies that cease to be
in effect at such Closing, the Purchaser shall obtain, or assist the
respective Portfolio Companies to obtain, replacement insurance coverage that
is reasonably consistent with historical practices. In no event shall the
Seller or

        

any Non-MCH Affiliate be obligated to maintain in effect, procure in lieu
thereof, or pay any costs or premiums relating to, any insurance coverage for
such Transferred Interests after such Closing.

  

(b) Not more than 15 Business Days after the Effective Date, the Seller will
provide to the Purchaser a description of the insurance policies maintained
by or for the account of the Portfolio Companies that will cease upon a
Closing, and which are to be replaced by comparable insurance
coverage procured by the Purchaser and in effect at the applicable Closing.

  

(c) From and after each Closing Date, for a period of six years from
the respective Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that:

  

(i) to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law and their respective
Charter Documents, there is no material adverse change to any obligation of a
Transferred Interest, as of the Closing Date, to indemnify and hold harmless
each former employee, agent, director or officer of such company against any
costs or expenses or liabilities (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition) arising from any actual or
threatened Claim in connection with any action or omission by such Person in
his or her capacity as an employee, agent, director or officer occurring or
alleged to have occurred on or prior to the Closing Date; and

  

(ii) except to the extent required by Law, the Purchaser will not take
any action to amend, modify or repeal provisions for such indemnification as
may exist in the Charter Documents of such corresponding Transferred
Interest, or to modify insurance coverage relating thereto, in a manner that
would reduce the benefits thereof to former employees, agents, directors or
officers.

  

 **6.12.** ** ****_Seller s Covenants Relating to the Closing Conditions_**
_._

  

(a) Promptly upon the same becoming available, and in any event not less than
five Business Days prior to the first Closing Date, the Seller shall provide
to the Purchaser the Audited Company Financial Statements for the following
Portfolio Companies:

  

(i) Mirant Trinidad Investments, LLC;

  

(ii) Power Generation Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited;

  

(iii) Mirant Curaçao Investments, Ltd.;

  

(iv) CUC Holdings N.V.;

  

(v) Curaçao Utilities Company N.V.;

  

(vi) Mirant Grand Bahama Limited;

  

(vii) Grand Bahama Power Company Limited; and

        

(viii) JPS.

  

(b) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or with the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, during the Interim Period for each
Portfolio Company, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
bring about for the corresponding Portfolio Segment, as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, the satisfaction of all the Closing Conditions set
forth in **_Article 8_**.

  

 **6.13.** ** ****_Purchaser s Covenants Relating to the Closing
Conditions_** _._

  

(a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or with the prior
written consent of the Seller, during the Interim Period for each Portfolio
Company the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to bring
about for the corresponding Portfolio Segment, as soon as practicable after
the date hereof, the satisfaction of all the conditions for Closing set forth
in **_Article 9_**.

  

(b) The Purchaser shall obtain the Funds, and be in a position to immediately
satisfy the Funding Obligations, in each case as promptly as reasonably
practicable so that the Closing Dates shall not in any event be delayed or
deferred by reason of the Purchasers lack of Funds. The Purchaser shall
promptly advise the Seller of any material developments prior to each Closing
Date that may adversely affect its ability to timely fulfill its Funding
Obligations on and following such Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that its obligations hereunder are not conditioned or excused in any
manner based upon any financing arrangements or conditions to which the
Purchaser may be party, or the Purchasers inability for any reason to obtain
all or any part of the Funds to satisfy the Funding Obligations.  The Seller
and its Affiliates shall provide reasonable cooperation in requests by the
Purchaser for information related to the Portfolio Companies as reasonably
required for the Purchasers financing (which financing is not a condition to
the Transaction).

  

 **6.14.** ** ****_Supplements to Company Schedules_** _._

  

(a) During the Interim Period for each Portfolio Company, the Seller
may provide written notices to the Purchaser supplementing or modifying
the information disclosed in **_Attachment I_** and the Company Schedules
for such Portfolio Company to the extent that the Seller reasonably believes
such supplements or modification to be appropriate or necessary. Each
such notice shall be effective upon the Purchasers receipt thereof in
accordance with **_Sections 12.1(b)_** and ** _12.6_**.

  

(b) In furtherance of **_Section_**   ** _6.14(a)_** , the Parties
understand and acknowledge that certain information contained in **_Attachment
I_** , as denoted therein with an asterisk, may be missing or incomplete on
the Effective Date and shall be added and completed pursuant to supplemented
**_Attachment I_** in accordance with this **_Section_**   ** _6.14_**
on or before the first Closing Date hereunder, it being further understood
that the absence of such missing or incomplete information on the Effective
Date shall not constitute a basis for a Claim under **_Section 11.1(a)(i)_**.
Further, the Parties understand and acknowledge that **_Attachment I_** will
be supplemented to reflect changes arising pursuant to **_Section
6.3(b)(iii)_**  and **_6.3(b)(iv)_**.

  

 **6.15.** ** ****_Transition Services_** _. _Promptly following execution
of this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller agree to enter into good
faith negotiations relating to the possible provision by the Seller or a Non-
MCH Affiliate of transition support services, with such scope of services and
on such terms and

   

45  

   

conditions as the Parties may mutually agree (any such written agreement
relating thereto being the " ** _Transition Services Agreement_** ");
_provided,_  that neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall have any
obligation to enter into any such Transition Services Agreement and any such
Transition Services Agreement shall not be required to exist as a condition
to any Closing hereunder.

  

 **6.16.** ** _Risk of Loss_** _. _If, during the period from the date of
this Agreement until the Closing, if any of the Assets of a Portfolio Company
(" ** _Acquired Assets_** ") are damaged or destroyed by fire or other
casualty, and the uninsured portion of such Loss or damage is more than
$300,000 (as estimated in good faith by the Seller), then: (i) such Portfolio
Company shall restore, repair and/or replace the damaged or affected Acquired
Assets to a condition reasonably comparable to their prior condition; and
(ii) to the extent such Loss or damage is not restored, repaired or replaced
prior to the Closing, the Working Capital of such Portfolio Company shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the cost to restore, repair and/or replace the
damaged or affected Acquired Assets as agreed by the Seller and the Purchaser
or, in the event of a dispute, the determination of an independent third
party designated by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Parties agree that to
the extent a Loss or damage described in this **_Section 6.16_** has
been addressed through insurance payments or an adjustment to Working
Capital, it shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect for purposes of
**_Section 8.6_** or otherwise under this Agreement.

  

 **6.17.** ** _No Solicitation. _**Each of the Parties agrees that, during
the Interim Period, it shall not, and shall cause its Representatives and

combination with, in each case any or all of the Portfolio Companies; or (ii)
participate in or continue any discussions, negotiations, or other
communications regarding or, except as required by Law, furnish to any other
Person any information with respect to, or in contemplation of,
any transaction of the types described in clause (i) of this sentence.
Nothing in this **_Section 6.17_** shall restrict either (i) the Sellers
right to take actions reasonably required pursuant to the terms of the Seller
Consent Requirements or the Seller Approval Requirements or (ii) the
Purchasers right to take actions reasonably required pursuant to the terms
of the Purchaser Approval Requirements.

  

 **7.** ** TAX AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION MATTERS**

  

 **7.1.** ** _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_**.

  

(a) _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, gross receipts, use, goods and
services, value added, documentary, gains, stamp, duties, excise, recording,
transfer and conveyance Taxes and other similar Taxes (collectively, " **
_Transfer Taxes_** ") incurred in connection with the Transaction shall be
borne by the Purchaser, except that Transfer Taxes attributable to the
Bahamas Segment, if any, shall be borne equally by the Seller and the
Purchaser, and the Parties each shall accurately file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes and timely pay
all such Transfer Taxes. If required by Applicable Law, the Purchaser will
cause each MCH Company that is a Transferred Interest to join in
the execution of any such Tax Return. The Parties shall provide copies of
any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes to each other Party no later
than five calendar days after the due dates of such Tax Returns.

  

(b) _MCH Company Tax Returns._ Except as otherwise provided in **Section
_7.1(a)_**  above:

        

(i) The Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by or on behalf of each MCH Company if and to the
extent that the due date for such Tax Return (including customary extensions
thereof) occurs on or before the Closing Date for such MCH Company, and the
respective MCH Company shall remit (or cause to be remitted) in respect of
such Tax Returns any Taxes shown thereon. Except to the extent otherwise
required by Applicable Law, all such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice.

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall file and pay, or cause to be filed and paid, when
due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or on behalf of each MCH
Company in all instances where the due date (including extensions thereof)
occurs after the Closing Date for such MCH Company, and the Seller shall have
no liability or responsibility therefore except as may otherwise be expressly
provided in this Agreement. Except to the extent otherwise required by
Applicable Law, all such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice.

  

(iii) Any Tax Return required to be filed by an MCH Company after the Closing
Date for such MCH Company that relates to a taxable year or period beginning
before such Closing Date and ending on or prior to such Closing Date (a " **
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_** ") or following such Closing Date (a " **
_Straddle Period_** ") shall be provided by the Purchaser to the Seller
promptly following the filing thereof (with copies of all appropriate
supporting materials); _provided_ that with respect to Tax Returns relating
to income or profit Taxes, draft copies thereof shall be submitted (with
copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then
available) to the Seller for the Sellers approval not less than 20
Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return. If the
Seller does not provide to the Purchaser written comments to such Tax Return
at least 10 Business Days prior to such due date, the Seller shall be deemed
to have approved such Tax Return in the form submitted by the Seller; if the
Seller shall provide such written comments at least 10 Business Days prior to
such due date, the Purchaser shall incorporate (or cause the relevant MCH
Company to incorporate) such comments into such Tax Return to the fullest
extent that such comments do not conflict with (i) Applicable Law or (ii) to
the extent not mandated by Applicable Law, the past practices of such MCH
Company (including any such practices reflected in the computation of the
Purchase Price Adjustment) or (iii) to the extent not mandated by Applicable
Law and not resolved by past practices, reasonable standards of Tax practice
in such jurisdiction.  No later than five calendar days prior to the due date
thereof, upon not less than two Business Days demand from the Purchaser
specifying the amount payable, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an
amount equal to the Net Tax Liability arising from such Tax Return for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date for such MCH Company, except to the extent taken into
account in the computation of the Purchase Price Adjustment relating to such
MCH Company or its Portfolio Segment. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, Taxes shall

        

be allocated in the manner set forth in the last sentence of **_Section
7.1(c)(i)_** hereof.

  

(c) _Refunds._

  

(i) If the Purchaser or any MCH Company receives any Tax refund (including
any interest in respect thereof) that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or portion of a Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date, for any
such MCH Company, such Tax Refund shall be for the account of the Seller,
and, except to the extent that the amount of such Tax refund was taken into
account in the computation of the Purchase Price Adjustment for such MCH
Company or its Portfolio Segment, the Purchaser shall pay over (or cause such
MCH Company to pay over) to the Seller in cash the Net Tax Refund relating to
such refund (together with interest, if any) within 15 calendar days after
receipt of such refund. For purposes of this **_Section 7.1(c)_** , where it
is necessary to apportion a refund between the Purchaser and the Seller for a
Straddle Period, such refund shall be apportioned between the period
deemed to end at the close of the corresponding Closing Date and the period
deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following such Closing Date on
the basis of an interim closing of the books of the corresponding MCH
Company, except that refunds of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g., real
property Taxes) shall be allocated on a daily basis.

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall cooperate, and cause each MCH Company that is a
Transferred Interest to cooperate, in obtaining any Tax refund that the
Seller reasonably believes should be available, including through filing
appropriate forms with the applicable Tax authority; _provided, however,_
that requesting or obtaining such a Tax refund would not adversely affect the
Taxes or the Tax position of the Purchaser, such MCH Company or any
subsidiary of such MCH Company for any post-Closing taxable period or portion
thereof.

  

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate
in preparing and filing all Tax Returns with respect to the MCH Companies
included in the Transferred Interests, including maintaining and making
available to each other all records reasonably necessary in connection with
Taxes of such MCH Companies and in resolving all Disputes and audits with
respect to all Tax periods relating to Taxes of any such MCH Company.

  

(e) _Section 338(g) Elections_. The Purchaser shall not make any
election under _Section 338(g)_ of the _Code_ (or any analogous provision of
state, local, or non-United States income tax Law) with respect to the
purchase (or deemed purchase) of the equity interests of any Portfolio
Company in connection with the Transaction, without the prior written consent
of the Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the
Seller. If the Seller does so consent, the Purchaser shall be liable for, and
shall pay, any Tax attributable to, or resulting from, the making of such
election and will indemnify the Seller from and against any Tax liability or
other adverse consequences attributable to, or resulting directly or
indirectly from, the making of such election. Any indemnification obligation
of the Purchaser pursuant to this **_Section 7.1(e)_** shall be increased by
the relevant After Tax Amount. For purposes of this **_Section 7.1(e)_** , "
** _After Tax Amount_** " means any additional amount necessary to reflect
the Tax consequences of the receipt or accrual of such

        

reimbursement payment (including the payment of an additional amount or
amounts hereunder) determined by using the actual marginal United States,
state, local or non-United States rates for the relevant taxable period.

  

(f) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. On or prior to the Closing Date
for any Portfolio Segment, the Seller shall take all reasonable efforts to
cause all Tax sharing agreements between: (i) the Seller or any Non-MCH
Affiliate; and (ii) any Portfolio Companies within such Portfolio Segment, to
be terminated, and all obligations thereunder shall be settled, and no
additional payments shall be made under any provisions thereof after the
Closing Date.

  

(g) _Post-Closing Actions Affecting the Seller s Liability for Taxes_.
Except as may otherwise be required by Applicable Law or as otherwise
permitted by this Agreement:

  

(i) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each MCH Company that is a
Transferred Interest not to, take any action outside of the ordinary course
of business (other than pursuant to **_Section 7.1(e)_** hereof relating to
a Section 338(g) election) which would reasonably be expected to (A) increase
the Sellers or any Non-MCH Affiliates liability for Taxes or (B) result in
a net increase of, or change in the character of, any income or gain
(including any _subpart F_ income) that the Seller or any Non-MCH
Affiliate must report on any Tax Return.

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each MCH Company that is a
Transferred Interest not to, amend, refile, or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Portfolio Companies with respect
to any taxable year or period on or before the corresponding Closing Date
without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

(iii) The Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each MCH Company that is a
Transferred Interest not to, carryback for Tax purposes to any taxable
period, or portion thereof, of any Portfolio Company ending before, or which
includes, the corresponding Closing Date, any operating Losses, net operating
Losses, capital Losses, Tax credits or similar items arising in, resulting
from, or generated in connection with a taxable year, or portion thereof, of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates ending on or after such Closing Date.

  

 **7.2.** ** _Access to Information_**.

  

(a) After each Closing Date and for a period of seven years following the
final Closing Date hereunder, or such longer period as may be required by
Applicable Law, the Seller and the Purchaser shall grant each other (or their
respective designees), and the Purchaser shall cause each MCH Company that is
a Transferred Interest to grant to the Seller (or its designees), access at
all reasonable times to all of the information, books and records relating to
this Transaction or to the corresponding Portfolio Companies in its
possession that are not otherwise protected by legal privilege, and shall
afford such Party the right (at such Partys expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent that such Party may
reasonably request for purposes of completing or reconciling its financial
and Tax accounts.

        

(b) In furtherance of the preceding **_Section 7.2(a)_** :

  

(i) the Purchaser and the Seller agree to furnish, or cause to be furnished,
to each other and their respective Representatives, during normal business
hours, such information (including records pertinent to the MCH Companies
that are Transferred Interests and, to the extent available, the Designated
Companies) as may be reasonably necessary for financial reporting and
accounting matters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

  

(ii) the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly complete
its financial audit of the Portfolio Companies that are Transferred Interests
for the fiscal and tax years in which the corresponding Closing Date shall
occur, so as to permit the Seller to timely complete its audit for, and Tax
Returns with respect to, the same period.

  

(c) For a period of seven years after the final Closing Date hereunder, or
such longer period as shall be required by Applicable Law, the Purchaser
shall each retain all books and records in its possession relating to the
Transferred Interests (including work papers and relevant correspondence with
accountants and Tax authorities) to the extent that such books and records
relate to Taxes or the financial accounts of such Portfolio Companies through
the end of the fiscal and Tax years in which the corresponding Closing Date
shall have occurred. If the Purchaser shall desire to dispose of any of such
books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, the
Purchaser shall, prior to such disposition, give the Seller a reasonable
opportunity, at the Sellers expense, to segregate and remove such books and
records as the Seller may select.

  

 **7.3.** ** _Indemnification by the Seller. _**The Seller agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser to the extent, and subject to the
limitations, set forth in this **_Section 7.3_** and **_Section 7.3_**, from
and against the Tax Liability Amount arising from any or all of the following
(without duplication):

  

(i) Any failure by the Seller to make payment is full as may be required
under **_Section 7.1(a)_** ;

  

(ii) any failure by the Seller to make payment in full as may be required
under **_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_** ;

  

(iii) any liability of an MCH Company for unpaid Taxes (other than Taxes
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above) in respect of any tax period or
portion thereof (determined on the basis of the principles described in
**_Section 7.1(c)(i)_** ) ending on or before such MCH Companys Closing
Date;

  

(iv) the Tax Indemnification Agreement and any Tax sharing agreement not
terminated pursuant to **_Section 7.1(f)_** ; and

  

(v) any other breach by the Seller of any covenant, agreement or obligation
of the Seller under this **_Article 7_**;

        

 _provided_ , that the Seller shall have no liability therefor if and to the
extent that such Tax Liability Amount shall have been taken into account in
the computation of the Purchase Price Adjustment relating to the respective
MCH Company or its Portfolio Segment.

  

 **7.4.** ** _Indemnification by the Purchaser._**

  

The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller to the extent,
and subject to the limitations, set forth in this **_Section 7.4_** and **

would result in a Claim under this **_Article 7_** (referred to herein as a
" ** _Tax Claim_** ") ** __** for payment by one Party (the " ** _Tax
Indemnifying Party_** ") to the other Party (the " ** _Tax Indemnified
Party_** "), the Tax Indemnified Party shall notify the Tax Indemnifying
Party in writing of such fact.  Such notice shall be provided promptly, and
shall be considered to have been timely provided if made in accordance with
** _Section 12.1_** not later than the earlier of (i) 20 Business Days after
receipt by the Tax Indemnified Party (or, in the case of the Purchaser, the
relevant MCH Company) of such Tax Claim or (ii) such earlier date that is not
later than 5 Business Days prior to the date on which a response to such Tax
Claim is first required to be made to the relevant Taxing Authority; provided
that (x) a good faith failure to give such timely notification shall not
affect the rights of the Tax Indemnified Party to indemnification under this

10 Business Days prior to the date on which a response to such Tax Claim is
first required to be made to the relevant Taxing Authority and (y) the

Tax Claim in accordance with **_Section 7.5(a)_**. If the Seller elects in
writing to control such Tax Claim, the Seller shall keep the Purchaser
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Claim and
the Seller shall conduct such Tax Claim diligently and in good faith.  If
the resolution of such Tax Claim (whether by discharge,
settlement, compromise or other disposition) may reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on the Tax liability of the Purchaser or any MCH
Company that is a Transferred Interest for any tax period (or portion
thereof) after the Closing Date, then (i) such resolution shall not be
effected by the Seller without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (ii) the Seller shall consult in good faith with the Purchaser and

advance notice of meetings with the Taxing Authority, and allow the Purchaser
to participate at such meetings. If the Seller does

        

not elect to control such Tax Claim, the Purchaser shall (w) conduct the Tax
Claim diligently and in good faith, (x) keep the Seller informed regarding
the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Claim (y) if and to the
extent so requested in writing by the Seller with respect to such Tax Claim,
consult in good faith with the Seller before submitting any significant
written materials or taking other significant actions in connection with such
Tax Claim and give the Seller advance notice of meetings with the Taxing
Authority and allow the Seller to participate at such meetings and (z) not
resolve such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  

(c) If the Purchaser is the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax Claim involves
Taxes, or other payments giving rise to indemnity under **_Section 7.3_**,
for any Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to sever
the Tax Claim to (x) a Tax Claim which shall be subject to the provisions of
subsection (b) above, and (y) other Tax Claims the conduct of which shall be
outside of the scope of this **_Section 7.5_**. If the attempt to sever the
Tax Claim fails, the Purchaser shall control the conduct of such Tax Claim
pursuant under this **_Section 7.5(c)_**, and the Purchaser shall (i) keep
the Seller informed about the progress and substantive aspects of, and shall
consult with the Seller in good faith before taking any significant action in
connection with, any items in such Tax Claim for which the Seller may be
liable, (ii) consult in good faith with the Seller and provide it a
reasonable opportunity to comment, at the Sellers own expense, before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with
such Tax Claim to the extent such materials concern matters for which the
Seller may be liable, (iii) the Purchaser shall give the Seller advance
notice of meetings involving matters of the Tax Claims for which the Seller
may be liable and shall allow the Seller to participate in such meetings,
(iv) the Purchaser shall conduct the Tax Claim diligently and in good faith,
and (v) the Purchaser shall not resolve matters in such Tax Claim for which
the Seller has liability under this Article 7 without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

  

(d) If the Seller is the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax Claim involves
solely Taxes, or other payments giving rise to indemnity under **_Section
7.4,_** the Seller shall control such Tax Claim subject to the provisions set
forth in this  ** _Section 7.5(d)_**  and shall keep the Purchaser informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Claim. In
connection therewith, the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed about the
progress and substantive aspects of, and shall consult with the Purchaser in
good faith before taking any significant action in connection with, any items
in such Tax Claim for which the Purchaser may be liable, (ii) the Seller
shall consult in good faith with the Purchaser and provide it a reasonable
opportunity to comment, at Purchasers expense, before submitting any written

authority in connection with any discovery request) to the extent such
materials concern matters in the Tax Claim for which Purchaser may be liable,
(iii) the Seller shall give the Purchaser advance notice of meetings or
discussions involving matters in the Tax Claims for which the Purchaser may
be liable and shall allow the Purchaser to participate in such meetings and
discussions, (iv) the Seller shall conduct the Tax Claim diligently and in
good faith, and (v) the Seller shall not dispose of matters in such Tax Claim
for which the Purchaser has liability under **_Section 7.4_** hereof without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed

        

(e) If, after actual receipt by the Tax Indemnified Party of an amount
advanced by the Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to this **_Article 7_** , the
extent of the liability of the Tax Indemnified Party with respect to a Tax
Claim shall be established by the final judgment or decree of a court or
other tribunal or a final and binding settlement with a Taxing Authority or
other Governmental Agency having jurisdiction thereof to be less than the
amount previously advanced by the Tax Indemnifying Party, the Tax Indemnified
Party shall promptly repay to the Tax Indemnifying Party the amount of such
excess together with any interest received thereon from the applicable Taxing
Authority and any recovery of legal fees from such Taxing Authority, net of
any Taxes as are required to be paid by the Tax Indemnifying Party with
respect to such refund, interest or legal fees (calculated at the maximum
applicable statutory rate of Tax in the year of recovery without regard to
any other Tax Items).

  

(f) Each Party hereby grants (or, as appropriate, will cause the relevant MCH
Company to grant) to the other Party a binding power of attorney, and agrees
to provide further evidence of such grant as may be necessary, to permit the
other Party to act as set forth in this **_Section 7.5_** with respect to any
such Tax Claims.

  

 **7.6.** ** _Conflicts_.** In the event of a conflict between the provisions

continue for 10 calendar days after notice under this **_Section 10.1(a)_**
by either Party to the other Party; or

  

(b) at any time in connection with a Closing for one or more Portfolio
Segments, if the Purchaser has failed to make payment of all or part of the
Purchase Price on the Closing Date specified for such Closing and such
failure shall not have been remedied within one Business Day after receipt of
notice from the Seller; or

  

(c) at any time before the Closing for one or more Portfolio Segments, if a
Party has materially breached its obligations hereunder and such breach
(other than a breach of the Purchasers obligation to pay the Purchase Price
in accordance with the terms of **_Article 2_** or a breach by the Purchaser
under **_Section_** **_12.10(a)_** ) has not been cured within 30 calendar
days after notice thereof from the other Party; _provided,_ that if at the end
of such 30-day period, the breaching Party is endeavoring in good faith, and
proceeding diligently, to cure such breach, the breaching Party shall have an
additional 15 calendar days in which to effect such cure, after notice under
this **_Section 10.1(c)_** by the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party;
or

  

(d) at any time before the Closing for one or more Portfolio Segments, if
the Purchaser Security posted by way of an irrevocable letter of credit has
expired or is set to expire within 30 calendar days and the Purchaser has
not, within 20 calendar days after written notice thereof from the Seller,
replaced such letter of credit with the Purchaser Security in cash or in the
form of a substitute letter of credit in the form set forth in **_Exhibit
A-1_** , after notice under this **_Section 10.1(d)_** from the Seller to
the Purchaser, or

  

(e) if no Closing has occurred for a Portfolio Segment on or before the date
365 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, then after notice under
this **_Section 10.1(e)_** in respect of such Portfolio Segment from either
Party to the other Party;

  

then, and in any such case: (i) the obligation of the Seller to sell, and
the Purchaser to purchase, such Portfolio Segment or Portfolio Segments
(as specified by the Party entitled to give notice, above), and all
related obligations relating to Closing, Interim Periods and related matters
for such Portfolio Segment or Portfolio Segments, shall thereupon terminate
and be of no further force or effect; and (ii) if such termination shall be
in respect of the Jamaica Segment, the obligations of the Parties as to all
other Portfolio Companies that are not yet Transferred Interests shall
thereupon terminate and be of no further force or effect.  Termination
pursuant to this **_Section 10.1_** is without prejudice to the rights of
either Party in respect of a breach hereunder.

  

 **10.2.** ** _Effect of Termination_**.

  

(a) If the obligations with respect to any Portfolio Segment are validly
terminated pursuant to **_Section 10.1_** , except as set forth in
**_Sections 10.2(b)_** or **_10.2(c)_** , there will be no liability or
obligation on the part of either Party as a direct result of such
termination, without releasing or modifying any liability or obligations of
the Parties as may otherwise arise hereunder.

  

(b) If: (i) the obligations with respect to any Portfolio Segment are
validly terminated by the Seller pursuant to **_Section 10.1(b), Section
10.1(c)_** (as a result of a breach by the

        

Purchaser), ** __** or ** _Section 10.1(d)_**; and (ii) as of the date of
such termination, the Purchaser does not have any corresponding right of
termination with respect to such Portfolio Segment pursuant to **_Section
10.1_** , then the Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Seller on first demand
$30,000,000 or such lesser amount calculated in the manner set forth in
**_Section 2.7,_** in respect of the Portfolio Segment or Segments so
terminated (the " ** _Break-Up_** **_Fee_** "). To this end, the Seller shall
have the absolute right and discretion to apply the Purchaser Security to
such Break-Up Fee in accordance with **_Section 2.7(b)_**. Without
releasing or modifying any liability or obligations of the Parties as may
otherwise arise hereunder, the Break-Up Fee shall be paid to the Seller as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty and shall be the Sellers sole and
exclusive remedy against the Purchaser or any Representative or Affiliate of
the Purchaser under this Agreement or otherwise as a direct result of such
termination. The Parties recognize that the estimation of damages to the
Seller arising from such a termination of a Portfolio Segment would be
difficult to determine.

  

(c) Subject to **_Section 11.4_**  but notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, if the obligations with respect to any
Portfolio Segment are validly terminated pursuant to **_Section 10.1(b)_**
by the Purchaser as a result of a breach by the Seller, the Purchaser shall
be entitled to all rights and remedies available to it.

  

 **11.** ** INDEMNIFICATION, LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, WAIVERS, MEDIATION AND
COURT ADJUDICATION**

  

 **11.1.** ** _Indemnification_**.

  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this **_Article 11_** ,
after the Closing, the Seller agrees to indemnify and hold the Purchaser and
its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives harmless from
and against any and all Losses incurred by the Purchaser or such officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives arising out of or resulting
from any of the following:

  

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Seller in this
Agreement;

  

(ii) the breach by the Seller of, or default in the performance by the Seller
of, any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement; and

  

(iii) any Retained Liabilities;

  

 _provided_  that the provisions of this **_Section 11.1(a)_** shall not
apply as to any Claim or Claims made in respect of **_Section 4.9_** or
**_Article 7_** hereof, all of which shall be governed solely by the terms of
**_Article 7_** hereof.

  

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this **_Article 11_** ,
after the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold the Seller and
its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives harmless from
and against any and all Losses incurred by the Seller or such officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives arising out of or resulting
from any of the following:

  

(i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this
Agreement; and,

        

(ii) the breach by the Purchaser of, or default in the performance by the
Purchaser of, any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;

  

 _provided_  that the provisions of this **_Section 11.1(b)_** shall not
apply as to any Claim or Claims made in respect of **_Article 7_** hereof,
all of which shall be governed solely by the terms of **_Article
7_** hereof.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser or any of its
Representatives pursuant to this **_Article 11 _**for any breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the Seller if, prior to the Closing
Date:

  

(i) the Purchaser had actual knowledge (without any requirement of inquiry)
of such breach;

  

(ii) if the Seller had Knowledge of such breach prior to the Closing Date,
the Seller used commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach prior to
the Closing Date, even if such breach was not cured as a result of such
efforts; and

  

(iii) the Purchaser had the right to terminate this Agreement as a result, in
whole or in part, of such breach and elected not to do so.

  

For the avoidance of doubt, no Claim may be asserted by the Purchaser under
this **_Section 11.1(c)_** with respect to differences (if any) between the
Unaudited Company Financial Statements and the Audited Company Financial
Statements.

  

 **11.2.** ** _Limitations of Liability_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

  

(a) except in the case of Claims arising under Section 3.3(a)(ii), no Claim
or Claims arising out of the same facts may be asserted under Section
11.1(a)(i) or Section 11.1(b)(i) unless the Loss arising therefrom equals or
exceeds $100,000 (the " ** _Claim Threshold_** "), in which case only the
amount in excess of the Claim Threshold shall be recoverable under this
Article 11; provided, however, that the full amount of any such Loss shall be
applied in determining whether the Deductible Amount has been reached, but
shall not be included thereafter for the purpose of determining whether the
Indemnity Cap has been reached.

  

(b) if a non-breaching Party fails to provide written notice to a breaching
Party of an alleged breach of a representation or warranty in **_Articles
3_** , ** _4_** or ** _5_** within the time periods specified in Section **
_11.3_** , which notice specifies in reasonable detail the factual basis of
the alleged breach, such alleged breach shall be deemed, for all purposes,
not to be a breach of such representation or warranty;

  

(c) except in the case of Claims arising under **_Section 3.3(a)(ii)_** , **
__** the Seller and the Purchaser shall have no liability under **_Sections
11.1(a)(i) and 11.1(b)(i)_** , as applicable, unless the aggregate amount of
all Losses incurred by the Seller or the Purchaser (excluding Losses for
which Claims may not be asserted under **_Section 11.2(a)_**  above) equals
or exceeds 1.5% of the Aggregate Base Purchase Price as of the date of
determination (the " ** _Deductible Amount_** "), in which event the Seller
shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses as of such date of
determination;

        

(d) except for liability for actual fraud or breach of the Sellers
representations in **_Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a)(ii), 3.4, 4.1_** , and
**_4.2_**  (the " ** _Enumerated Sections_** ,") liability for which shall
not exceed 100% of the Base Purchase Price allocable to the relevant
Portfolio Segment, in no event shall either Partys aggregate liability in
respect of a Portfolio Segment arising out of or relating to the breach of a
representation or warranty under this Agreement, exceed 15% of the Aggregate
Base Purchase Price as of the date of determination (the " **
_Indemnity Cap_** ");

  

(e) the Parties shall have a duty to use their reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Loss as to which an indemnity applies hereunder; and,

  

(f) the Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser for any
Losses that represent the cost of repairs, replacements or improvements which
enhance the value of the repaired, replaced or improved Asset above its value
on the Closing Date.

  

 **11.3.** ** _Limited Claim Period_**.  Except for Claims involving actual
fraud, and except as otherwise provided in **_Article 7_** , no Person shall
make or bring any Claim under this Agreement relating to any Portfolio
Company subsequent to a period that is 12 months after the relevant Closing
Date for such Portfolio Company; _ provided_ , that Claims arising with
respect to the following shall survive such date until expiry of the
applicable statute of limitations:

  

(i) Claims with respect to a breach of representation or warranty under the
Enumerated Sections;

  

(ii) Claims under **_Article 7, Section 4.10_**  and **_Section 4.12_** ;

  

(iii) Claims under **_Article 6_** , to the extent performance therein is
contemplated after such Closing Date; and

  

(iv) Claims under **_Article 12_**.

  

 **11.4.** ** _Waiver of Remedies_**.

  

(a) Except in the case of actual fraud, each of the Parties hereby agrees to
limit its recourse for breach of representation or warranty by the other
Party, and not make any Claim for any Loss or other matter, under, relating
to or arising out of such breach, whether based on Contract, tort, strict
liability, other Laws or otherwise, except for (i) Claims for indemnification
pursuant to **_Article 7 or Sections 11.1(a)(i) _**or ** _11.1(b)(i)_** or
(ii) as permitted in **_Article 10_**.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
except in the case of actual fraud by a Party hereto, no Party shall be
liable under a Claim of indemnification for special, punitive, exemplary,
consequential, or indirect damages, or lost profits (provided that such
limitation with respect to lost profits shall not limit the Parties right to
recover contract damages in connection with (i) a failure to close in
violation of this Agreement or (ii) diminution in value of the shares
purchased by the Purchaser), whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Laws or otherwise, and whether or not arising from the other
Partys sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault
(the " ** _Non-reimbursable Damages_** ").

  

(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
(i) the provisions of **_Sections 6.5, 12.4_** and **_12.5_** ; or (ii)
Sellers obligation to consummate the Closing following satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in **_Article 9_** are not in each case

        

performed in accordance with their specified terms or are otherwise breached.
It is, accordingly, agreed that each Party shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of said Sections by the other Party and to
enforce specifically against such other Party the terms and provisions
thereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy at Law or in equity.

  

(d) The Purchaser unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of set-
off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar rights that it has or may have
with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price or any other payments to be
made by the Purchaser to the Seller under this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the Transaction.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Representative or Affiliate of the Seller shall have any personal liability
to the Purchaser or any other Person as a result of the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller contained
herein, and no Representative or Affiliate of the Purchaser shall have any
personal liability to the Seller or any other Person as a result of the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained herein.

  

 **11.5.** ** _Dispute Resolution_**.

  

(a) The Parties agree that, if any dispute, other than a dispute under
**_Section 2.2(d)_** , arises between the Parties out of or relating to this
Agreement (a " ** _Dispute_** "), then the claiming Party shall deliver to
the other Party a reasonably detailed written notice describing the basis for
the Dispute and such Partys Claims and also identifying members of senior
management of such Party that are prepared to meet to attempt to resolve such
Dispute and their contact information. Promptly upon receipt of such written
notice, the other Party shall appoint one or more members of its senior
management to meet to attempt to resolve such Dispute, and such Party shall
provide written notice identifying such members of senior management and
their contact information. Both Parties shall cause their respective
appointed members of senior management to meet to attempt to resolve the
Dispute within 60 calendar days (the " ** _Initial Dispute Resolution
Period_** ") after the initial written notice of such Dispute was delivered.
Each Partys rights under this Agreement shall not be prejudiced during the
period in which the Parties are attempting to resolve a Dispute.

  

(b) If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through the procedures
described in **_Section 11.5(a)_**  within the Initial Dispute Resolution
Period, then the Parties shall be permitted to bring legal action to enforce
their rights under this Agreement in accordance with **_Section 12.14_**.

  

 **11.6.** ** _Procedure for Indemnification  Third-Party Claims_**.

  

(a) If any Party shall claim indemnification hereunder arising from any Claim
of a third party, the Party seeking indemnification (the " ** _Indemnified
Party_** ") shall notify the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
** _Indemnifying Party_** ") in writing of the basis for such Claim setting
forth the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail. The failure of
the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to
the extent that the defense of such Claim is prejudiced by the failure to
give such notice.

  

(b) If any proceeding is brought by a third party against an Indemnified
Party and the Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to **_Section 11.6(a)_** , the

        

Indemnifying Party shall, unless the Claim involves Taxes, be entitled to
participate in such proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume
the defense of such proceeding, if: (i) the Indemnifying Party provides
written notice to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party intends
to undertake such defense; (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense
of the third-party Claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; and (iii) if the Indemnifying Party is
a party to the proceeding, either Party has not determined in good faith that
joint representation would be materially inappropriate because of a conflict
of interest. The Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the
right to employ separate counsel (who may be selected by the Indemnified
Party in its sole discretion) in any such action and to participate in the
defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by
the Indemnified Party for its own account. The Indemnified Party shall fully
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense or
compromise of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
proceeding, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent unless (A) there
is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other Claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Party or the MCH Companies; (B) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party;
and (C) such compromise or settlement contains as an unconditional term
thereof the delivery by such third party to the Indemnified Party of a
written release from all liability in respect of such third partys Claim.

  

(c) If: (i) notice in writing is given to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of any third-party legal proceeding and the Indemnifying Party
does not, within ten calendar days after written notice is given by the
Indemnified Party, give notice in writing to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such legal proceeding; (ii) any of the
conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of **_Section 11.6(b)_**
above become unsatisfied; or (iii) an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a legal proceeding may
adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages for which it
would be entitled to indemnification from the Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall (upon notice in writing to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Claim; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs of defending against the third-
party Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and
the Indemnifying Party shall remain responsible for any indemnifiable
amounts arising from or related to such third-party Claim to the fullest
extent provided in this **_Article 11_**. The Indemnifying Party may elect
to participate in such legal proceedings, negotiations or defense at any time
at its own expense.

 **12.2.** ** ****_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement supersedes all
prior discussions and agreements between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the sole and entire agreement between the
Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

 **12.3.** ** ****_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, whether or not the Transaction contemplated hereby is
consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in
anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 **12.4.** ** ****_Public Announcements_**. Except as may be required by Law
or any applicable stock exchange rules, the Purchaser will not issue or make,
and will cause the MCH Companies, and to the extent practicable, the
Designated Companies, not to issue or make, any press releases or other
public disclosures concerning this Agreement or the Transaction contemplated
hereby without first obtaining consent from the Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Subject to the
foregoing provisions of this **_Section 12.4_** , the Parties agree and
acknowledge that each of them intends to issue separately a press release on
the date of this Agreement and on each Closing Date.

        

 **12.5.** ** ****_Confidential Information_**.

  

(a) For two years from and after the final Closing Date, the Seller
shall cause any data or information received at any time by the Seller,
its Affiliates or their Representatives from the Purchaser, its Affiliates or
their Representatives and any data or information regarding the Transferred
Interests, their business, operations, financial conditions or prospects, to
be maintained by the Seller, its Affiliates and their Representatives in
confidence, not to be utilized for any purpose (except, pending each Closing,
to prepare therefor) and not to be disclosed for any purpose.

  

(b) With respect to all data and information, from the date hereof until the
final Closing (or, if the obligations with respect to all remaining Closings
shall be earlier terminated, then with respect to all data and information
until two years after the date of such termination), the Purchaser shall
cause any such data or information received at any time by the Purchaser, its
Affiliates or their Representatives from the Seller, its Affiliates or their
Representatives and any such data or information regarding the
Portfolio Companies, their business, operations, financial conditions or
prospects, to be maintained by the Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
Representatives in confidence, not to be utilized for any purposes (except
pending each Closing, to prepare therefor) and not to be disclosed for any
purpose.

  

(c) With respect to the obligations under **_Sections 12.5(a)_** and **
_12.5(b)_** , in the event that any Person subject to confidentiality
thereunder is requested or required (in each case by oral question or request
for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such
information, either Party, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Person to notify the Parties to whom such confidential
information relates promptly of such request or requirement so that such
Parties may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this **_Section 12.5_**. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Person, on the advice of
counsel in writing, is compelled to disclose any such information or else
stand liable for contempt, such Person may disclose such information;
_provided_ , that the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, shall cause
such disclosing Person to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such portion of such information required to be disclosed.

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality obligations set forth
in this **_Section 12.5_** shall not apply to any disclosure of information:

  

(i) which at the time of disclosure is already in the public domain through
no fault of the applicable Parties, their Affiliates or their respective
Representatives;

  

(ii) which after disclosure becomes part of the public domain through no
act or fault of the applicable Parties or their Affiliates or their
respective Representatives;

  

(iii) if such information subsequently becomes known to the
applicable Parties or their Affiliates or their respective Representatives
through no breach of their obligations hereunder;

  

(iv) which is independently developed by the applicable Parties or their
Affiliates through no breach of their obligations hereunder;

        

(v) required by Law or stock exchange rules; _provided_ , that the applicable
Parties shall use, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates, if any, to
use, commercially reasonable efforts to give the other Parties prior notice
of such disclosure in sufficient time to enable such other Parties to protect
any such information; or

  

(vi) regarding the U.S. federal income Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Transaction contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the
Parties relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure.

  

 **12.6.** ** ****_Disclosure_**. The Seller may, at its option, include in
the Schedules items that are not material or required to be disclosed in
order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any
references to Dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or
representation that such items are material or required to be disclosed, to
establish any standard of materiality, or to define further the meaning of
such terms for purposes of this Agreement. Information disclosed in
**_Attachment I_** and the Schedules in such a way as to make its relevance
to the disclosure required elsewhere in **_Attachment I_** or the Schedules
reasonably apparent shall constitute a disclosure with respect to such other
Attachment or Schedule. In accordance with **_Section 6.14_** , the Seller
may amend, modify or supplement **_Attachment I_** and the Schedules for
each Portfolio Company prior to the Closing relating thereto by giving
written notice to the Purchaser thereof, and any such amendments,
modifications and supplements shall be effective for all purposes other than
in respect of the Sellers liability (if any) for breach of a representation
or warranty in respect of which the Purchaser has terminated this Agreement
pursuant to **_Section 10.1(b)_**  (including for the purposes of
indemnification under **_Article 11_** ); _provided_ , that any such
amendments shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether the
conditions to such Closing contained in **_Section 8.1_** have been
satisfied.

  

 **12.7.** ** ****_Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but
no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument
duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition.
No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one
or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same
or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will
be cumulative and not alternative.

  

 **12.8.** ** ****_Amendment_**. Except as set forth in **_Section 12.6_** ,
this Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only by a written
instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each Party.

  

 **12.9.** ** ****_No Third Party Beneficiary_**. The terms and provisions of
this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of
the Parties to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

  

 **12.10.** ** ****_Assignment; Binding Effect_**.

  

(a) Except to an Affiliate thereof, the Purchaser may not assign any of
its rights or obligations hereunder to any other Person without the Sellers
prior written consent, and any attempt to do so in contravention of this
**_Section 12.10(a)_** will be void; _provided, however_ , that the
Purchaser may collaterally assign any right, interest or obligation hereunder
to one or more lenders that are providing financing in connection with the
Transaction.

        

(b) Subject to this **_Section 12.10_** , this Agreement is binding upon,
inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to have granted to
the Purchaser any right or interest in, or Lien upon, any Transferred Stock
prior to the Closing.

  

 **12.11.** ** ****_Headings_**. The headings used in this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit
the provisions hereof.

  

 **12.12.** ** ****_Invalid Provisions_**. If any provision of this Agreement
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future
Law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision will be
fully severable, this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force

this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms
to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision to effect the explicit
intent of the Parties as may be possible.
