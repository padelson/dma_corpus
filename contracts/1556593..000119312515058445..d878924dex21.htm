iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February
22, 2015, by and among Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd., a Cayman Islands
exempted company (the " _Company_ "), New Residential Investment Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Hexagon Merger Sub, Ltd., a
Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ ").

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to effect the Merger,
pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, with
the Company surviving the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Companies Law (2013
Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the " _Cayman Companies Law_ "), the Company
Memorandum and the Company Articles, and each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall be converted into the right
to receive $18.25 in cash;

WHEREAS, the Company Board, the Parent Board and the Merger Sub Board each
have approved this Agreement, determined that the terms of this Agreement are
in the best interests of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and
their respective shareholders, and declared the advisability of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the Merger Sub Board have recommended adoption
and approval of this Agreement by their respective shareholders; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Cayman Companies Law, on
the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving company in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four
Times Square, New York, New York 10036 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a
date to be specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than
the second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
in writing between the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



1 Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute a plan of merger
(the " _Cayman Plan of Merger_ ") substantially in the form contained in
Appendix 1 hereto and shall file the Cayman Plan of Merger and other documents
required to effect the Merger pursuant to the Cayman Companies Law with the
Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands as provided in section 233 of the
Cayman Companies Law on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective at
the time when the Cayman Plan of Merger has been registered by the Registrar
of Companies of the Cayman Islands or such later time as Merger Sub and the
Company may agree and specify in the Cayman Plan of Merger in accordance with
the Cayman Companies Law (the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
Cayman Companies Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to
and assume all the rights, property of every description, including choses in
action, and the business, undertaking, goodwill benefits, immunities and
privileges, mortgages, charges or security interests and all contracts,
obligations, claims, debts and liabilities of Merger Sub and the Company in
accordance with the Cayman Companies Law.

 

ARTICLE II

_Effect on the Share Capital of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of Company
Shares_

Section 2.01 _Effect on Share Capital_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any ordinary shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Shares_ ") or any ordinary shares, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Shares_ ") or any other Person:

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Shares_. Each Merger Sub Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) fully paid and nonassessable ordinary share, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and privileges
as the shares so converted. From and after the Effective Time, any
certificates evidencing Merger Sub Shares shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent the number of shares of the Surviving Company into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares; Conversion of
Subsidiary-Owned Shares_.

(i) Each Company Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and
each Company Share that is owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist or have any rights with
respect thereto, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



2 (ii) Each Company Share that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub shall be converted into
such number of shares of the Surviving Company such that the ownership
percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company immediately
following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such
Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to _Sections 2.02_ and _2.03_ ,
each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted into shares of the
Surviving Company in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $18.25 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such Company Shares,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist and the register of members of the Company
will be amended accordingly and each holder of a Company Share that is in
registered form shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (subject to
compliance with _Section 5.01_) the outstanding Company Shares shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the
number of Company Shares will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. As provided in _Section 2.02(h)_, the right of
any holder of a Company Share to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
subject to and reduced by the amount of any required withholding under
applicable Tax Law.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Company Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Company Shares, for payment in accordance with this _Article II_ through
the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration. All such
cash deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_."

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Company Shares a form of letter of transmittal (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall be in such customary form and have
such other customary provisions (including customary provisions with respect
to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in registered
form) as Parent may specify subject to the Companys reasonable approval),
together with instructions thereto.

 



3 (c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon the
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into
which such Company Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered
in the register of members of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be
paid to a transferee if the proper evidence of such transfer is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02(c)_,
each Company Share shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holders of Company Shares are entitled to receive in
respect of such shares pursuant to this _Section 2.02(c)_. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Company Shares held in registered form.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any Company Shares shall be deemed to have been issued and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From
and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the register of members of the Surviving Company of Company
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Company Shares held in registered form are
presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any and all interest and other proceeds received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company
Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_  shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for two (2)
years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which the Payment Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of,
any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in
the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of,
Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund
shall diminish the rights of any of the Companys shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein.

 



4 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law;  _provided_ that Parent shall notify the
Company of any amounts that Parent reasonably believes are required to be
deducted and withheld from the consideration payable to the holders of the
Company Shares ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date (or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter), and the parties hereto shall cooperate in
good faith to attempt to minimize any such amounts required to be deducted and
withheld. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

 

Section 2.03 _Dissenters  Rights_. No Person who has validly exercised such
Persons dissenting rights pursuant to section 238 of the Cayman Companies
Law shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.01(c)_ with respect to Company Shares owned by such Person ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn its dissent or lost such Persons dissenting rights under the Cayman
Companies Law. If a holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws its
dissent or loses its dissenting rights pursuant to section 238 of the Cayman
Companies Law with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Company Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares. Each Dissenting Share shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time and holders of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to their Company Shares and
shall instead be entitled to receive only the payment resulting from the
procedure in section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law with respect to their
shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all Dissenting Shares held by
shareholders who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their dissenting
rights under the Cayman Companies Law shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and
shall be deemed to have been cancelled in consideration for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, in the manner provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, and Parent
shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent any
additional funds necessary to pay in full the Merger Consideration so due and
payable to such shareholders. The Company shall promptly give Parent (i)
copies of notices of objection, notices of dissent, any written demands
for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company
relating to Company shareholders rights of dissent and (ii) the opportunity
to direct or approve all offers, negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any demand for appraisal under the Cayman Companies Law. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. In the event
that any written notices of objection to the Merger are served by any
shareholders of the Company pursuant to section 238(2) of the Cayman
Companies Law, the Company shall serve written notice of the authorization of
the Merger on such shareholders pursuant to section 238(4) of the Cayman
Companies Law within twenty (20) days of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval at the Company Shareholders Meeting.

 



5 ARTICLE III

 

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

 

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this _Article III_ are true and
correct except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to
the Company at or before the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub
of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "). The Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to
the numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article III_ , and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify any other section in
this  _Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the
text of such disclosures that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to
such other section.

 

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all corporate power and
authority required to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to perform each
of its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified
or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company,
prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of (a) the
certificate of incorporation of Parent in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and the by-laws of Parent in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (b) the constituent documents of Merger Sub.

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver the Cayman Plan of Merger and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby. The Parent Board has adopted resolutions,
by unanimous vote of the directors present at a meeting duly called at which a
quorum of directors of Parent was present, (i) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and (ii) determining that entering
into this Agreement is in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders.
As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended
or withdrawn. The Merger Sub Board has unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Cayman Plan of Merger, (ii) determining that the terms of this Agreement and
the Cayman Plan of Merger are in the best interests of Merger Sub and Parent,
as its sole shareholder, (iii) declaring this Agreement advisable and (iv)
recommending that Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, adopt this
Agreement and the Cayman Plan of Merger and directing that this Agreement be
submitted to Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, for adoption. As of
the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or
withdrawn. Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this
Agreement and the Cayman Plan of Merger. No other corporate action on the part

 



6  of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as
applicable, this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing of the
Cayman Plan of Merger and other documents required to effect the Merger
pursuant to the Cayman Companies Law). Each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

_Section 4.05_ and _Section 4.23_), excluding any disclosures in the Filed

the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power
or authority, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Company

nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make
such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed has not had, individually or in the

in, the Company, other than the issuance of Company Shares upon the exercise
of Company Share Options outstanding at the close of business on February 13,
2015 and in accordance with their terms in effect at such time. Except as set

the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued by or
other obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are linked in
any way to the price of any class of Company share capital or any shares of

Subsidiary or any part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any

immediately preceding sentence. With respect to Company Share Options, (1)
each grant of a Company Share Option was duly authorized on the date on which
the grant of such Company Share Option was by its terms to be effective (the
" _Grant Date_ ") for such option by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted
and authorized committee or subcommittee thereof), and (2) the per share
exercise price of each Company Share Option was at least equal to the fair
market value of a Company Shares on the applicable Grant Date. There are no
debentures, bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of the Company having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which the Companys shareholders may vote ("
_Company Voting Debt_ "). None of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of
any share capital or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the
Company. None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to
any agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or
nominate any director of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(c) _Section 4.03(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of February 13, 2015, of each outstanding Company Share
Option, including the number of Company Shares issuable upon exercise of such

Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, employees not

cause, its and the Company Subsidiaries accountants, consultants, legal

with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries respective directors, officers,
employees, " _Representatives_ " (for the avoidance of doubt, which definition
may be applied to any other Person as if such Person were the Company)) not
to, and shall not publicly announce any intention to, directly or indirectly:
(A) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
Alternative Proposal or any inquiry in respect thereof, (B) furnish
information to or afford access to the business, employees, officers,
contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to any Person or any Persons representatives in
connection with any Alternative Proposal or inquiry in respect thereof, (C)
enter into, continue or maintain discussions or negotiations with any Person
or any Persons representatives with respect to any Alternative Proposal or
inquiry in respect thereof, (D) otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in or knowingly facilitate any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person or Group any

or agreement in principle or any other agreement providing for, or related
to, any Alternative Proposal (except for Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements

foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any Representative of the Company
takes any action, which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of
this _Section 5.03(a)_, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of
this  _Section 5.03(a)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.03(a)_, if the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives a bona fide unsolicited, written Alternative Proposal
by any Person or Group at any time after the date of this Agreement, but prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting, and if the receipt of such Alternative
Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.03_, the Company and
its Representatives may, prior to (but not after) the Company Shareholders
Meeting, take the actions set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) of this
_Section 5.03(b)_ if and to the extent prior to taking such actions, and only
for so long as, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined,
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, subject to
the prior execution by such Person of (and the Company and/or Company
Subsidiaries may enter into) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (for the
avoidance of doubt, irrespective of whether such

 



33  Person was previously party to a confidentiality agreement with the Company
or any Company Subsidiary): (i) furnish non-public information to and afford
access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets,
books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to any Person in
response to such Alternative Proposal, and (ii) enter into discussions and
negotiations with, such Person or Group with respect to such written
Alternative Proposal.

(c) Promptly (but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours) following
receipt by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or its or their
respective Representatives of any Alternative Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to
result in any Alternative Proposal, the Company shall advise Parent in
writing of the receipt of such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and
the terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry
(including, in each case, the identity of the Person or Group making any such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry), and the Company shall as promptly
as practicable provide to Parent (i) a copy of such Alternative Proposal,
request or inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written summary of the material
terms of such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, if oral and, in either
case, any other documents provided in connection therewith. The Company agrees
that it shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that may be provided (pursuant to
_Section 5.03(b)_) to any other Person or Group in connection with any
Alternative Proposal that has not previously been provided to Parent. In
addition, the Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable with
notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep
Parent informed on a current basis in all material respects of all
communications regarding (including amendments or proposed amendments to)
such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry. None of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
agreement that would prohibit them from providing any of the foregoing
information to Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company Board may (i) (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation
or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or
release inconsistent with the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include, or
publicly propose to fail to include, the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (C) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, an Alternative Proposal, (D) if a
tender offer or exchange offer for share capital of the Company that
constitutes an Alternative Proposal is commenced, fail to publicly recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company
shareholders (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with
respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its
shareholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer, provided that a customary
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be prohibited), within ten (10)
Business Days after commencement or (E) (1) following the public disclosure or
public announcement of an Alternative Proposal (other than a tender offer or
exchange offer as contemplated in clause (D)) and at the request in writing
by Parent or (2) at any other time at the request in writing by Parent
following the occurrence of any event or development as a result of which
Parent reasonably determines such reaffirmation is 

 



34  appropriate, in each case, fail to reaffirm publicly the Company
Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after Parent requests in writing
that the Company Recommendation be reaffirmed publicly (provided that Parent
shall be entitled to make such a written request only once for each
Alternative Proposal and once for each increase in price or other material
change in terms of such Alternative Proposal, and twice otherwise) (any
of the foregoing being an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, that a bona fide written
Alternative Proposal received by the Company in compliance with this _Section
5.03_ and that has not been withdrawn is a Superior Proposal (after taking
into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this 
_Section 5.03(d)_) (a " _Superior Proposal Determination_ "), terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ to enter into a definitive written
agreement providing for such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement (a " _Superior Proposal Agreement_ "), in each
case with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), if and only if, (x)
the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to take such action as contemplated in clause (ii) above would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (y) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with this _Section 5.03_ and (z) with respect to an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Board determines to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change either (I) in response to an Intervening Event or (II)
in connection with a Superior Proposal Determination and the Companys related
entry into a Superior Proposal Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) above;
_provided_ that the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or, in the case of entering into a Superior Proposal Agreement,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_, unless:

 

(i) the Company has complied in all material respects with this _Section
5.03_;

 

(ii) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4)
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intent to take such
action, which notice shall advise Parent of the circumstances giving rise to
the Intervening Event (if any) with respect to the Adverse Recommendation
Change, and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that the Company Board has
received such Superior Proposal and made a Superior Proposal Determination
with respect to such Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of such
Superior Proposal, a copy of the proposed Superior Proposal Agreement with,
and the identity of, the party making the Superior Proposal and all other
material documents related to such Superior Proposal that were provided to the
Company or its Representatives (including any financing commitments with
respect to such Superior Proposal that were provided to the Company or its
Representatives);

(iii) during the Notice Period, the Company has and has caused its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
judgment of the

 



35  Company Board) a Superior Proposal or in case of an Intervening Event, the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change (in the judgment of the
Company Board) would no longer be inconsistent with the directors exercise
of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(iv) after the completion of the Notice Period, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations
and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed
to by Parent during the Notice Period, if any, that, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors such Superior Proposal (in the judgment of the Company
Board) remains a Superior Proposal or in cases of an Intervening Event,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change (in the judgment of the Company Board)
would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
(other than immaterial revisions that do not relate to the financial
terms, consideration or conditionality of the Superior Proposal), the Company
shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.03(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence,
references to the four (4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two (2) Business Day period (and the notice period shall be
extended accordingly and in no event shall be shortened).

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall direct its
and their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any offer or proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to result in, an Alternative
Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any Person (other than Parent) that has,
within the one (1) year period prior to the date of this Agreement, made or
indicated an intention to make an Alternative Proposal and (iii) not waive or
amend any "standstill" provision or provisions of similar effect to which it
is a party or of which it is a beneficiary and shall enforce any such
provisions, provided that amendments to such provisions to allow private
proposals to the Company Board that would not reasonably be expected to
require the Company to make a public announcement in respect thereof are
permitted to the extent that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law (after
consultation with outside legal counsel).

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from
making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Company Board
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
accordance with _Section 5.03(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually
accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
(including reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) shall not be deemed
an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



36 (g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to, whether in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other

 _Additional Agreements_

 

Section 6.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders
Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement or, if the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2014 has not been filed by such date, no later than three (3)
Business Days after the filing of such Form 10-K, and in no event later than
twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), the Company
shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC
a proxy statement to be sent to the Companys shareholders relating to the
Company Shareholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto and the letter to shareholders, notice of meeting, and form of proxy
and any other document incorporated or related therein, the "
_Proxy Statement_ "). Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent
and its Affiliates to the Company as is customarily included in a proxy
statement prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by
this Agreement or as otherwise requested by the SEC or required by Law, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, and the
Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by the
Company to be included therein that is customarily included in a proxy
statement prepared in connection with transactions

 



38  of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise requested by the
SEC or required by Law. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the
receipt of any written or oral comments from the SEC or any written or oral
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and to cause the SEC as promptly as practicable to clear the final
Proxy Statement for mailing to its shareholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (A) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement or response (including the proposed
filed version of the Proxy Statement or response) and (B) shall include in
such filing of the Proxy Statement or response all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent.

(b) If prior to the Effective Time any change occurs with respect to
information supplied by Parent expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement,
which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such event, and
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, and as required
by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Companys shareholders. Nothing in this _Section 6.01(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

 

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to any
information in the Proxy Statement (other than the information contemplated by
_Section 6.01(b)_), which is required to be described in an amendment of, or
a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent of such event, and the Company shall as promptly as practicable file
any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement with the SEC and,
as required by Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to the Companys shareholders. Nothing in this _Section
6.01(c)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 6.01(a)_.

 

(d) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the SEC clears the
Proxy Statement (but in any event within twenty-five (25) Business Days
thereafter), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting (with the record date and meeting date to be selected
after reasonable consultation with Parent) for the sole purpose of (i)
seeking the Company Shareholder Approval; and (ii) in accordance with Section
14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder,
seeking advisory approval of a proposal to the Companys shareholders for
a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become
payable to the Companys named executive officers in connection with the
completion of the Merger. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders and
to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting, as soon as practicable after the SEC
clears the Proxy Statement and (ii) subject to _Section 5.03(d)_, solicit
the Company Shareholder Approval (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and
its Representatives shall have the right to solicit proxies in favor

 



39  of the Company Shareholder Approval for such Company Shareholders Meeting
called by the Company in the event that there is an Adverse Recommendation
Change and in any other event with the prior written consent of the Company
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)). The
Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that
they give the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ ")
and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, in each case,
except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change in compliance with _Section 5.03(d)_. The Company
agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms
prior thereto, its obligations to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting
pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Alternative Proposal or by the making of any Adverse Recommendation Change by
the Company Board. With the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), prior to the date for
which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company may (on not
more than one (1) occasion) change, postpone or adjourn the date for which the
Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, or change the record date for the
Company Shareholders Meeting, _provided_ , that the Company in good faith
believes that such change, postponement or adjournment would reasonably be
expected to increase the likelihood of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval. If, on the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of votes to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval or to obtain
a quorum for the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent may cause the Company
to, and the Company (with the prior written consent of Parent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) may postpone or adjourn the
Company Shareholders Meeting for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, and
in no event past the End Date, in order to seek to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval.

 

(e) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, in
accordance with the Cayman Companies Law, take all actions reasonably
necessary to postpone its annual general meeting of shareholders with a view
to convening such meeting following the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford
to Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access, upon
reasonable advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel (including in order to allow Parent to evaluate such personnel) and
records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not publicly
available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities laws or commission actions, (b) copies of each
"Determination Date Administrator Report" delivered in connection with HSART
or HSART II and (c) all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (in each case, in a manner so
as to not unreasonably interfere in any material respect with the normal
business operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit such access or
make such disclosure, to the extent it determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that such disclosure or access would

 



40  reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any confidentiality
agreement or other Contract with a third party ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party to such access or disclosure at Parents prior written request and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay any
fee, penalty or other consideration to any such third party to obtain their
consent), (ii) result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), or (iii) violate any
Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate
Law). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the proviso to
the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general
nature of what is being withheld. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any
access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ to
the extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation
where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of January 30, 2015, between Parent and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

Section 6.03 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
preparing as promptly as practicable all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings, ruling requests, and other documents and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all Consents necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Governmental Approvals_
"), (ii) as promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain all such Governmental Approvals, (iii) the obtaining of all other
necessary Consents from third parties, and (iv) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that (x) no party shall be required
to pay (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not pay or agree to pay
without the prior written consent of Parent) any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any Consent required for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract and (y)
the consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any amendment or
modification to any Contract in connection with obtaining any such Consent
that is adverse in any material respect to Parent or the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and complete filing, if
required by Law, of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, (B) make all other required filings
pursuant to other Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as reasonably promptly as practicable and (C) take or
agree to take any actions reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions

 



41  contemplated by this Agreement, including making divestitures of the
Parents or the Companys assets or businesses and agreeing to any other
restrictions on the businesses of either Parent or the Company, subject to
the limitations in _Section 6.03(c)_ of this Agreement. Except with the prior
written consent of the other party, each party hereto agrees not to enter into
any agreement with the FTC or the DOJ that would reasonably be expected to
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent and the Company shall supply as reasonably promptly as practicable any
additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and use its reasonable best efforts to
take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other Regulatory Law as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the actions
referenced in _Section 6.03(a)_ to obtain all Governmental Approvals for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any communication, filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or other Governmental Entity and of
any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting, conference,
or material telephone call with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party and/or its counsel
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, conferences, and
telephone calls; and (iv) permit the other party and/or its counsel to review
in advance any submission, filing or communication (and documents submitted
therewith) intended to be given by it to the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity; _provided_ that materials may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be
provided to the other under this _Section 6.03(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel
Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Sections 6.03(a)_ and _6.03(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall
take any and all steps not prohibited by Law to (i) avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the End Date, including
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the FTC,
the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party; and
(ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any

 



42  Regulatory Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later than
the End Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything else
in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be required to (and the Company
shall not without Parents prior written consent) take or commit to any
actions except as would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse
to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the commencement, or to the
Knowledge of such party, the threatened commencement of any Transaction
Litigation, (ii) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure to occur has resulted in or would reasonably be expected
to result in the failure to satisfy or be able to satisfy any of the
conditions specified in _Article VII_ , and such written notice shall specify
the condition which has failed or will fail to be satisfied, (iii) any written
notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and (iv) any written notice from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to

to this _Section 6.03(d),_ nor any knowledge that a Party or its Affiliates
may have acquired, nor could have acquired (in each case, whether before or
after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date), nor any investigation
or diligence by a Party or its Affiliates, shall limit or otherwise affect the
rights of any party or remedies available thereto.

 

Section 6.04 _Share Options_. Each Company Share Option that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into the
right of the holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company Share Option
immediately prior to such cancellation and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share of such Company
Share Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Option
Cash Payment_ "), and as of the Effective Time each holder of such a Company
Share Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Option Cash Payment (it being understood that each
Company Share Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time that has an exercise price equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without
consideration therefor). The Option Cash Payment shall be made promptly (and
in any event within five (5) Business Days) following the Closing. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company will take such actions, including obtaining
written consents of the holders of Company Share Options and adopting such
resolutions as may be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
_Section 6.04_.

 

Section 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws
(or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or

 



43  other similar agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Company agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of
this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_
"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees
and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company Indemnified Party
of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
Cayman Companies Law or the Articles of Association or the Memorandum of
Association of the Surviving Company, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled
to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company and such Company Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with each other in the defense of any such matter.

(b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.05_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(true and correct copies of which that are in effect as of the date of this
Agreement have been made available to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement) or provide substitute policies for the Company and its current and
former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and
officers insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in either
case, of not less than the coverage existing as of the Closing Date and having
other terms substantially equivalent to the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage maintained by
the Company as of the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event shall the Surviving Company be required to pay with

 



44  respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more
than 150% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company
prior to the Closing Date (which amount is set forth in _Section 5.01(k)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter) (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the
Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section
6.05_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years
within such six (6) year period for an aggregate annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of
such insurance, prior to the Closing Date Parent may, at its option
(following reasonable consultation with the Company), purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability
insurance policy for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage maintained by the Company as of the Closing Date, such tail to
provide coverage in an amount not less than such coverage and to have other
terms substantially equivalent to the directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage maintained by
the Company as of the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no
event shall the cost of any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. In the
event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the Surviving Company shall
cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
6.05(c)_. The Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full force and
effect during the period of insurance, and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
insurance indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise.

 

Section 6.06 _Transaction Litigation; Other Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense and any settlement or compromise of any litigation, suit, action or
other proceedings by any shareholder of the Company (on its own behalf or on
behalf of the Company) against the Company, any Company Subsidiary and/or any
of their respective officers or directors relating to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_
"), (b) keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any Transaction Litigation
and (c) reasonably consult with Parent regarding the defense and any
settlement or compromise of any Transaction Litigation and reasonably consider
Parents views with respect to any Transaction Litigation.

 

(b) The Company shall (a) give prompt written notice to Parent of any material
written communications (and shall deliver copies thereof) received from, or
delivered to, any shareholders of the Company or any Related Person (in each
case, other than any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) or the Companys auditors or any Governmental Entity
(subject to _Sections 6.01_ and _6.03_ ) and (b) reasonably consult with
Parent in connection with the foregoing.

 



45 Section 6.07 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to Company Shares) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule
16b3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Alternative
Proposal or Superior Proposal in each case in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement, or any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude,
after consultation with legal counsel, is required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system (in which case the
disclosing party shall consult with the other party in advance of such
disclosure to the extent practicable under the circumstances). The Company
and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this  _Section 6.08_ shall
limit the ability of any party hereto to make additional disclosures that are
consistent in all but de minimis respects with the prior public disclosures
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.09 _Employment and Company Benefits_. Except as provided in
_Section 6.09_ of the Company Disclosure Letter:

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (or if shorter,
during the period of employment), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, provide each employee of the Company and any Company Subsidiary
who is employed as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (each, a "
_Company Employee_ "), with (i) a base salary and annual target cash bonus
opportunity that are at least equal to the base salary and annual target cash
bonus opportunity provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the

all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are
consummated.

 

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $45,400,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") if:

 

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.01(f)_ or _Section
8.01(g)_;

 



54 (ii) (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been made to the Company prior to
the termination of this Agreement or shall have been publicly disclosed or
announced prior to the termination of this Agreement; (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_, _8.01(b)(iii)_ or 
_8.01(e)_ ; and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company
enters into a definitive Contract to consummate an Alternative Proposal or an
Alternative Proposal is consummated (in each case, whether or not
such Alternative Proposal was the same Alternative Proposal referred to in
clause (A)); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.03(a)(ii)_, the references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition
of "Alternative Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to fifty percent
(50%).

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.03(a)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ or  _Section 8.01(g)_ or simultaneously with
such termination, in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_
(and any purported termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ shall be void
and of no force and effect unless and until the Company shall have made such
payment) and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the first to occur of the events referred to in clause
(ii)(C) above.

 

In addition to the foregoing, in the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_, then the Company shall promptly, but in
no event later than three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay Parent
(or one or more of its designees) the documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and
the Financing and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby up
to a maximum amount of $7.0 million, by wire transfer of same-day funds, which
amount shall be credited against any Termination Fee that may become payable
to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 8.03(a)_.

(b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.03(a)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to  _Section 8.03(a)_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in a
Judgment in its favor for such payment, the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest on the
amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest
rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins
accruing. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.03_ to the contrary, in the
event that counsel or independent accountants for Parent determine that there
exists a material risk that any amounts due to Parent under _Section 8.03(a)_
or _(b)_ would be treated as Nonqualifying Income upon the payment of such
amounts to Parent, the amount paid to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_
or _(b)_ in any tax year shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be paid
to Parent in such year without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements for such year, determined as if the payment of such amount were
Nonqualifying Income as determined by such counsel or independent accountants
to Parent. If the amount payable for any tax year under the preceding sentence
is less than the amount which the Company would otherwise be obligated to pay
to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ or _(b)_ (the " _Fee/Expense_

 



55   _Amount_ "), then: (1) the Company shall place the Fee/Expense Amount into
an escrow account (the " _Fee/Expense Escrow Account_ ") using an escrow agent
and agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall not release any
portion thereof to Parent, and Parent shall not be entitled to any such
amount, unless and until Parent delivers to the Company, at the sole option of
Parent, (i) an opinion (a " _Fee/Expense Amount Tax Opinion_ ") of Parents
tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would
not constitute Nonqualifying Income, (ii) a letter (a " _Fee/Expense Amount
Accountant s Letter_") from Parents independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, or (iii)
a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to Parent indicating that the
receipt of any Fee/Expense Amount hereunder will not cause Parent to fail to
satisfy the REIT Requirements (a " _REIT Qualification Ruling_ " and,
collectively with a Fee/Expense Amount Tax Opinion and a Fee/Expense Amount
Accountants Letter, a " _Release Document_ "); and (2) pending the delivery
of a Release Document by Parent to the Company, Parent shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to borrow the Fee/Expense Amount from the Escrow
Account pursuant to a loan agreement (a " _Fee/Expense Loan Agreement_ ")
reasonably acceptable to Parent that (i) requires the Company to lend Parent
immediately available cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Fee/Expense
Amount (a " _Fee/Expense Loan_ "), and (ii) provides for (A) a commercially
reasonable interest rate and commercially reasonable covenants, taking into
account the credit standing and profile of Parent or any guarantor of Parent,
including Parent, at the time of such Loan, and (B) a fifteen (15) year
maturity with no periodic amortization.

 

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
Companys shareholders without the further approval of such shareholders, and
(ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be
submitted to be approved by the Companys shareholders unless required by Law.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with
any covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the
