and complete copies of all reports or registration  statements  filed by it with
the SEC since  January 1, 2001,  all in the form so filed (all of the  foregoing
being collectively  referred to as the "SEC Documents").  As of their respective
filing dates or as of the date of the last  amendment  therof,  if amended after
filing and prior to the date hereof,  the SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act as the
case may be, and none of the SEC Documents  contained any untrue  statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated  therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein,  in light of the circumstances
in which they were made,  not  misleading.  The  financial  statements of Buyer,
including the notes thereto, included in the SEC Documents (the "Buyer Financial
Statements")  comply  as to  form  in  all  material  respects  with  applicable
accounting  requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect  thereto,  have been prepared in accordance with GAAP  consistently

unaudited  statements,  as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and present fairly
the  consolidated  financial  position  of Buyer at the  dates  thereof  and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject,  in the case of unaudited  statements,  to normal audit  adjustments).
There have been no changes in Buyer  accounting  policies except as described in
the notes to Buyer Financial Statements.  The SEC Documents contained an audited
consolidated  balance sheet of Buyer as of December 31, 2001 (the "Buyer Balance
Sheet") and the related audited consolidated  statements of income and cash flow
for the fiscal year then ended.

there has not occurred any event or  condition of any  character  that has had a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

the rules and regulations thereunder,  except that no representation or warranty
is made by Buyer with respect to statements  made or  incorporated  by reference
therein based on information supplied by the Sellers in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement.

     5.11  Reorganization.  None of Buyer  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has any
knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would prevent the Merger, if effected
in accordance with this Agreement,  from qualifying as a  reorganization  within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

     5.12 Buyer Acknowledgement.  In entering into this Agreement, each of Buyer
and  Acquisition  Subsidiary  acknowledges  that it has  relied,  and  shall  be
entitled to rely,  solely upon the  representations,  warranties,  covenants and
other terms,  conditions  and provisions set forth in this Agreement as modified

any breach of this Agreement or otherwise  pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be
made at such time as set forth in the Escrow Agreement,  and the value per share
of such Escrow  Shares  shall be the Terex FMV  (subject to  adjustment  for any
stock  splits,   reverse  splits,   recapitalizations  or  similar  transactions
occurring after the Closing) (as adjusted, the "Offset Price").

     (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Escrow Shares held in the Escrow
Account  shall  not be  deemed  the sole  source  of  recourse  by the Buyer for
indemnification  under  this  Agreement,  and the  Sellers  remain  jointly  and
severally liable in accordance with the terms of Article XI.

     6.9 Closing  Debt.  On the  Closing  Date,  the  Closing  Debt shall not be
greater than the Target Debt. In the event that the Closing Debt is greater than
the Target  Debt,  Buyer  shall have the right to proceed to  Closing,  in which
event the Cash Consideration  shall be reduced by amount equal to the difference
between the Closing Debt and the Target Debt.

     6.10 Non-Competition. As an inducement for Buyer to execute this Agreement,
each of Robert  Wilkerson,  S. Ward  Bushnell and F. Roger Brown has agreed with
Buyer  that:  (i)  Robert   Wilkerson  shall  execute  a   non-competition   and
confidentiality agreement substantially the form attached as Exhibit H-1 hereto,
and (ii) each of S. Ward Bushnell and F. Roger Brown shall enter into amendments
to their change in control  agreements in substantially the form attached hereto

with the Company to enter into amendments to such change in control  agreements,
each amended agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit H-3 hereto.

     Buyer agrees that:

     7.1 Certain  Actions.  From the date hereof until the Effective Time, Buyer
agrees  that it shall not,  without the  written  consent of the  Sellers  (such
consent not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  knowingly take any action
that  is  intended  or is  reasonably  likely  to  result  in  (a)  any  of  its
representations  and warranties  set forth in this  Agreement  being or becoming
untrue in any  respect  at any time at or prior to the  Closing,  (b) any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article IX not being  satisfied,  or (c) a

     7.2  Obligations  Regarding  Acquisition  Subsidiary.  Upon the  terms  and
subject to the  conditions  of this  Agreement,  Buyer shall  cause  Acquisition
Subsidiary  to  consummate  the Merger  hereunder  and agrees  that prior to the

operations  nor  incur  any  liabilities  of any kind or  nature  other  than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     7.3 Access To Records.  Following the Closing,  Buyer will (a) provide each
of  the  Sellers,  their  counsel,   financial  advisors  and  other  authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to any applicable
properties,  offices,  records,  files,  documents  and the like relating to the
Company  and its  Affiliates  during  the  period  prior  to  Closing  that  are
reasonably necessary in connection with Litigation involving any of the Sellers,
with any legal obligation owed by any of the Sellers to any Governmental  Entity
or any present or former  customer  or account of the Company or its  Affiliates
during the period prior to the Closing and (b) instruct the  employees,  counsel
and financial  advisors of the Surviving  Entity or any of its  Subsidiaries  to

contained in this Section 7.3 shall be subject to the  execution and delivery by


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

the  Sellers of a  confidentiality  agreement  substantially  in the form of the
Confidentiality  Agreement and that any  investigation  pursuant to this Section
7.3 shall be conducted in such manner as not to unreasonably  interfere with the
conduct of the business of Buyer and the Surviving  Entity.

     7.4  Preparation  of the Form S-3.  Upon the later of (i) 10 Business  Days
after Closing and (ii) seven  Business Days after the date the Company  provides
all information  either requested by Buyer or otherwise  required by the SEC for
inclusion in the Registration  Statement,  Buyer shall prepare and file with the
SEC  the  Registration   Statement  in  connection  with  the  resale  of  Stock
Consideration  issued  under  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the
Registration  Rights  Agreement.  Each of the  Sellers and Buyer shall use their
commercially  reasonable  efforts to have the  Registration  Statement  declared
effective  under the  Securities  Act as soon as  practicable  after the  filing
thereof.  Buyer shall take all  reasonable and necessary  action  required to be
taken under any applicable  securities  Laws in connection  with the issuance of
the Stock  Consideration  and the  Sellers  and the  Company  shall  furnish all
information  concerning  the  Company  and  the  holders  of  Shares  as  may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

     7.5  Employee  Arrangements.  (a)  Section 7.5 of the  Sellers'  Disclosure
Schedule  sets  forth,  with  respect to each  employee  of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries,  such employee's name,  current and 2001  compensation  (including
salary and any bonus),  length of employment with the Company or its Subsidiary,
as the case may be, and his/her  position  with the  Company or its  Subsidiary.
Following the Effective Time,  Buyer shall provide  individuals who are employed
by the  Company and its  Subsidiaries  as of the  Effective  Time and who remain
employed with Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer  ("Affected  Employees"),  for so
long as such Affected  Employees  remain  employed by Buyer or any Subsidiary of
Buyer,  with employee  benefits  pursuant to employee  benefit plans,  programs,
policies  or  arrangements  maintained  by  Buyer  or any  Subsidiary  of  Buyer
providing  coverage and benefits which, in the aggregate,  are no less favorable
than those  provided to  employees  of Buyer or its  Subsidiaries  in  positions
comparable  to  positions   held  by  Affected   Employees  with  Buyer  or  its
Subsidiaries from time to time after the Effective Time.

     (b) Buyer  will,  or will cause a  Subsidiary  of Buyer to,  give  Affected
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and the determination
of the  level of  benefits  under any  employee  benefit  plans or  arrangements
maintained  by Buyer or any of its  Subsidiaries  for such  Affected  Employees'
service  with the  Company or any  Subsidiary  of the Company to the same extent
recognized by the Company  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time;  provided,
however,  such service need not be credited to benefit accrual under any defined
benefit  pension plan and to the extent that it would result in a duplication of
benefits.

     (c) Buyer  will,  or will  cause a  Subsidiary  of Buyer to,  (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting  conditions,  exclusions and waiting  periods with
respect to participation  and coverage  requirements  applicable to the Affected
Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate  in after the  Effective  Time,  other than  limitations  or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such  employees and that have
not been  satisfied as of the Effective  Time under any welfare plan  maintained
for the Affected  Employees  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time, and (ii)
provide each Affected  Employee with credit for any  co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective  Time in the year in which the Effective Time occurs
for  purposes  of  satisfying   any  applicable   deductible  or   out-of-pocket
requirements  under any  welfare  plans  that such  employees  are  eligible  to
participate in after the Effective Time.

                                      -39-
<PAGE>


     (d)  Following  the  Effective  Time,  Affected  Employees  will  have  the
opportunity to participate in Buyer's  incentive plans (i) to the same extent as
employees of Buyer in  positions  comparable  to positions  held by the Affected
Employees  are  entitled to  participate  and (ii) in  accordance  with  Buyer's
internal policies and in accordance with the terms, restrictions and eligibility
requirements of such plans.

     (e) Following the Effective Time, Buyer will, or will cause a Subsidiary of
Buyer to, provide  Affected  Employees,  for so long as such Affected  Employees
remain employed with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, with annual base salaries
or rates of base pay comparable to the annual base salaries or rates of base pay
provided by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to employees of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries  in positions  comparable to positions  held by Affected  Employees
with Buyer or its Subsidiaries from time to time after the Effective Time.

     7.6  Contingent  Payment.  (a) Subject to Section  7.6(d) below,  if on any
Qualifying  Date the  Average  Buyer  Common  Stock Price for the ten day period
ending on the  applicable  Qualifying  Date is less than the Buyer  Common Stock
Guaranteed Value, Buyer will pay the Sellers fully paid and nonassessable shares
of Buyer Common  Stock,  in an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the amount in
US dollars to be paid in accordance  with Sections  7.6(b)(ii) or (iii),  as the
case may be, divided by (B) the respective  Average Qualifying Date Buyer Common
Stock  Price for the ten day period  ending on the  applicable  Qualifying  Date
(each of which is hereinafter  referred to as a "Contingent  Payment"),  in each
case,  within thirty days after the applicable  Qualifying Date.  Subject to the
provisions  of this  Section  7.6,  each Seller  shall  receive a portion of the
Contingent Payment equal to such Seller's Pro Rata Portion.

     (b) The respective amount of any Contingent  Payment shall be determined as
follows:

          (i) If the Qualifying Date Multiple for the respective Qualifying Date
     is equal to or greater  than 1.15,  then the  Sellers  shall not  receive a
     Contingent Payment for such Qualifying Date.

          (ii) If the  Qualifying  Date Multiple for the  respective  Qualifying
     Date is equal to or less than 1.00,  then the  Sellers  shall  receive  the
     Maximum Contingent Payment for the respective Qualifying Date.

          (iii) If the Qualifying  Date Multiple for the  respective  Qualifying
     Date exceeds 1.00 but is less than 1.15, then the Contingent  Payment shall
     be calculated on the basis of the following formula:

                          MCPx[1.00-((QDM-1.00)/0.15)]

                                      -40-
<PAGE>


     (c) In the event that on or prior to the twenty-four  month  anniversary of
the  Closing  or  during  one of the  time  periods  during  which  the  Average
Qualifying  Date Buyer  Common  Stock Price is  calculated,  Buyer (i) splits or
combines Buyer Common Stock  outstanding;  (ii) merges or consolidates  with any
corporation  in a transaction  in which the other  corporation  is the surviving
entity;  (iii)  reorganizes,  recapitalizes or reclassifies any of the shares of
Buyer Common Stock; or (iv) effects any transaction having a similar effect, the
parties shall co-operate in order to replace the calculation method set forth in
this Section 7.6 by another calculation  method,  which corresponds to the sense
and purpose of the calculation method initially set forth in this Section 7.6.

     (d)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision in this Section 7.6, the MCP for
each Qualifying Date shall be reduced in accordance with this Section 7.6(d), if
at any time prior to such Qualifying Date (each, a "Reduction Event"):

          (i) the Buyer  delivers a Release Notice to each of the Sellers or the
     Sellers'  Representative  and the Sellers sell such Buyer Common Stock that
     was the subject of such Release Notice, provided that the MCP shall only be
     reduced  with  respect to those shares of Buyer Common Stock sold after the
     delivery of the Release Notice;

          (ii) the Buyer  delivers a Release  Notice and the Average  Qualifying
     Date Buyer Common Stock Price for any consecutive ten day period during the
     Release Period exceeds the Buyer Common Stock  Guaranteed  Value,  provided
     that the MCP shall only be reduced  with  respect to those  shares of Buyer
     Common Stock which were the subject of such Release Notice;

          (iii) the Sellers sell, transfer,  convey, pledge or otherwise dispose
     of shares of Buyer Common  Stock  pursuant to Section  8.4(b)(i),  provided
     that the MCP shall only be reduced  with  respect to those  shares of Buyer
     Common  Stock  which  were  transferred,  conveyed,  pledged  or  otherwise
     disposed of pursuant to Section 8.4(b)(i); or

          (iv) the Sellers enter into any hedging  transaction  permitted  under
     Section  7.6(g) and such  transaction  assures an amount per share of Buyer
     Common Stock in excess of the Buyer Common Stock Guaranteed Value, provided
     that the MCP shall only be reduced  with  respect to those  shares of Buyer
     Common Stock which were the subject of such hedging transaction.

     In the event of a Reduction  Event,  the MCP for such Qualifying Date shall
be reduced by a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Buyer  Common  Stock  which are the subject of the  Reduction  Event for such
Qualifying  Date and the  denominator of which is the total number of Restricted
Shares for such Qualifying Date.

                                      -41-
<PAGE>


     (e) For purposes of this Section 7.6, any shares of Buyer Common Stock sold
after the  delivery of a Release  Notice  shall be deemed to relate first to the
next Qualifying Date and then to the next Qualifying Date thereafter.

     (f) In  calculating  the amounts due under this  Section  7.6,  all numbers
shall be rounded to the nearest thousandth.

     (g) During the five Trading Days  immediately  prior to and the ten Trading
Days during each period in which the Average  Qualifying Date Buyer Common Price
is  calculated  (the  "Trading  Restriction  Period"),  each Seller  agrees that
neither it nor its Affiliates or related entities will sell,  transfer,  assign,
convey,  pledge or otherwise dispose of any Buyer Common Stock, or engage in any
form of hedging  transaction  related to Buyer Common  Stock,  including but not
limited to the purchase or sale of any puts, calls or enter into any transaction
that has the effect of or is equivalent to engaging in Short Sales. For purposes
hereof, a "Short Sale" by a Seller or its Affiliate or related entity shall mean
a sale of Buyer Common Stock by such person that is made at any time, whether or
not there is an  equivalent  offsetting  long position in the Buyer Common Stock
held by such person.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Sellers may enter into
hedging  transactions,  including a (i) loan or (ii) pledge of such Buyer Common
Stock in connection with such hedging transaction, at any time other than during
the Trading Restriction Period.

     7.7 Acces  Industrie  Receivable  Contingent  Payment.  (a)  Following  the
Closing and irrespective of any indemnification payment made pursuant to Section
11.2(f),  Buyer shall,  or shall cause its Affiliates  to, use its  commercially
reasonable efforts to collect the Acces Industrie  Receivable  outstanding as of
the Closing Date; provided,  however, that Buyer shall not be required to pursue
collection of the Acces Industrie Receivable through Litigation.  Within 20 days
following the end of each Post-Closing  Calendar Half (as defined below),  Buyer
shall  deliver to the Sellers a  certificate  (the  "Receivables  Certificate"),
executed  by an  officer  of Buyer,  setting  forth (i) the  amount of the Acces
Industrie Receivable collected during the previous  Post-Closing  Calendar Half,
(ii) the amount of any Acces  Foreclosure  Proceeds received by Buyer during the
previous  Post-Closing  Calendar Half,  (iii) the amount of the Acces  Industrie
Receivable  then-outstanding,  (iv) the amount,  if any, of the Acces  Industrie
Receivable  past  due,  and  (v) the  amount,  if any,  of the  Acces  Industrie
Receivable which is more than 90 days past due (the "Access  Receivable Past Due
Amount").  Any dispute as to the contents of a Receivables  Certificate shall be
satisfied  by the  parties as if it were a "claim" in  accordance  with  Section
11.4.

     (b) Within 10 Business  Days  following  the  delivery  of each  Receivable
Certificate,  Buyer shall issue to Sellers  (the  "Acces  Receivable  Contingent
Payment") a number of fully paid and nonassessable  shares of Buyer Common Stock
equal to the quotient of (A) the Sellers' Applicable Percentage times the sum of
(i) the amount in US dollars  collected during such  Post-Closing  Calendar Half
with respect to the Acces Industrie Receivable and (ii) the amount in US dollars
of any Acces  Foreclosure  Proceeds  received by Buyer during such  Post-Closing
Calendar Half, each as set forth on the Receivables Certificate,  divided by (B)
the average of the closing prices of Buyer Common Stock on the NYSE, as reported
by The Wall Street Journal (national  edition) (or if not reported  thereby,  as
reported by any other  authoritative  source) for ten  consecutive  Trading Days


                                      -42-
<PAGE>


ending on the last day of such Post-Closing  Calendar Half;  provided,  however,
that in no event shall the Sellers  receive any amount in excess of the Sellers'
Applicable  Percentage of the  outstanding  amount due under the Acces Industrie
Receivable as of the Closing  Date.  To the extent that,  following the Closing,
Buyer  or the  Company  forgives  any  amount  due  under  the  Acces  Industrie
Receivable and receives an economic  benefit (other than a Tax benefit) for such
forgiveness, such amounts shall be deemed to have been collected for purposes of
this  Section 7.7, but only to the extent of such  economic  benefit;  provided,
that the indemnity  provided for in Section  11.2(f) will not be deemed to be an
economic benefit for purposes of this Section 7.7(b).  Subject to the provisions
of this Section 7.7, each Seller shall receive a portion of the Acces  Industrie
Receivable  Contingent  Payment  equal to the  Seller's  Pro Rata  Portion.  For
purposes of this Section 7.7,  "Post-Closing Calendar Half" means each six-month
period  ending  during the period  which begins after the Closing Date and which
ends prior to, or  includes,  the last date on which  payments are due under the
Acces Industrie  Receivable,  provided that the first Post-Closing Calendar Half
shall be deemed to begin on the Closing Date.

     7.8 Officers' and Directors' Indemnification. The Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless to the fullest extent  permitted under the Company  Articles as of
the Closing Date each present and former director and officer of the Company and
its Subsidiaries,  determined as of the Closing (the "Covered D&O Indemnitees"),
against  any  costs  and  expenses  (including   reasonable   attorneys'  fees),
judgments,  fines,  losses,  claims,  damages  (including,  but not  limited to,
punitive,  aggravated or exemplary) or liabilities  incurred in their capacities
as such in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil,  criminal,  administrative  or  investigative,  arising out of or
pertaining  to  matters  existing  or  occurring  prior  to  or at  the  Closing
(including  as a result of the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby),  whether  asserted or claimed prior to, or after the Closing,  provided
that the Covered D&O Indemnitees shall not be indemnified for any claim, action,
suit,  proceeding  or  investigation  which (i) is  brought by or on behalf of a
Seller  or (ii)  arises  out of a Covered  D&O  Indemnitee's  gross  negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud.

     7.9  Tax   Matters.   Buyer   shall   not  take  any   Prohibited   Action.
Notwithstanding  any other  cause of action or claim  Sellers  may have,  in the
event  Buyer  takes any  Prohibited  Action,  then  Sellers'  Damages  resulting
therefrom,   whether   pursuant  to  this  Agreement,   any   certification   or
representations  made by Buyer, any tax opinion received by Sellers or otherwise
shall be governed solely by this Section 7.9.  Notwithstanding  anything in this
Agreement,  any other agreement,  any certification or  representations  made by
Buyer,  any tax opinion  received  by  Sellers,  or any other cause of action or
claim Sellers may have, in the event Buyer takes one or more Prohibited  Actions
and obtains a Tax Opinion  relating to such  Prohibited  Action then the maximum
Damages payable by Buyer to Sellers, in the aggregate, as a result of the taking
of such Prohibit Action shall not exceed $1,000,000. In the event Buyer does not
obtain a Tax Opinion,  the Sellers reserve all rights (contractual or otherwise)
to which  they are  entitled  as a matter of Law  arising  from such  Prohibited
Action.

     7.10   Recapitalization.   Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  in  this
Agreement to the  contrary,  at any time prior to the Closing the Company  shall
have the right to recapitalize its outstanding capital stock into Class A Shares
(the "Class A Shares") and Class B Shares (the "Class B Shares") and to exchange
all or a portion  of the Class A Shares  for Class B Shares on a share for share
basis (the "Recapitalization"). Following the Recapitalization, any reference in
this Agreement to "Seller  Shares" shall mean "Class A Shares," any reference to
"Trust  Shares" shall mean "Class B Shares," and any reference to "Shares" shall
mean, collectively, Class A Shares and Class B Shares.

     8.1  Reasonable  Best Efforts.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement,  each of Buyer,  Acquisition Subsidiary,  the Sellers and the Company
shall use their  reasonable  best  efforts  to take,  or cause to be taken,  all
actions  and to do,  or  cause to be  done,  all  things  necessary,  proper  or
desirable  under  applicable  Laws and  agreements  to consummate as promptly as

     8.2  Certain  Filings.  (a) Buyer and each of the  Sellers  shall,  and the
Sellers  shall cause the Company and its  Subsidiaries  to,  cooperate  with one
another  (i) in  determining  whether  any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions,  consents,  approvals
or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts or
agreements, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement  and (ii) in taking such actions or making any such  filings,
furnishing  information  required  in  connection  therewith  and,  as  soon  as

extent legally  required,  each of the Sellers shall file, and the Sellers shall
cause the Company to  cooperate  with Buyer in filing,  with the  Department  of
Justice, the filings necessary under the HSR Act.

     8.3 Public  Announcements.  Neither Buyer,  on the one hand, nor any of the
Sellers,  on the other hand, shall, and the Sellers shall not permit the Company

exchange.

     8.4 Lock-up;  Registration Rights Agreement. (a) Unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by Buyer in the form of a Release  Notice or subject to clause (b) of
this Section 8.4, during the twenty-four month period immediately  following the

<PAGE>


     (b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  during the Restriction Period, each of
the Sellers shall be permitted to sell,  transfer,  convey,  pledge or otherwise
dispose of its Pro Rata  Portion  of:  (i) the number of shares of Buyer  Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of (A) the
difference between $25 million less the total Cash Consideration  divided by (B)
the Buyer Price,  (ii) up to one-half of the Stock  Consideration  following the
twelve month  anniversary of the Closing Date, (iii) up to three quarters of the

released pursuant to clause (ii) above) following the eighteen month anniversary
of the  Closing  Date and  (iv) all of the  Stock  Consideration  following  the
twenty-four  month  anniversary of the Closing Date. The operative  agreement of
the Trust  shall  provide  that the Trust is not  permitted  to sell,  transfer,
convey,  pledge  or  otherwise  dispose  of the  Trust  Consideration  until the
twenty-four  month  anniversary  of the Closing  Date,  at which point the Trust
Consideration  will no longer be subject to the  restrictions  set forth in this
Section 8.4.

     (c) At the  Closing,  Buyer and each of the  Sellers  shall  enter into the
Registration  Rights  Agreement,  substantially  in the form of Exhibit A hereto
(the "Registration Rights Agreement").

     (d)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in Section  8.4(a),  Sellers
shall not be subject to the restrictions  set forth in Section 8.4(a),  and such
restrictions  shall  terminate  in  their  entirety,  upon  the  Buyer  taking a
Prohibited  Action  without  obtaining  a Should  Opinion  with  respect to such
Prohibited Action.

     (e)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions set forth in Section  8.4(a),  in the
event the Sellers  are  required to  indemnify  a Buyer  Indemnitee  pursuant to
Article XI, the restrictions  set forth in Section 8.4(a) shall  terminate,  but
only with  respect to the number of shares of Buyer  Common  Stock in the Escrow
Account necessary to enable the Sellers to pay the  indemnification  obligations
pursuant to Article XI.

     8.5 Confidentiality. Prior to the Closing Date and after any termination of
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in effect.

     8.6  Tax  Representation  Letter.   Officers  of  the  Buyer,   Acquisition
Subsidiary  and the Company and each of the Sellers shall execute and deliver to
Skadden,  Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to the Company, a certificate
substantially  in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit C, D or E, as applicable,

of, filings and  registrations  with,  and  notifications  to, all  Governmental
Entities required for the consummation of the Merger shall have been obtained or
made and shall be in full force and effect and all waiting  periods  required by
Law  shall  have  expired,  including  the  expiration  or  termination  of  any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

     (b) No Injunction.  No Governmental Entity of competent  jurisdiction shall
have enacted, issued,  promulgated,  enforced or entered any statute or Judgment
(whether  temporary,  preliminary or permanent)  that is in effect and prohibits
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (c) Go Credit. The sale,  conveyance,  assignment and delivery of the stock
of Go Credit  Corporation as set forth in the Stock Purchase  Agreement,  in the
form  attached  hereto as Exhibit F, shall have been  consummated  in the manner

     9.2 Further  Conditions to  Obligation of the Sellers and the Company.  The
obligation  of each of the Sellers and the Company to  consummate  the Merger is
also  subject  to the  fulfillment  or  written  waiver by each of the  Sellers,
individually  and on behalf of the Company,  prior to the Closing of each of the
following conditions:

     (a) Representations  and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
Buyer  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  (disregarding  all  references  in  such
representations  and warranties to  "materiality,"  "material  adverse  change,"
"Material Adverse Effect" and "in all material respects" or similar expressions)
shall  be  true  and   correct  at  and  as  of  the   Closing  as  though  such
representations  and warranties  were made at and as of such date (except to the
extent  expressly  made as of an earlier  date, in which case, as of such date),
except (i) changes  specifically  permitted by this  Agreement or resulting from
any transaction  expressly consented to in writing by the Sellers and (ii) where
the failure of such  representations  and  warranties  to be so true and correct
does not have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

     (b)  Performance of  Obligations  of Buyer.  Buyer shall have performed the
obligations  required to be performed by it under this Agreement in all material
respects  at or prior to the  Closing,  and the  Sellers  shall have  received a

officer of Buyer to such effect.

     (c)  Officer's  Certificate.  Buyer shall have  delivered to the Sellers an
officer's  certificate to the effect that each of the conditions specified above

delivered the Registration  Rights Agreement  substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A.

     (e) Tax Opinion.  There shall have been, after the date hereof,  no changes
in Law (including the Code, the Treasury  Regulations,  revenue rulings or other
written administrative or judicial  interpretations but excluding private letter
rulings and  technical  advice  memoranda  except to the extent they are clearly
applicable  because their facts and circumstances  are substantially  similar to
the facts and  circumstances  of the Merger) that would prevent  Skadden,  Arps,
Slate,  Meagher & Flom LLP,  counsel to the Company,  from  rendering an opinion
substantially  to the effect that the Merger will constitute a  "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,  provided,  that if there have
been any such changes of Law after the date hereof, the parties hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make changes to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement so that Skadden,  Arps,  Slate,  Meagher & Flom LLP can render
its  opinion,  provided  further,  that no party shall be required to accept any
changes to the  transactions  contemplated by this paragraph (e) if such changes
alter in more than an  insignificant  manner the  economics of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the covenants, representations or restrictions
on Buyer or Acquisition Subsidiary contained within this Agreement. In rendering
such opinion, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP shall be entitled to rely
upon representations, covenants and warranties of Buyer, Acquisition Subsidiary,
Sellers and the Company as set forth in Exhibits C, D and E.

     (f) Tax Certificate.  An officer of the Buyer and an officer of Acquisition
Subsidiary  shall have  delivered a duly executed  certificate,  dated as of the
Closing Date,  reaffirming  the accuracy of the  statements  on the  certificate
(attached  hereto as  Exhibit  C)  executed  by an  officer  of the Buyer and an
officer of Acquisition Subsidiary as of the date hereof.

adverse  change,"  "Material  Adverse Effect" and "in all material  respects" or
similar  expressions)  shall be true and  correct  at and as of the  Closing  as
though  such  representations  and  warranties  were made at and as of such date
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case, as of
such date)  except (i)  changes  specifically  permitted  by this  Agreement  or
resulting from any  transaction  expressly  consented to in writing by Buyer and
(ii) where the failure of such  representations and warranties to be so true and
correct  does not have,  in the  aggregate,  a  Material  Adverse  Effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

     (b) Performance of Obligations of the Sellers.  The Sellers and the Company
shall have performed the obligations required to be performed by them under this
Agreement in all material  respects at or prior to the Closing,  and Buyer shall
have  received,  prior to the Closing,  a  certificate,  dated the Closing Date,

     (c) by any of Buyer or the Sellers (any action under this clause (c) by the

     The party  desiring  to  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Sections
10.1(b),  10.1(c), 10.1(d), 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other parties and this Agreement  shall  forthwith  terminate
and shall become null and void and of no further  effect,  and the  transactions
contemplated  hereby shall be abandoned  without  further action by the parties;
provided that each party shall  redeliver all  documents,  work papers and other
materials of the other parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether  so  obtained  before  or  after  the  execution  hereof,  to the  party
furnishing  the same,  and all  confidential  information  received by any party

existing  Confidentiality  Agreement  between  the  parties;  and  all  filings,
applications  and other  submissions  made pursuant  hereto shall, to the extent
reasonably  practicable,  be withdrawn  from the agency or other person to which

     10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by
Section 10.l,  this Agreement  shall  forthwith  become void,  there shall be no
liability  under this  Agreement on the part of any of the parties hereto or any

all rights and  obligations of each party hereto shall cease except as set forth

willful breach of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

     11.1 Survival.  Each of the  representations  and warranties of the parties
hereto  contained  in this  Agreement  or in any  certificate  or other  writing
required to be delivered  pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing and continue
until 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on the date which is twenty-four  months following
the Closing Date; provided that the representations and warranties  contained in
Sections  3.1,  3.2,   3.4,  4.2,   4.13(a),   4.13(e)  and  5.2  shall  survive
indefinitely; provided further that the representations and warranties contained
in Section 4.18 shall survive until the  three-year  anniversary  of the Closing
Date.  After the  expiration  of such period,  any claim by a party hereto based
upon any such  representation  or  warranty  shall be of no  further  force  and
effect,  except to the extent a party has  asserted a claim in  accordance  with
this Article XI for breach of any such  representation  or warranty prior to the
expiration  of such  period,  in which event any  representation  or warranty to
which such claim  relates  shall  survive  with respect to such claim until such
claim is resolved as provided in this  Article XI. This  Section  11.1 shall not
limit any covenant or agreement  of the parties  that  contemplates  performance
after the Closing.

     11.2  Indemnification.  (a)  Subject  to  the  limitations  and  procedures
described herein, the Sellers,  jointly and severally,  shall indemnify and hold
harmless  Buyer  and the  Surviving  Entity  and  their  respective  Affiliates,
directors,  officers,  employees, agents and controlling Persons (other than the
Sellers), and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the
foregoing   (each,  a  "Buyer   Indemnitee"   and,   collectively,   the  "Buyer
Indemnitees"),  against  and from any and all  Damages  incurred  or suffered by
Buyer Indemnitees (i) as a result of a breach of any of the  representations and
warranties  of any or all of the Sellers set forth in Article III and IV of this
Agreement  or (ii) as a result or  arising  out of a breach by any or all of the
Sellers of any covenant or  agreement of any or all of the Sellers  contained in
this Agreement not waived in writing by Buyer.

                                      -50-

     (b) Following  the Closing,  except in the case of common law fraud or with
respect to  matters  for which the remedy of  specific  performance,  injunctive
relief or other  nonmonetary  equitable  remedies  are  available,  the sole and
exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect to any and all Claims arising from breach
of this  Agreement  by any  Seller  shall  be  pursuant  to the  indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article XI.

     (c) No Buyer  Indemnitee  shall be  entitled  to  indemnity  under  Section
11.2(a)(i)  until  the  aggregate  amount  of the  Damages  for  which all Buyer
Indemnitees  would, but for this Section 11.2(c),  be entitled exceeds an amount
equal to  $2,000,000  (other  than  Damages  arising  out of or  resulting  from
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.13(a) or 4.13(e)),  and then only to the extent of any
such excess and in no event shall the Sellers' aggregate obligation to indemnify
Buyer   Indemnitees   with  respect  to  claims  under  this  Agreement   exceed
$20,000,000.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this  Agreement,  the
Sellers  shall have no  obligation  to indemnify  any Buyer  Indemnitee  for (i)
incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages except to the extent such
damages are awarded by a court or Governmental  Entity,  or (ii) Damages arising
out of such Buyer Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     (d) Buyer shall not have the right to withhold  and deduct any sum that may
be owed to any Buyer  Indemnitee  under this Article XI from  amounts  otherwise
payable by Buyer to Sellers pursuant to Sections 6.8, 7.5 or 7.7.

     (e) The Buyer and Acquisition Subsidiary,  on the one hand, and the Company
and the Sellers, on the other hand, have agreed that for purposes of determining
Damages incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees as a result of a breach of
Sections   4.13(a)   and   4.13(e)   (the   "Tax   Representations"),   the  Tax
Representations  shall be construed  as if they were not  qualified by the terms
"material," "materially" and "Material Adverse Effect".

     (f) (i) In the  event  that  there  exists  any Acces  Receivable  Past Due
Amount,  the Sellers shall  indemnify and hold harmless  Buyer and the Surviving
Entity and the Buyer  Indemnitees,  in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) $4.5
million  and (B) the  Buyer's  Applicable  Percentage  multiplied  by the  Acces
Receivable Past Due Amount and such indemnification amounts paid hereunder shall
be included in the  calculation  of the maximum  indemnity of $20,000,000 as set
forth in Section  11.2(c),  provided further that this Section 11.2(f) shall not
be subject to any other limitations set forth in Sections 11.2(a),  (b) and (c).
The Sellers shall be obligated to pay to Buyer and the Surviving  Entity and the
Buyer Indemnitees the Acces Receivable Past Due Amount within five Business Days
of receipt of the Receivables Certificate;  provided,  however, that the initial
payment pursuant to this Section 11.2(f) shall be made no earlier than the first
anniversary of the Closing,  provided,  further, such payments shall not be made
more frequently than once every six months thereafter.

        (ii) Buyer hereby agrees that, in the  event  that  Sellers  make  any
indemnification payments to Buyer pursuant to Section 11.2(f)(i) with respect to
any Acces Receivable Past Due Amount and Buyer subsequently  receives any amount
with respect to any Acces Receivable Past Due Amount (the "Subsequent Collection
Amount"),  Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount (the "Rebate") equal to the


                                      -51-
<PAGE>


excess,  if any, of (A) the amount of Seller's  total  indemnity  payments under
Section  11.2(f)  with  respect to any such Access  Receivable  Past Due Amount,
minus (B) the amount Sellers'  indemnity  payments would have been under Section
11.2(f)(ii)  if such  amount had been  timely  paid by Acces  Industrie  (or its
Affiliates).  The  Rebate  shall  increase  the  then  remaining  amount  of the
$20,000,000 overall cap on Sellers' aggregate  obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees  under Section  11.2(c).  In connection with  determining the amount
that  the  Sellers  would  be  entitled  to  receive  pursuant  to this  Section
11.2(f)(ii),  any Acces  Foreclosure  Proceeds  shall be treated as a Subsequent
Collection Amount.

     11.3  Indemnification  Procedures.  (a)  Any  party  claiming  a  right  to
indemnification  hereunder shall give the other party from whom  indemnification
is sought prompt written notice of any claim, demand,  action, suit,  proceeding
or discovery of fact (each, a "Claim") upon which the indemnified  party intends
to base a Claim for indemnification under this Section 11.3, provided,  however,
that no failure to give such notice shall excuse any indemnifying party from any
obligation  hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying  party is materially
prejudiced by such failure.

     (b)  Promptly  after  receipt by a Buyer  Indemnitee  under this Section of
notice of the commencement of any action, such Buyer Indemnitee will, if a Claim
in respect of such  action is to be made  against any  indemnifying  party under
this Section,  notify the Sellers' Representative in writing of the commencement
of such  action.  Such  notice  shall  include  the  amount of such  Claim and a
reasonably  detailed  statement as to the basis for the  assertion of the Claim.
Upon  receipt of such notice the  indemnifying  party or parties  shall have the
right to assume and  control  the  defense of such  action  with  counsel of its
choice; provided,  however, the indemnifying party or parties shall not have the
right to assume and control the defense of any actions which include a Claim for
equitable  relief;  provided,  further,  however,  in the case of any matter for
which the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to assume and control the defense,
the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
action  and to be  represented  by  counsel  of its or their  own  selection  in
connection with such actions and to be kept fully and completely informed by the
indemnifying  party and its counsel as to the status of the action at all stages
of the proceedings in such action, at the indemnifying party's cost and expense.
The Sellers hereby agree that the Sellers'  Representative shall at all times be
primarily  responsible  for the  assumption  and control of any such  defense on
behalf of the Sellers;  provided,  however,  that the foregoing shall not create
any individual liability on the part of the Sellers' Representative for any such
indemnification  Claim nor make such  representative  responsible  for advancing
costs or legal fees in connection  with any such defense.  The Buyer  Indemnitee
shall  have the right to  participate  in the  defense  of any  action and to be
represented  by counsel of its or their own  selection in  connection  with such
action and to be kept fully and completely  informed by the  indemnifying  party
and its counsel as to the status of the action at all stages of the  proceedings
in such  action,  all at the  Buyer  Indemnitee's  cost and  expense.  The Buyer
Indemnitee shall cooperate with the indemnifying  party in any defense which the
indemnifying party assumes.  Buyer shall be entitled to settle any action solely
for monetary  damages  with  respect to which it controls the defense;  provided
that the Sellers shall have no  indemnification  obligation  with respect to any
such settlement made without the Sellers' Representative's prior written consent
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Except as provided above, the
Buyer  Indemnitees shall not be entitled to admit any liability with respect to,
or  settle,  compromise  or  discharge  any Claim or consent to the entry of any
Judgment  with  respect  thereto  without the  Sellers'  Representative's  prior


                                      -52-
<PAGE>


written consent,  which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld The Sellers'
Representative  shall be  entitled  to settle  any action  solely  for  monetary
damages  with  respect to which they  control the  defense,  provided  that such
settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by claimant or
plaintiff to the Buyer  Indemnitee  of a written  release from all  liability in
respect of such Claim.

     (c)  The  Buyer   Indemnitees   shall  make   available   to  the  Sellers'
Representative  and its  counsel and  accountants,  all books and records of the
Buyer  Indemnitees  relating to any action,  suit or proceeding  and the parties
agree to render to each other such  assistance as may reasonably be requested in
order  to  insure  the  proper  and  adequate  defense  of any  action,  suit or
proceeding including reasonable access to employees and officers.

     (d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in Section 11.3(b) hereof, if
a Claim with respect to Taxes is to be made against any indemnifying party under
this Section:

          (i) The Sellers' Representative shall have the sole right to represent
     the Company's and each of the Company's  Subsidiary's interests in any such
     Claim relating to Taxes that relates to taxable periods ending on or before
     the  Closing  Date and to employ  counsel  of its  choice  at its  expense,
     provided,  however,  that  Sellers'  Representative  may not  agree  to any
     settlement or compromise  thereof that affects (or that might reasonably be
     expected to affect)  Buyer's,  the  Company's  or any Company  Subsidiary's
     liability for Taxes for any period after the Closing Date without the prior
     written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld
     or delayed. The Buyer Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the
     defense of any action and to be  represented by counsel of its or their own
     selection  in  connection  with  such  action  and  to be  kept  fully  and
     completely  informed  by the  indemnifying  party and its counsel as to the
     status of the action at all stages of the  proceedings in such action,  all
     at the Buyer  Indemnitee's  cost and expense.  With the written  consent of
     Seller,  Buyer may  assume  control of such  entire  Tax Claim (at  Buyer's
     expense).

          (ii) Buyer shall have the sole right to represent  the  Company's  and
     each of the Company  Subsidiaries'  interests in any such Claim relating to
     Taxes that relates to a Straddle Period or a taxable period beginning on or
     after the Closing Date and to employ  counsel of its choice at its expense,
     provided,  however, that Sellers' Representative shall have the right to be
     kept  fully and  completely  informed  by Buyer and its  counsel  as to the
     status of the action at all stages of the proceeding  and, with the written
     consent of Buyer,  at Sellers'  expense,  may assume control of such entire
     Tax Claim and provided  further that Sellers'  Representative,  at its sole
     expense,  shall have the right to  participate in the defense of any action
     (and be represented by counsel of its own selection in connection with such
     action)  if  such  action  (A)  relates  in  any  material  part  to  Taxes
     attributable  to the portion of such  Straddle  Period  deemed to end on or
     before the Closing  Date, or (B) relates to the tax treatment of the Merger
     as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

                                      -53-

          (iii)  None of Buyer,  any of its  Affiliates  and  Subsidiaries,  the
     Company or any Company Subsidiary may agree to any settlement or compromise
     of any such Claim that affects (or might  reasonably be expected to affect)
     Sellers'  liability  for Damages  relating  to Taxes  under this  Agreement
     without the prior  written  consent of the Sellers'  Representative,  which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          (iv) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in Sections 11.3(d)(ii)
     or (iii),  with respect to any  particular  Claim  relating to Taxes (other
     than any  Claim  that  relates  to the tax  treatment  of the  Merger  as a
     "reorganization"  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code),  Buyer
     may, after receipt of a 30-day letter or other written proposed  adjustment
     to Taxes by a taxing authority, elect to fix Sellers' liability for Damages
     related  to Taxes  (even  though  the  underlying  Tax  matter has not been
     finally  settled or otherwise  closed with the applicable tax authority) by
     submitting  in  writing  a  proposed   settlement   amount  (the  "Proposed
     Settlement") to Sellers' Representative. If such Proposed Settlement amount
     is accepted by Sellers'  Representative  within 10 Business Days of receipt
     thereof, then it shall become final and binding on the Sellers, the Company
     and the Buyer and  otherwise  have the  effects  described  in the last two
     sentences of this clause (iv), below. If Sellers'  Representative  fails to
     respond  to Buyer  within  10  Business  Days of  receipt  of the  Proposed
     Settlement, then no acceptance will be presumed. If Sellers' Representative
     does not timely  accept in writing such  Proposed  Settlement,  then a "Big
     Four"  independent  accounting firm mutually  acceptable to the Sellers and
     Buyer shall  determine  within 20 Business  Days the amount,  if any,  that
     should be paid by Seller to Buyer in  satisfaction  of that  particular Tax
     Claim;  provided,  however,  that in no case shall such  amount  exceed the
     amount set forth in the Proposed Settlement.  The fees and expenses of such
     accounting firm (i) in the case of Proposed Settlement amounts greater than
     or equal to $100,000,  shall be borne equally by the Sellers and Buyer, and
     (ii) in the case of Proposed  Settlement amounts less than $100,000,  shall
     be borne equally by the Sellers and Buyers unless the Final  Settlement (as
     defined below) is less than 85% of the Proposed  Settlement,  in which case
     Buyer shall pay all such fees and expenses.  Upon written  determination of
     the  final   settlement   (whether   by  consent  of  Buyer  and   Sellers'
     Representative  or by resolution by the independent  accounting  firm) (the
     "Final  Settlement"),  Buyer's Claim for Damages under this Article XI with
     respect to that  particular  Claim  relating  to Taxes  shall be treated as
     resolved  in the amount set forth in the Final  Settlement,  shall be final
     and  binding,  and  Sellers  shall pay such  amount to Buyer or Buyer shall
     enforce its Claim for such amount against Sellers. Furthermore,  after such
     Final  Settlement,  Sellers shall have no consent rights or other rights as


                                      -54-
<PAGE>


     to the  settlement,  compromise or other  disposition of the underlying Tax
     matter  giving rise to the Claim,  provided,  that Buyer  shall  report the
     ultimate  outcome  of any such  Claim  to the  Sellers'  Representative  in
     writing  within  20  Business  Days of such  Claim's  settlement  or  other
     disposition with a Governmental  Entity or judicial court, and if the Claim
     is ultimately settled or otherwise resolved for an amount that is less than
     the amount of the Final  Settlement,  then Buyer shall promptly transfer to
     Seller's  Representative an amount in cash equal to the difference  between
     the  amount  of the Final  Settlement  and the  amount  of the  settlement,
     judgment or other resolution.

     11.4 Claims  Resolution  Procedure.  The parties shall act in good faith as
expeditiously  as  possible  to resolve  any and all  Claims.  To the extent any
Claims  are made (by  written  notice to the  Sellers'  Representative)  but not
Finally  Resolved  (as  defined  in  the  Escrow  Agreement)  on or  before  the
appropriate  survival date as identified in Section 11.1 (the "Claims Resolution
Date"),  then such  claims  and any other  disputes,  controversies  or  claims,
arising out of or  relating to this  Agreement  or the  breach,  termination  or
validity  thereof,  whether  such claims  arise in  contract,  tort or otherwise
("Disputes")  shall,  on the demand of any party, be resolved in accordance with
the following arbitration procedure:

     (a) The  arbitration  shall be held and the  award  shall be  issued in New
York,  New York in  accordance  with  the  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules of the
American  Arbitration  Association ("AAA") then in effect (the "Rules") by three
neutral and impartial  arbitrators.  Subject to Section  11.4(c) below,  each of
Buyer,  on the one hand,  and the Sellers,  on the other hand,  shall select and
appoint an arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the receipt by respondent of
a copy of the demand for  arbitration,  and shall  promptly give the other party
notice of such appointment. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator,  who shall serve as chair of the arbitral  tribunal,  within fifteen
days after the  appointment  of the second  arbitrator,  and shall promptly give
written notice to the parties  hereto and the AAA of such  selection  within ten
(10) days after the Claims  Resolution  Date. No arbitrator shall be an officer,
director,  employee,  Affiliate  or relative  of, or have any prior  business or
personal  relationship with either the Buyer or any Subsidiary  thereof,  any of
their respective  officers and directors,  the Company,  its Subsidiaries or the
Sellers.

     (b) The  arbitrators  shall  render an award  within one hundred and twenty
days after the  appointment  of the third  arbitrator.  Such time  period  maybe
extended  with the consent of the parties or by the  arbitrators  for good cause
shown.  The award  shall be in  writing,  shall  state the  findings of fact and
conclusions  of law on which it is  based,  and  shall be  signed by each of the
arbitrators.  The award  shall be final and  binding on the  parties  and may be
enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Once the award is made, a Claim shall
be Finally Resolved for purposes of the Escrow Agreement.

     (c) If either  party  shall  refuse or  neglect  to select  and  appoint an
arbitrator  within ten days after the Claims  Resolution Date in accordance with
Section  11.4(a),  then the second  arbitrator  shall be appointed by the AAA in
accordance with the listing,  ranking and striking  procedure in the Rules.  Any
arbitrator-chair  appointed by the AAA shall be a retired  judge or a practicing
attorney  with no less  than  fifteen  years of  experience  and an  experienced
arbitrator.

                                      -55-

     (d) The parties shall initially bear their own costs and legal fees and the
fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be initially shared equally by Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Sellers,  on the other,  provided that the  arbitrators
may, in their own discretion,  award  reasonable legal fees and expenses and the
costs of arbitration to the prevailing party or parties in the arbitration.  The
parties hereto agree that they will cooperate to allow any arbitration hereunder
to occur promptly and be concluded as expeditiously as is reasonably possible.

     (e) Judgment of any arbitration  conducted  hereunder may be entered on the
arbitrators'  award in any court  having  jurisdiction,  and each  party  hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of the federal and New York state courts sitting in
New York County for this purpose.

     11.5 Satisfaction of Indemnity  Claims.  Subject to the limitations in this
Article  XI and the Escrow  Agreement,  any claim for  indemnification  shall be
settled in the following manner:

     (a) Buyer shall deliver a Claim Notice (as defined in the Escrow Agreement)
in  accordance  with the terms of the Escrow  Agreement.  The Claim Notice shall
include the amount of any claim for  indemnification,  the  calculation  of such
amount in reasonable detail and the grounds for such indemnification.

     (b) upon  receipt of a Claim  Notice,  the Sellers  shall have the right to
elect to satisfy any claim for  indemnification  with cash or other  property in
lieu of a sale or  substitution of Escrow Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, which election must be made by delivery of a notice by the
Sellers'  Representative  to the Buyer  within  ten days of  receipt  of a Claim
Notice or the time the applicable Claim is Finally Resolved, whichever is later;

     (c)  in  the  event  the   Sellers   elect  to   satisfy   such  claim  for
indemnification with cash or other property, the Sellers shall deliver,  through
the Sellers'  Representative,  such cash or other property in an amount equal to
the Damages  within ten Business Days' of the Claim being Finally  Resolved,  in
which  case the  number of Escrow  Shares  equal to the  Damages  divided by the
Offset  Price  shall be  released  to  Sellers'  Representative  and Buyer shall
deliver to the Sellers'  Representative  a Release Notice  releasing such Escrow
Shares from the Lock-up Provisions;

     (d) in the  event  the  Sellers  do not  elect to  satisfy  such  claim for
indemnification  with cash or property  pursuant to clause (c),  then after such
Claim is Finally  Resolved,  the Escrow  Agent shall  reduce the Escrow Fund and
deliver to Buyer cash  equal to the  Damages,  if the  Sellers  have  elected to
effect a substitution  in accordance  with the terms of the Escrow  Agreement or
shall reduce the Escrow Fund by the amount of Escrow Shares equal to the Damages
divided by the Offset Price and such Escrow  Shares shall be sold in  accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the proceeds  therefrom  delivered by
the  Escrow  Agent to Buyer;  provided,  however,  that if the amount of Damages
exceeds the amount  represented  by the Escrow  Shares  remaining  in the Escrow
Fund, then the Sellers, through the Sellers' Representative,  shall deliver cash
or other  property in the amount equal to (i) the Damages  minus (ii) the amount
determined  by  multiplying  the  Offset  Price by the  number of Escrow  Shares
remaining in the Escrow Account.
