 Each party hereto shall give prompt notice to the others of them of the occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the Effective Date, of any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, would be likely to or could: 

   

       | (a)  |   | cause any of the representations or warranties of

on the date hereof or on the Effective Date;  
---|---|---|---

indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative, advisor
or agent of Gold Eagle or the Gold Eagle Subsidiary, or otherwise:

       | (i)  |   | make, solicit, initiate, facilitate, entertain,
encourage or promote (including by way of furnishing information, permitting

understanding) any inquiries or proposals regarding, constituting or that may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | participate, directly or indirectly, in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information or otherwise co-operate with, respond to, assist or participate
in, any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | remain neutral with respect to, or agree to, approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to agree to, approve or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral position with  ##### 

 

 

36  

     |   |   | respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 15 Business
Days following formal commencement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not be
considered a violation of this subsection 6.01(a)(iii));

       | (iv)  |   | make, or propose publicly to make a Change in
Gold Eagle Recommendation;

action inconsistent with, or that could reasonably be likely to be regarded
as detracting from, the recommendation of the directors of Gold Eagle to
approve the transactions contemplated herein,  
   

  

       |   |   | provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
preceding part of this subsection 6.01(a), but subject to the following
provisions of Article 6 of this Agreement, the directors of Gold Eagle and on
the direction of any of the directors of Gold Eagle, any officer, employee,
representative, agent or advisor of Gold Eagle may, prior to the approval of
the Arrangement by Gold Eagle Shareholders, consider or negotiate any
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that may constitute a Superior Proposal, and
the directors of Gold Eagle may make a Change in Gold Eagle Recommendation in
respect of a Superior Proposal, or approve or recommend to the Gold Eagle
Shareholders or enter into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal in
accordance with the provisions of the following subsections of this Article 6
but in each case only if the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
breach of Section 6.01 of this Agreement by Gold Eagle and if the directors
of Gold Eagle determine in good faith after consulting with outside counsel
(which may include written opinions or advice) that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of such directors
under applicable Law.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Gold Eagle shall, and shall cause the officers,
directors, employees, consultants, representatives and agents of Gold Eagle
and its subsidiaries to, immediately terminate and cease any discussions or
negotiations on behalf of Gold Eagle with any parties (other than Goldcorp)
with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
to constitute, an Acquisition Proposal. Gold Eagle agrees not to release any
third party from any confidentiality agreement relating to a potential
Acquisition Proposal to which such third party is a party. Gold Eagle
further agrees not to release any third party from any standstill agreement
or provision to which such third party is a party and to take all required
action to enforce such standstill agreements. Gold Eagle shall immediately
request the return or destruction of all information provided to any third
party that, at any time since December 31, 2006, has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Gold Eagle to the extent that such information
has not previously been returned or destroyed, and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Promptly and, in any event, within 24 hours of the
receipt by any director or officer of Gold Eagle of any Acquisition Proposal,
or any amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public
information relating to Gold Eagle or the Gold Eagle Subsidiary in connection
with any potential Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of Gold Eagle or the Gold Eagle Subsidiary by any person
that informs Gold Eagle or the Gold Eagle Subsidiary that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, Gold Eagle shall
notify Goldcorp thereof, at first orally and then, as soon as possible
thereafter, in writing. Such written notice shall include the identity of the
person(s) making such proposal and all material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and provide such other details of the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or contact as Goldcorp may reasonably request.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If Gold Eagle receives a request for material non-
public information from a person who is considering making or has made a
written Acquisition Proposal (the existence and content of which have been
disclosed to Goldcorp), and the directors of Gold Eagle determine that such ##### 

 

 

37  

     |   |   | proposal could, if consummated in accordance with its
terms, reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal or does
constitute a Superior Proposal then, provided that Gold Eagle has complied
with section 6.01(c), and only in such case, the directors of Gold Eagle may,
subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement on terms that are not
more favourable to the person making or considering making the Acquisition
Proposal than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and which
includes a standstill provision that restricts such person from acquiring, or
publicly announcing an intention to acquire, any securities or assets of Gold
Eagle or the Gold Eagle Subsidiary (other than pursuant to a
Superior Proposal) for a period not less than one year from the date of such
agreement, provide such person with access to information regarding Gold
Eagle; provided, however, that Gold Eagle sends a copy of any such
confidentiality agreement to Goldcorp immediately upon the execution thereof
and Goldcorp is provided with a list of or a copy of the information, if any,
provided to such person that was not previously provided to Goldcorp and
Goldcorp is immediately provided with access to similar information.  
---|---|---|--- 
     
       | (e)  |   | Gold Eagle shall ensure that its officers,
directors, consultants and employees and any financial advisors or other
advisors or representatives retained by Gold Eagle are aware of the
provisions of this section 6.01, and Gold Eagle shall be responsible for any
breach of this section 6.01 by its financial advisors or other advisors
or representatives.  
   

  

6.02 Notice of Superior Proposal Determination 

   

       | (a)  |   | Gold Eagle and the directors of Gold Eagle shall
not make a Change of Gold Eagle Recommendation or accept, approve, recommend
or enter into any agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement and a standstill agreement contemplated by
subsection 6.01(d) hereof) unless (i) Gold Eagle has complied with its
obligations under section 6.01 and the other provisions of this Article 6,
(ii) it has provided Goldcorp with the information about such
Acquisition Proposal as required under subsection 6.01(c); (iii) the
directors of Gold Eagle have determined the Acquisition Proposal would be a
Superior Proposal pursuant to subsection 6.01(a) hereof, and (iv) five (5)
Business Days shall have elapsed from the later of the date Goldcorp received
notice of the determination of the directors of Gold Eagle to accept,
approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such Superior
Proposal and the date Goldcorp received the documents pursuant to
subsection 6.01(c) hereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | During the five Business Days referred to in subsection
6.02(a) hereof, Goldcorp shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation,
to offer in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement.
The directors of Gold Eagle shall review any offer by Goldcorp to amend the
terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement in order to determine in good
faith, as of the later of the dates referred to in subsection 6.02(a)(iv)
hereof, whether the offer of Goldcorp upon acceptance by Gold Eagle would
result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. If the
directors of Gold Eagle so determine, Gold Eagle shall enter into an
amended agreement with Goldcorp reflecting the amended proposal of Goldcorp
and will promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement as
amended.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Gold Eagle acknowledges and agrees that each successive
modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of the requirement under subsection 6.02(a)(iv) hereof
and shall initiate an additional five Business Day period.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If the Proxy Circular has been sent to Gold Eagle
Shareholders prior to the expiry of the five Business Day period set forth in
subsection 6.02(a) and, during such period, Goldcorp requests in writing that
the Gold Eagle Meeting proceed, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, Gold
Eagle shall continue to take all reasonable steps necessary to hold the Gold
Eagle Meeting and to cause the Arrangement to be voted on at the Gold Eagle
Meeting.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Where at any time before the Gold Eagle Meeting, Gold
Eagle has provided Goldcorp with a notice under subsection 6.01(c), an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed or   ##### 

 

 

38  

     |   |   | announced, and the five (5) Business Day period under
subsection 6.02(a) has not elapsed, then, subject to applicable Laws, at
Goldcorps request, Gold Eagle will postpone or adjourn the Gold Eagle
Meeting at the Gold Eagle Meeting (but not beforehand without Goldcorps
consent) to a date acceptable to Goldcorp, acting reasonably, which shall not
be later than ten (10) days after the scheduled date of the Gold Eagle
Meeting and shall, in the event that Goldcorp and Gold Eagle amend the
terms of this Agreement pursuant to subsection 6.02(b), ensure that the
details of such amended Agreement are communicated to the Gold Eagle
Shareholders prior to the resumption of the adjourned Gold Eagle Meeting.

6.03 Termination Fee Event 

   

       |   |   | In the event that (each of the events below being a
"Triggering Event"):

    | (a)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Goldcorp pursuant to
subsection 7.03(c) or (f) hereof;  
      
    | (b)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Goldcorp pursuant to
subsection 7.03(b) hereof due to Gold Eagle having breached its obligations
under subsections 6.01 or 6.02 in a material respect;  
      
    | (c)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Goldcorp pursuant to
subsection 7.03(b) hereof through the fault (whether by commission or

Shareholders, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on or prior to
the date that is five Business Days prior to the Completion Deadline or Gold
Eagle has breached its obligations under section 4.01(b)(iii) hereof;  
      
    | (d)  |   | an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Gold

publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal in respect of
Gold Eagle (a "Pending Gold Eagle Acquisition Proposal") and such Pending
Gold Eagle Acquisition Proposal or announced intention shall not have been
publicly withdrawn prior to the Gold Eagle Meeting and, thereafter, the Gold
Eagle Shareholders do not approve the Arrangement at the Gold Eagle Meeting,
this Agreement is terminated by either Goldcorp or Gold Eagle pursuant to
subsection 7.03(d) or (e) hereof and Gold Eagle completes an Acquisition
Proposal within six months following the termination of this Agreement;

hereof; or

this Agreement or within 30 days of such termination, and, in the
circumstances set forth in subsection 6.03(d) above, within five days
following the completion of such Acquisition Proposal, as consideration
for Goldcorps disposition of rights under this Agreement, an amount in cash
equal to $44,000,000 (the "Gold Eagle Termination Payment"), in immediately
available funds. Gold Eagle shall not be obligated to make more than one
payment pursuant to this section 6.03. Gold Eagle hereby acknowledges that
the Gold Eagle Termination Payment is a payment of liquidated damages which
are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which Goldcorp will suffer or incur
as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant non-
completion of the Arrangement and are not penalties. Gold Eagle hereby
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Upon receipt of payment of the
Gold Eagle Termination Payment by Goldcorp, Goldcorp shall have no further
claim against Gold Eagle in respect of the failure to complete the
Arrangement, provided that nothing herein shall preclude Goldcorp from
seeking injunctive relief to  #####

restrain any breach or threatened breach by Gold Eagle of any of its
obligations hereunder or otherwise to obtain specific performance without the
necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

such amendment, the rights of the parties hereto under sections 5.01, 5.02,
5.03, 6.03 and Article Seven hereof shall remain unaffected. 

   

7.02 Mutual Understanding Regarding Amendments 

   

       | (a)  |   | In addition to the transactions contemplated
hereby or at the request of a party hereto, the parties hereto will continue
from and after the date hereof and through and including the Effective Date
to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to maximize present
and future planning opportunities for Gold Eagle, the Gold Eagle
Shareholders, the Gold Eagle Subsidiary and Goldcorp as and to the extent
that the same shall not prejudice any party hereto or the
shareholders thereof. The parties hereto will ensure that such planning
activities do not impede the progress of the Arrangement in any material
way.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The parties hereto mutually agree that if a party
hereto proposes any other amendment or amendments to this Agreement or to the
Plan of Arrangement, Gold Eagle on the one hand, and Goldcorp on the other
hand, will act reasonably in considering such amendment and if the other of
them and the shareholders thereof are not materially prejudiced by reason of
any such amendment they will co-operate in a reasonable fashion with the
party hereto proposing the amendment so that such amendment can be
effected subject to applicable Laws and the rights of the Gold Eagle
Shareholders.  
      
    | (c)  |   | At any time prior to the Meeting: (i) Gold Eagle and
Goldcorp shall each be entitled to propose to the other modifications to the

the Gold Eagle Options are to be dealt with pursuant to this Agreement or
under the Arrangement in order to take into account the tax planning or other
objectives of the holders of such securities, provided, in each case that:   ##### 

 

 

40  

     |   |   | (A) any such proposal is not likely to materially
prejudice the other party or the Gold Eagle Shareholders, (B) would not
impede or materially delay the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (C) the party making the proposal has provided notice of
such proposal to the other party not less than 15 Business Days prior to the
Meeting Date and (D) implementation of the proposal would not result in a
transaction that is inconsistent with the fundamental terms of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the Cash Consideration and the
Share Consideration.  
---|---|---|--- 
     
       |   |   | Each of Gold Eagle and Goldcorp agree that any such
modifications and any transactions or steps taken in accordance therewith
shall not be considered in determining whether any representation or warranty
made by them under this Agreement has been breached if such modifications,
transactions and steps are the sole cause of such breach.  
      
    |   |   | Gold Eagle and Goldcorp shall enter into an amending
agreement reflecting the proposed amendments to the Arrangement and this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement shall be modified accordingly and Gold
Eagle and Goldcorp shall each use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate any such modifications to the Gold Eagle Shareholders
and to ensure that any such modifications are, to the extent required under
applicable Law, presented to the Gold Eagle Shareholders at the Meeting.

 EFFECT OF ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENT 

   

Section 2.01 _Effect of Arrangement_  

   

 At the Effective Time, the Arrangement shall be binding on Gold Eagle, the Gold Eagle Shareholders, the Gold Eagle Optionholders and Goldcorp. 

   

Section 2.02 _Business Combination Agreement_  

   

 This Plan of Arrangement is made pursuant to, and is subject to the provisions of, the Business Combination Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE THREE 
 ARRANGEMENT 

   

Section 3.01 _The Arrangement_  

   

 At the Effective Time, without any further act or formality, each of the events set out below shall occur and be deemed to occur in the following sequence: 

   

       | (a)  |   | each Gold Eagle Common Share held by a Dissenting
Shareholder shall be deemed to be transferred by the holder thereof, without
any act or formality on its part, free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, to Goldcorp and Goldcorp shall thereupon be obliged to pay the
amount therefore determined and payable in accordance with Article Four
hereof, and the name of such holder shall be removed from the central
securities register as a holder of Gold Eagle Common Shares and Goldcorp
shall be recorded as the registered holder of the Gold Eagle Common Shares so
transferred and shall be deemed to be the legal owner of such Gold Eagle
Common Shares;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | each Gold Eagle Common Share (other than Gold Eagle
Common Shares held by Goldcorp and its Affiliates and the Dissenting
Shareholders) shall be transferred by the holder thereof to Goldcorp (free
and clear of any liens, charges or encumbrances of whatsoever nature), and
each Former Gold Eagle Shareholder (other than Goldcorp and its Affiliates
and the Dissenting Shareholders) shall be entitled to receive, in exchange
therefor and subject to the following provisions of this Section 3.01(b)
and Section 5.05 hereof, consideration comprised of, in accordance with the
election or deemed election of such Former Gold Eagle Shareholder;  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | Cash Consideration  $13.60 for each Gold Eagle
Common Share held; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | Share Consideration 0.292 of a Goldcorp Common Share
and $0.0001 for each Gold Eagle Common Share held; or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | Any combination thereof.  
   

  

       |   |   | For greater certainty, with respect to any election
pursuant to the foregoing, a holder of Gold Eagle Common Shares may elect to
receive a combination of the Cash Consideration and the Share   
---|---|---|--- ##### 

  

  

A-5 

   

      |   |   | Consideration in exchange for the aggregate number of
Gold Eagle Common Shares in respect of which such election is made, _provided
however_ for calculation purposes only, each individual Gold Eagle Common
Share may only be exchanged for either Cash Consideration or Share
Consideration. The maximum amount of Cash Consideration to be paid to holders
of Gold Eagle Shares is an amount determined by multiplying $6.80 by the
number of Gold Eagle Common Shares (excluding Gold Eagle Common Shares held
by Goldcorp immediately prior to the Effective Time) that are issued and
outstanding on the Effective Date (the "Maximum Cash"). The maximum number of
Goldcorp Shares that may be elected by holders of Gold Eagle Shares is the
number of shares determined by multiplying 0.146 by the number of Gold Eagle
Common Shares (excluding Gold Eagle Common Shares held by Goldcorp
immediately prior to the Effective Time) that are issued and outstanding on
the Effective Date (the "Maximum Shares"). In the event that: (x) the
aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration that would, but for this clause,
be paid to Former Gold Eagle Shareholders exceeds the Maximum Cash, then
the Cash Consideration to be paid to any Former Gold Eagle Shareholder who
has elected to receive Cash Consideration shall be determined by multiplying
the total amount of Cash Consideration otherwise payable to such holder by a
fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of which is the
Maximum Cash and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Cash
Consideration otherwise payable to all holders of Gold Eagle Common Shares
who have so elected, and such holder shall be deemed to have elected
to receive Share Consideration for the remainder of their Gold Eagle Common
Shares for which they would otherwise have received Cash Consideration; or
(y) the aggregate number of Goldcorp Shares that would, but for this clause,
be issuable to holders of Gold Eagle Common Shares exceeds the Maximum Shares
then the number of Goldcorp Shares issuable to any holder of Gold Eagle
Common Shares shall, subject to rounding in accordance with Section 3.05, be
determined by multiplying the total number of Goldcorp Shares issuable to
such holder by a fraction, rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of
which is the Maximum Shares and the denominator of which is the number of
Goldcorp Shares otherwise issuable to all electing holders, and such
holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive Cash Consideration for the
remainder of their Gold Eagle Common Shares for which such holder would, but
for this clause, have received Goldcorp Shares;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | any Former Gold Eagle Shareholder who has not
duly and validly completed and delivered the Letter of Transmittal by the
Election Deadline shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Cash
Consideration for 50% of his or her Gold Eagle Common Shares and the Share
Consideration for the remaining 50% of his or her Gold Eagle Common Shares;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | in accordance with the Gold Eagle Stock Option Plan,
including section 3.8 thereof, each holder of a Gold Eagle Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive (and
shall accept), upon the exercise of such holders Gold Eagle Options, for the
same aggregate consideration therefor and in lieu of any Gold Eagle Common
Shares or other consideration, the number of Goldcorp Common Shares which the
holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Plan of Arrangement if, immediately before the Effective
Time, such holder had been the registered holder of the number of Gold Eagle
Common Shares to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon
such exercise and such holder elected to receive the Share Consideration and
each such Gold Eagle Option shall continue to be governed by and be subject
to the terms of the Gold Eagle Share Option Plan and any applicable agreement
thereunder. If the adjustment to the Gold Eagle Options contemplated by this
paragraph results in a disposition of Gold Eagle Options for options to
acquire Goldcorp Common Shares or "new" Gold Eagle Options, it is intended
that the provisions of subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act apply to any such
disposition. Therefore, in the event that the Goldcorp Stock Option In-The-
Money Amount in respect of a Gold Eagle Option exceeds the Gold Eagle Stock
Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the Gold Eagle Option, the number of
Goldcorp Common Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the Gold
Eagle Option at and after the Effective Time will be adjusted accordingly
with effect at and from the Effective Time to ensure that the Goldcorp Stock
Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the Gold Eagle Option does not
exceed the Gold Eagle Stock Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the Gold
Eagle Option and the ratio of the amount payable to acquire such shares to
the value of such shares to be acquired shall be unchanged;  ##### 

  

  

A-6 

   

     

  

       | (e)  |   | with respect to each Gold Eagle Common Share
(other than Gold Eagle Common Shares held by Goldcorp and its Affiliates):  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | each Former Gold Eagle Shareholder shall cease to
be the Holder of such share and such Holders name shall be removed from the
register of Gold Eagle Common Shares with respect to such Gold Eagle Common
Shares as of the Effective Date; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | Goldcorp shall, and shall be deemed to be, the
transferee of such share (free and clear of any Liens) and shall be entered
in the register of Gold Eagle Common Shares as the holder thereof as at the
Effective Time;  
   

  

       | (f)  |   | Gold Eagle will file an election with the Canada
Revenue Agency to cease to be a public corporation for the purposes of the
Tax Act.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

Section 3.02 _Election_  

   

       | (a)  |   | The initial election date (the "Initial Election
Date") shall be [l], 2008, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Goldcorp and
Gold Eagle. If, after the Letter of Transmittal has been mailed, Goldcorp and
Gold Eagle determine that the Effective Date is not reasonably likely to
occur by the tenth Business Day after the Initial Election Date, then the
date by which Letters of Transmittal must be received shall be extended to a
date which the parties expect to be not more than 10 Business Days before the
Effective Date. In the event that the date by which Letters of Transmittal
must be received is extended, Gold Eagle shall provide at least 5 days notice
of the new Election Date (and shall provide such notice prior to the
Initial Election Date if practicable) to holders of Gold Eagle Common Shares
by means of publication, at least once, in The Globe and Mail; national
edition, or any other English language daily newspaper of general circulation
in Canada. Any duly completed Letter of Transmittal deposited by the Election
Deadline on the Initial Election Date shall not be required to be re-
deposited if the date by which Letters of Transmittal must be received is
extended pursuant hereto. The Initial Election Date, as extended and
published pursuant to the terms hereof, shall be the "Election Date.  
---|---|---|---

21 days prior to the Initial Election Date to each holder of record of Gold
Eagle Common Shares.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Each Person who, at or prior to the Election Deadline,
is a holder of record of Gold Eagle Common Shares will be entitled, with
respect to all or a portion of their shares, to make an election at or prior
to the Election Deadline to receive (i) the Cash Consideration, or (ii) the
Share Consideration, in exchange for such holders Gold Eagle Common Shares
on the basis set forth herein and in the Letter of Transmittal.  
   

  

Section 3.03 _Methods of Election_  

   

       |   | The election contemplated by Sections 3.01(b) and 3.02
shall be made as follows:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | each Former Gold Eagle Shareholder shall make
such election by depositing with the Depositary by the Election Deadline an
irrevocable Letter of Transmittal duly signed and completed in accordance
with the provisions thereof, indicating such Former Gold Eagle Shareholders
election, together with the certificates representing such Former Gold Eagle
Shareholders Gold Eagle Common Shares;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | any Letter of Transmittal once so deposited with the
Depositary shall be irrevocable and may not be withdrawn by the Former Gold
Eagle Shareholders;  
      
    | (c)  |   | any Former Gold Eagle Shareholder who does not deposit
with the Depositary a duly completed Letter of Transmittal together with the
certificates representing such Former Gold Eagle Shareholders Gold Eagle
Common Shares prior to the Election Deadline or otherwise fails to fully
comply with the requirements of paragraph 3.03(a), (including any Former Gold
Eagle Shareholders who attempts to  #####

50% of his Gold Eagle Common Shares and the Share Consideration for the
remaining 50% of his Gold Eagle Common Shares;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | any deposit of a Letter of Transmittal and accompanying

    | (e)  |   | a Former Gold Eagle Shareholder who holds Gold Eagle

Date, for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the failure of an
Eligible Holder to properly complete or file such election forms in the form
and manner and within the time prescribed by the Tax Act (or any
applicable provincial legislation). In its sole discretion, Goldcorp or any
successor corporation may choose to sign and return an election form received
by it more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but will have no
obligation to do so.

Section 5.04 _Withholding Rights_  

   

 Goldcorp and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from all dividends or other distributions otherwise payable to any Former Gold Eagle Shareholder or Gold Eagle Optionholder such amounts as Goldcorp or the Depositary is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the United States _Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ or any provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law or treaty, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Former Gold Eagle Shareholder or Gold Eagle Optionholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
