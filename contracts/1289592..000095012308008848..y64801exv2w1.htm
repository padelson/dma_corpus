 WHEREAS, the Special Committee of Company and the Board of Directors of Company have adopted this Agreement, authorized and approved the merger and amalgamation of Company with and into Merger Sub upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the " _Merger_ "), and deem it fair to, advisable to and in the best interests of Company to consummate this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Special Committee of Parent and the Board of Directors of Parent have approved and adopted this Agreement, authorized and approved the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the " _Share Issuance_ "), and deem it fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Parent to consummate this Agreement and the Share Issuance;

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1. _The Merger; Effective Time_ _._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Merger Sub and Company will cause ( _a_ ) a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly prepared, executed and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing, as provided in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (" _DGCL_ ") on the Closing Date, and ( _b_ ) a notice of amalgamation to be prepared, executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") as provided under S.104C of the Companies Act prior to the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time thereafter as may be mutually agreed by Parent and Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "); _provided_  that the Certificate of Merger shall be filed by the Surviving Company with the Registrar within 30 days after the date of issue thereof in accordance with S.104C of the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been adopted when it has been approved by the stockholders of each of Company and Merger Sub. 

  

 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is the sixth trading day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), but under no circumstances before December 2, 2008, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties; _provided_ that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to effect the Closing prior to the third business day immediately following the last day on which the holders of Company Common Shares can require appraisal of their Company Common Shares pursuant to Bermuda law. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, in New York, New York, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties. 

  

 1.3. _Effects of the Merger_ _._ At the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company shall be merged, and amalgamated, with and into Merger Sub and the separate existence of Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. As used in this Agreement, " _Surviving Company_ " shall mean Merger Sub, at and after the Effective Time, as the surviving corporation in the Merger. The parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of Bermuda law ( _i_ ) the Merger shall be effected so as to constitute an "amalgamation" in accordance with S.104B of the Companies Act, and ( _ii_ ) the Surviving Company shall be deemed to be an "amalgamated company" and "amalgamated corporation" as such term is defined under the Companies Act. 

  

 1.4. _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by the DGCL. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub, in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein, or by the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company or the DGCL. 

  

 1.5. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The names and addresses of such directors are set forth in Section 1.5 of the Parent Disclosure Letter. The officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 CONVERSION OF COMPANY SECURITIES; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

 2.1. _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares in the share capital of Company, each having a par value of $0.01 (each, a " _Company Common Share_ "), as evidenced by way of entry in the register of shareholders of Company (the " _Company Share Register_ ") or by share certificates registered in the name of the bearer (each, a " _Company Certificate_ "): 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Restricted Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, as determined in accordance with this Section 2.1(a), and an amount in cash equal to $1.83, subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 7.1(h) (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and together with the Exchange Ratio and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e), the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall equal: 

   

 (i) 0.47, if the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal to $20.00 and less than or equal to $26.00; 

   

 (ii) if the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than $26.00, that fraction (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $12.22 by the Average Parent Stock Price; 

   

 (iii) if the Average Parent Stock Price is greater than or equal to $17.50 and less than $20.00, that fraction (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $9.40 by the Average Parent Stock Price; 

   

 (iv) 0.5371, if the Average Parent Stock Price is less than $17.50; or 

   

 (v) if Parent shall have given a Top-Up Notice pursuant to Section 7.1(h), the Exchange Ratio shall be as set forth in such notice pursuant to Section 7.1(h). 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Average Parent Stock Price_ " means the volume weighted average price per
share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if
not reported thereby, by another authoritative source mutually agreed by the
parties) for the 15 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the fifth
trading day prior to the Closing Date (" _Reference Period_ "). The Average
Parent Stock Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one
cent. Upon such conversion, each Company Common Share shall be cancelled and
each holder of such shares registered in the Company Share Register or
holding a valid Company Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Ratio and
the Cash Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Shares having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Securities_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all Company Common Shares that are owned by Parent or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

  

 (c) _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Company Common Shares held by a person who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who complies with all the provisions of the Companies Act concerning the right of holders of Company Common Shares to require appraisal of their Company Common Shares pursuant to Bermuda law (such shareholder, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ", and such shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1(a), but shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Companies Act. In the event that a Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal, its Company Common Shares shall be deemed to be cancelled and converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Dissenting Share, without interest. Company shall give Parent ( _i_ ) prompt notice of ( _A_ ) any written demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or withdrawals of such demands received by Company and ( _B_ ) to the extent that Company has actual knowledge, any attempted applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares, and ( _ii_ ) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. 

  

 (d) _Effect of Amalgamation under Companies Act_. Under the Companies Act, as from the Effective Time: ( _i_ ) the Merger of Company and Merger Sub and their continuance as 

   ##### 

  

    

one company shall become effective; ( _ii_ ) the property of each of Company
and Merger Sub shall become the property of Surviving Company; ( _iii_ )
Surviving Company shall continue to be liable for the obligations and
liabilities of Company and Merger Sub; ( _iv_ ) any existing cause of action,
claim or liability to prosecution shall be unaffected; ( _v_ ) a civil,
criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by or against Company
or Merger Sub may be continued to be prosecuted by or against Surviving
Company; and ( _vi_ ) a conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in
favor of or against, Company or Merger Sub may be enforced by or against
Surviving Company. 

  

 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Company Common Shares held by the shareholders of Company. At or as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article II, separate and apart from the Exchange Agents other funds, certificates, or at Parents option, shares in book entry form representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged in the Merger, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions to which the shareholders of Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Such Merger Consideration and cash so deposited, together with any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c), are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Company Certificates on cash amounts payable upon the surrender of such certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, to each shareholder of Company, ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Common Shares shall pass, upon delivery of the Company Certificates, to the extent available and in issue, to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the parties may reasonably specify) and, where applicable, ( _ii_ ) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates, to the extent available and in issue, in exchange for the Merger Consideration. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to the Company Common Shares previously held by a shareholder of Company in accordance with this Section 2.2, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, such shareholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, which such shareholder has the right to receive in respect of the surrender of title to the Company Common Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and any Company Certificate surrendered in respect thereof shall forthwith be marked as cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such Company Common Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents 

   ##### 

  

    

required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any shareholder of Company holding any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, nor shall the Cash Consideration or cash payment in lieu of fractional shares be paid to any such shareholder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until a shareholder of Company holding any Company Certificate shall surrender such Company Certificate in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following the surrender of any such Company Certificate in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, a shareholder of Company holding such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the consideration set forth in Section 2.1, without interest, ( _i_ ) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock which a shareholder of Company holding such Company Certificate is entitled to receive hereunder, and ( _ii_ ) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock which a shareholder of Company holding such Company Certificate is entitled to receive hereunder. 

  

 (d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid or issued upon the surrender of title to Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shareholders of Company. There shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Company Common Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be marked as cancelled and exchanged in accordance with this Article II, except as otherwise provided by law. 

  

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger, and in lieu thereof any shareholder of Company who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, upon surrender of title to Company Common Shares for exchange, shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into account and aggregating Company Common Shares represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such holder, or as set out in the Company Share Register, as applicable) cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying ( _i_ ) the fractional share interest to which such shareholder (after taking into account and aggregating all Company Common Shares represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such shareholder or as set out in the Company Share Register, as applicable) would otherwise be entitled by ( _ii_ ) the Average Parent Stock Price. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as may be required pursuant to this Article II in respect of the Company Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates; _provided_ that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment, as applicable, of their claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder of Company for any Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (i) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any shareholder of Company such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The parties agree to cooperate with each other for purposes of determining whether any taxes are required to be withheld with respect to the Merger. 

  

 2.3. _Company Options and Other Company Share Awards_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each unexercised and outstanding option to purchase Company Common Shares (a " _Company Share Option_ "), issued pursuant to any Company Share Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent, shall cease to represent a right to acquire Company Common Shares and shall automatically be converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share), with an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest whole cent) equal to ( _x_ ) the per share exercise price of the Company Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by ( _y_ ) the Option 

   ##### 

  

    

Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise
price and number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which each Company
Share Option is exercisable shall ( _i_ ) in the case of any Company Share
Option which is intended to be an "incentive stock option" under Section 422
of the Code, be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code and ( _ii_ ) in the case of any Company Share
Option which is not intended to be an "incentive stock option", be determined
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code;
_provided_ _further_ that such options will otherwise have the same terms and
conditions (including vesting dates, expiration date and exercise periods) as
were in effect with respect to the corresponding Company Share Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time. " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " means a
fraction, the numerator of which is the per share cash value of the Merger
Consideration (valuing the stock portion of such consideration based on the
volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ (as
reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported thereby, by another
authoritative source mutually agreed by the parties) for the 5 consecutive
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date) and the denominator of
which is the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock
on NASDAQ (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported thereby, by
another authoritative source mutually agreed by the parties) for the 5
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company Common Share granted pursuant to any Company Share Plan that is subject to vesting or other restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be converted into Parent Common Stock at the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share); _provided_ that such converted shares of Parent Common Stock shall remain subject to the same restrictions that applied to the Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions (including vesting dates) as were in effect with respect to the corresponding Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be reduced by any required withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 2.2(i) and shall be paid without interest. 

  

 (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Company Share Options and vesting of Company Restricted Shares in accordance with this Section 2.3. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to Parent Common Stock subject to the Company Share Options and Company Restricted Shares, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus required thereunder) for so long as any Company Share Plan remains in effect and such registration of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to be required. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Share Options and Company Restricted Shares appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to any Company Share Plan and agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Share Options and Company Restricted Shares, and stating that the Company Share Plans and such Company Share Options and Company Restricted Shares and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Company Share Plans). 

  

 2.4. _Cancellation of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, all warrants held by Parent or any of its subsidiaries to purchase Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

  

 2.5. _Qualified Stock Purchase_. The parties intend that all of the outstanding shares of CastlePoint Bermuda Holdings, Ltd., a Bermuda company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Company (" _CP Bermuda_ "), will be transferred to Merger Sub by virtue of the Merger and that such transfer will constitute a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

   ##### 

  

    

Two-Year Extension, such party shall do so by written notice to the other
party no later than 90 days prior to the commencement of such one-year
period. The Expert, acting as expert, will, in its sole and absolute
discretion, utilizing such methodologies and processes as it shall

determination with respect to arms-length, fair market pricing terms and
conditions of the Reinsurance Agreements for the one-year period in question.
The determination by the Expert shall be final, binding and conclusive on
both Company and Parent. Company and Parent shall each pay the fees
and disbursements of their respective internal personnel and independent
advisors incurred in connection with the procedures contemplated by this
Section 7.5. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be borne
50% percent by Company, on the one hand, and 50% percent by Parent, on the
other hand. The parties shall instruct the Expert to render its determination
as soon as reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree should be not
later than 45 days following the day on which the Expert is appointed).

This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when each of the parties has delivered a signed counterpart to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. Such counterpart executions may be transmitted to the parties by facsimile or electronic transmission, which shall have the full force and effect of an original signature. 

  

 8.5. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) ( _a_ ) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreements, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than the seventh paragraph thereof (contact with third parties) and the ninth paragraph thereof (standstill), which paragraphs shall terminate and cease to have any effect as of the date hereof) and ( _b_ ) except as provided in Section 5.9(d), is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 8.6. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws, to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and would permit or require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent that, in the case of Company, Bermuda law is applicable. 

  

 8.7. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

 8.8. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 8.9. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court identified in the Section above, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 8.10. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of ( _a_ ) the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or ( _b_ ) the courts of the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto either in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or, if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in the courts of the State of Delaware. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Chosen Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any such dispute and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 

  

 8.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
