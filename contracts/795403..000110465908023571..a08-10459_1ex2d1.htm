Third party claims

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

13.3.1

    |  



    |  

In the event any third party asserts any claim,  based on which a Claim is
notified to the Seller, the Seller shall have the  right, at its election,
risk and expense, to control the defence of such  third party claim by giving
notice within 60 days from the date of the Claim  having been notified to the
Seller and against the Seller indemnifying the  Buyer for all relevant costs
and any and all Losses arising out of the  proceedings.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

13.3.2

    |  



    |  

If the Seller in accordance with 13.3.1 takes over  the defence the Buyer
shall cause the relevant Group Company to provide  reasonable co-operation
with the Seller and with any counsel appointed by the  Seller. The Buyer
shall cause that such third party claims and any  counterclaims are not
settled and that no liability is admitted without the prior  written consent
of the Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

13.3.3

    |  



    |  



    
     

13.4.1

    |  



    |  

Losses for which the Buyer has claimed  indemnification from the Seller
(Loss/Losses) shall be calculated in  accordance with the following
principles and otherwise in accordance with  applicable Danish law:

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  



    |  

 1. The net  present value of any tax benefit to or saving by the Buyer Group shall be  deducted when calculating the Loss.

    
   



        
   

  



       



    |  

2.

    |  



    |  

The amount of any compensation or other recovery  (including, without
limitation, insurance proceeds) actually paid or payable  to the Buyer Group
by a third party shall be deducted when calculating the  Loss. If the Seller
has settled a Loss, and a Buyer Group Company  subsequently recovers any
payment or compensation with respect to such Loss,  the Buyer shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Seller the amount so  recovered, inclusive of
Interest from the date on which the Buyer Group  Company received such
payment or compensation.

    
---|---|---|--- 
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

3.

    |  



    |  

The occurrence or increase of a Loss, which is the  direct or indirect
consequence of any change in any law or accounting  principles adopted or
implemented subsequent to the Closing Date, shall be  disregarded.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

4.

    |  



    |  

The occurrence or increase of a Loss, which is the  direct or indirect result
of any act or omission taken after the Closing Date  by a Buyer Group Company
or any third party of whom a Buyer Group Company is,  directly or indirectly,
in control, shall be disregarded.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

5.

    |  



    |  

Only direct Losses shall be eligible for  indemnification. Consequently, the
Seller shall not be liable for any  indirect or consequential Losses,
including Loss of profits or goodwill.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

6.

    |  



    |  

The Loss shall be indemnified on a DKK-by-DKK basis.  Thus, for instance no
multiples that may have been applied by the Buyer for  the purpose of
establishing the commercial basis for the transactions  provided for herein
shall be taken into consideration.

    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

7.

    |  



    |  

No Loss shall be deemed to have been suffered to the  extent that a provision
regarding the subject matter of the Claim has been made  in the Accounts or
the Interim Accounts;

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

8.

    |  



    |  

To the extent that a Loss that would otherwise have  been claimable against
the Seller has been accounted for in favour of the  Buyer when calculating
the Final Net Debt or the Final Working Capital Adjustment  Amount, such Loss
shall be disregarded;

    
     



    |  



    |  



    |  



    
     



    |  

9.

    |  



    |  

When calculating whether or not a Loss exceeds the  thresholds in Clause
13.5.1, Losses sustained in foreign currencies shall be  converted into DKK
at the time when the Claim is made;

    
   



         
 

  



       

13.4.2

    |  



    |  

Any payment by the Seller to the Buyer as a result  of a Claim shall be
regarded as a reduction of the Final Purchase Price (a  DKK for DKK reduction
of the Final Purchase Price).

    |  



    |  



    
     

13.4.3

    |  



    |  

If any Claim shall arise by reason of a liability,  which, at the time that
the Claim is notified to the Indemnifying Party, is  contingent (whatever the
cause), the Indemnifying Party shall not be under  any obligation to make any
payment to the Indemnified Party until such time  as such liability ceases to
be contingent.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

13.4.4

    |  



    |  

The amount of any Loss shall accrue Interest  according to Danish Law.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

13.4.5

    |  



    |  

Each Party is obliged to use all reasonable efforts  to mitigate its Losses.

    
     



    |  



    |  



    
     

13.4.6

    |  



    |  

In the event of a Claim in respect of a matter which  in the Buyers
reasonable opinion is capable of cure, the Seller shall have  the right,
exercisable upon written notice from the Buyer, to attempt to cure  within a
reasonable period of time and in no event later than 30 days after  dispatch
of the written notice to the Seller the matter resulting in the  Claim.

objections to the Tax return. If the  Buyer has any objections, the Buyer and
the Seller with the assistance of the  Companys auditor shall solve the
dispute within 30 (thirty) Business Days.  Possible disagreements between the
Parties concerning the Tax return, which cannot  be settled amicably, must be
finally settled with binding effect by the  Independant Accountant.
Furthermore, the Company shall file a Tax return for  the time period from
the Closing Date until 31 December 2008, or any  other date, as shall be
applicable for the Company after the Closing date  pursuant to the Danish
joint Taxation rules. The Seller and the Company shall  keep a copy of all
relevant documents concerning the joint Taxation, which  the relevant Tax
authorities may request for a period of 6 years after the  Closing Date.

The Parties agree that in the event the Danish tax  authorities find that the
control of the Company for the purposes of the  Danish joint taxation is
transferred from the Seller to the Buyer as of a  date other than the Closing
Date (the "Change-of-Control Date"), the  payments, plus additions,
prescribed in section 31, subsection 6 of the  Danish Act on Company Taxation
(in Danish: "Selskabsskatteloven") regarding  the income year 2008 shall be
recalculated on the basis of the taxable income  as of the Change-of-Control
Date. Furthermore, the Parties agree

    
   



        
   

  



       



    |  



    |  

that any additional payments or repayments, plus  additions, necessary under
section 31, subsection 6 of the Danish Act on  Company Taxation (in Danish:
"Selskabsskatteloven"), as a result of such  recalculation shall be effected
no later than 45 Business Days after the  expiry of the period allowed for
appeal of the decision made by the Danish  tax authorities. Each Party shall
be entitled to appeal the decision of the  Danish tax authorities, it being
understood that any additional payments or  repayments, plus additions,
necessary under section 31, subsection 6 of the  Danish Act on Company
Taxation (in Danish: "Selskabsskatteloven") as a result  of the recalculation
in such case shall be effected no later than 90 Working  Days after the
appeal has been finally settled. In the event of such appeal  the appealing
Party shall indemnify the other Party for any and all losses  and/or costs
incurred by the other Party as a result of the appeal (including  without
limitation any and all costs and/or penalties incurred as a result of 
delayed payment of Taxes). The provisions in Clauses 16.4 - 16.5 shall apply 
mutatis mutandis.

    |  



    |  

The obligations set out in Clause 17.1 shall not apply  to a Personal
Shareholder if the Company terminates the employment of such  Personal
Shareholder and such termination is not due to any breach on the  part of the

Company choses to pay the Personal Shareholder his fixed  remuneration
according to his employment agreement for the period in which  the obligation
shall apply.

250,000.00 unless the general rules of Danish law  provide for a higher
amount of damages. If any breach of the obligations set  out in Clause 17.1
is pending for a period of more than two weeks, such  continued breach shall
be deemed to constitute a new and separate breach,  which shall entitle the
Buyer to payment of additional penalties of each DKK  250,000.00 for each
period of two weeks such continuous breach is ongoing.  Any payment of a
penalty shall not exempt the Personal Shareholder from their  obligations
under Clause 17.1. The Buyer shall further be entitled to apply  for
