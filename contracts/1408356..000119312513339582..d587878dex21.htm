necessary or appropriate to effect a conveyance of the Acquired Assets and an
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in the jurisdictions in which such

Property, separate assignments as may be required by the landlord thereunder
or reasonably requested by any Party. Such transfer and assumption agreements
shall be jointly prepared by Buyer and the Sellers and shall include, the Bill
of Sale, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the IP Assignment
Agreements, which shall be executed no later than at or as of the Closing by
the Sellers and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, and Buyer
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate.

(b) To the extent any Transferred Technology that is not Shared Technology is
needed by Sellers to provide Services under the Transition Services Agreement,
Sellers may retain such copies of such Technology as may be necessary and for
so long as required to provide such services to Buyer (and, without limiting
_Section 11.1_), may also retain copies existing in back-up and archival
systems until purged in the regular course of business). Sellers may retain
copies of the Prospect DB to exercise the license rights under Section 4
hereof.

(c) From time to time following the Closing, the Sellers and Buyer shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver
all such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquittances
and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be
necessary or appropriate to fully and effectively transfer, assign and convey
to Acquisition Sub and its successors or assigns, all of the properties,
rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and privileges intended
to be conveyed to Acquisition Sub under this Agreement and to fully and
effectively transfer, assign and convey to Acquisition Sub and its successors
and assigns, the Assumed Liabilities intended to be assumed by Acquisition
Sub under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby and to confirm the right, title or interest of Acquisition
Sub in the Acquired Assets, to put Acquisition Sub in actual possession and
operating control thereof and to assist Acquisition Sub in exercising all
rights with respect thereto, including (i) transferring and/or delivering back
to the Sellers and its Subsidiaries any asset or Liability not contemplated by
this Agreement to be an Acquired Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively,
which asset or Liability was transferred and/or delivered to Acquisition Sub
at Closing, and (ii) transferring and/or delivering to Acquisition Sub any
asset or Liability contemplated by this Agreement to be an Acquired Asset or
an Assumed Liability, respectively, which was not transferred and/or delivered
to Acquisition Sub at Closing.

(d) If after the Closing it is determined that any material Acquired Asset
that falls within the definition of an "Acquired Asset", was not delivered to
Buyer, the Sellers shall promptly, without payment

 



-19-   of further consideration by Buyer, transfer and assign such asset to
Acquisition Sub, which assignment shall be deemed to have been effective as of
the Closing. If after the Closing it is determined that any Transferred
Technology or other material was delivered to Buyer but was used by the
retained businesses prior to Closing, the Buyer shall promptly provide a copy
of the requested item to Sellers for their ongoing businesses; provided that
the Sellers pay any cost incurred by Buyer in accomplishing the foregoing.

2.6 _Non-Assignable Assets_. 

(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to sell,
transfer, assign, convey or deliver any asset, property or right to
Acquisition Sub ( _provided_ , that this _Section 2.6(a)_ shall not affect
whether any asset, property or right shall be deemed to be an Acquired Asset
for any other purpose under this Agreement) or for Acquisition Sub and its
respective successors and assigns to assume any Assumed Liability which by its
terms or by Law is not transferable or nonassignable, as applicable, without
the consent or waiver of a third party or is cancelable by a third party in
the event of such a transfer or assignment without the consent or waiver of
such third party, in each case unless and until such consent or waiver shall
have been obtained (collectively, " _Non-Assignable Assets_ ").

(b) Each Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any
consent or waiver that is required for such Seller and its Subsidiaries to
sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver the Acquired Assets to Acquisition
Sub pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in
the event any such consent or waiver cannot be obtained prior to Closing, (i)
the Non-Assignable Assets subject thereto and affected thereby shall be held,
as of and from the Closing, by such Seller in trust for the benefit of
Acquisition Sub, and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be
for Acquisition Subs account, (ii) Acquisition Sub shall pay, perform or
otherwise discharge (in accordance with the respective terms and subject to
the respective conditions thereof, and in the name of Seller) all of the
covenants and obligations of such Seller incurred after the Closing with
respect to such Non-Assignable Asset, (iii) such Seller shall take or cause
to be taken at its own expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer
may reasonably request so as to provide Acquisition Sub with the benefits of
such Non-Assignable Assets and to effect the collection of money or other
consideration that becomes due and payable under such Non-Assignable Assets,
and promptly pay over to Acquisition Sub all money or other consideration
received by it in respect of such Non-Assignable Assets, and (iv) Buyer and
such Seller shall mutually cooperate to provide any other alternative
arrangements as may be reasonably required to implement the purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. If and when such consent or
waiver is obtained, such Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver such Non-Assignable Asset to
Acquisition Sub for no additional consideration.

 

(c) As of and from the Closing Date, each Seller authorizes (and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to authorize) Acquisition Sub, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Assets, at
Acquisition Subs expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the
benefits of such Seller and its Subsidiaries under the Non-Assignable
Assets. 

2.7 _Shared Contracts_.

(a) _Schedule 2.7(a)_ sets forth a list of all Shared Contracts, indicating
which of such Shared Contracts may be assigned in part, pursuant to its terms,
without the consent of the counterparty thereto or other conditions,
including the payment of a transfer or other fee (the " _Assignable Shared
Contracts_ "). Within seven (7) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, Buyer will provide the Sellers with written notice of those
Assignable Shared Contracts that Buyer desires Acquisition Sub to assume in
part. Each such Assignable Shared Contract for which Buyer provides written
notice of its desire to assume in part shall thereafter be deemed to be
a Transferred Contract hereunder with respect to the portion thereof assumed
by Acquisition Sub and the Seller party to such contract shall, or shall cause
one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, assign such assumed
portion to Acquisition Sub as of the Closing in accordance with the terms of
such Assignable Shared Contract.

 



-20-  (b) With respect to each Shared Contract identified on _Schedule 2.7(a)_ that
is not an Assignable Shared Contract (the " _Non-Assignable Shared Contracts_
"), Buyer will also, within seven (7) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, provide the Sellers with written notice of those Non-
Assignable Shared Contracts that Buyer desires Acquisition Sub to assume in
part. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts prior to the
Closing Date to cause the counterparty to each such Non-Assignable Shared
Contract to consent to the partial assignment of such Non-Assignable Shared
Contract to Acquisition Sub, or to otherwise enter into a new Contract with
Acquisition Sub on substantially the same terms as exist under the applicable
Shared Contract, in each case as of the Closing. Each such Non-Assignable
Shared Contract for which the parties have received consent to the partial
assignment shall thereafter be deemed to be a Transferred Contract hereunder
to the extent of the assigned portion and the Seller party to such
contract shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to, partially assign to Acquisition Sub as of the Closing such
Contract in accordance with its terms. The Sellers shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action to terminate prior to its
expiration any Non-Assignable Shared Contract that is a Material Contract and
which has been identified by Buyer as one it desires to assume pursuant to
this subsection (b) (and for which an alternative, reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, to such contract has not already been implemented by the Parties), or
knowingly take any action or fail to take any action that would permit the
other party to any such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to terminate prior to
its expiration such Shared Contract, in each case, prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (and provided that the foregoing
shall not obligate a Seller or a Subsidiary to renew a contract after its
then current term or prohibit it from terminating such contract for material
breach, bankruptcy of the counterparty or other conditions of force majeure;
_provided_ , _however_ , a Seller or a Subsidiary shall notify Buyer in
writing at least thirty (30) days prior to any such expiration or termination
and the Parties will reasonably and in good faith discuss what course of
action best accommodates the interests of the Parties with respect to such
contracts in light of the expiration or proposed termination, including the
interest of Buyer in continuing to operate the Business, provided that during
such period the Sellers shall not permit such Contract to lapse or terminate
absent such agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not
be required to partially assign to Acquisition Sub at Closing any of the Non-
Assignable Shared Contracts for which consent has not been obtained.

 

(c) With respect to each Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the
arrangements described in _Section 2.7(b)_ were not entered into prior to
the Closing Date, the Sellers agree to continue to use their commercially
reasonable efforts from and after the Closing Date to cause the counterparty
to each such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to consent to the
partial assignment of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to Acquisition Sub,
or to otherwise enter into a new Contract with Acquisition Sub or one or more
of its Subsidiaries on substantially the same terms as exist under the
applicable Shared Contract. Until any such consent or new Contract is
obtained the Sellers and Buyer will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate, in any lawful and reasonable arrangement, to
the extent such cooperation would not result in a breach of the terms of such
Non-Assignable Shared Contract, and not prohibited under applicable law, which
will provide Acquisition Sub the obligations and benefits of any such Non-
Assignable Shared Contract with respect to the Business,
including subcontracting, licensing, sublicensing, leasing or subleasing to
Buyer and its Subsidiaries any or all of such Sellers and its Subsidiaries
rights and obligations with respect to such Non-Assignable Shared Contract
with respect to the Business. In any such arrangement, Acquisition Sub will
(i) bear the sole responsibility for completion of the work or provision of
goods and services, (ii) bear all Taxes with respect thereto or arising
therefrom to the extent attributable to any period or portion thereof
beginning after the Closing Date, (iii) be solely entitled to all benefits
thereof, economic or otherwise, (iv) be solely responsible for any warranty or
breach thereof, any repurchase, indemnity and service obligations thereof,
and (v) promptly reimburse the reasonable costs and expenses of the Sellers
and their Affiliates related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Acquisition Subs obligations under clauses (i) through (v) shall be limited
to that portion of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract that Buyer has notified
the Sellers pursuant to the first sentence of _Section 2.7(b)_ that it

the year-end balance sheets of PES as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the
interim balance sheet of PES as of May 31, 2013, and the related statements of
operations, changes in members (net deficit) capital, and cash flows for the

material respects and present fairly the financial position of the Business as
of the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows
of the Business for the periods covered thereby. The Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered, subject, in the case of the interim Financial
Statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of notes.

(b) The Books and Records and accounts of each Seller and its Subsidiaries
accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the transactions in and
dispositions of the assets used in or held for use in the operation of the
Business. The systems of internal accounting controls maintained by each
Seller and its Subsidiaries that are used in, or held for use in, the
operation of the Business are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that:
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization, and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any directors,
managers or executive officers of such Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) nor
such Sellers independent accountants has identified or been made aware of (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by such Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that
are used in, or held for use in, the operation of the Business, (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management of such Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries or any employees of such Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries who have a role in the preparation of financial statements of the
Business or the internal accounting controls utilized by such Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries that are used in, or held for use in, for the operation of
the Business, or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing,
in each case other than has been fully and finally resolved.

 

(c) No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has Liabilities that arise from the
operation or conduct of, or are otherwise allocated to, the Business, whether
or not required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, except liabilities which individually or in the aggregate (i) have been
reflected in the Balance Sheet or disclosed in the notes thereto (to
the extent of such reflection or disclosure), (ii) have arisen in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices since the Reference
Date and are not material, or (iii) are executory obligations under
Transferred Contracts arising in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice (and not as a result of breach or default thereunder).

 

(d) No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Indebtedness incurred from
the operation or conduct of, or otherwise allocated to, the Business.

5.6 _Absence of Changes_. Since the Reference Date:

 

(a) there has not occurred a Business Material Adverse Effect or any change,
fact, circumstance, condition, event or effect, or combination of changes,
facts, circumstances, conditions, events, or effects, that individually or in
the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect;

 

(b) there has not been any material Loss, damage or destruction to, or any
material interruption in the use of, any of the assets of a Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries used in, held for use in, the operation of the Business
(whether or not covered by insurance); and

 



-32-  (c) no Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would be
prohibited by the terms of _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ if proposed to be
taken after the date of this Agreement.

5.7  _Taxes_.

(a) All required U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. Tax Returns relating
to the Acquired Assets or the Business have been timely filed, and such Tax
Returns are true and correct in all material respects and have been completed
in accordance with applicable Law.

(b) All Taxes required to be paid with respect to the Acquired Assets or the
Business (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid. All
U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income taxes, Federal Insurance
Contribution Act amounts, Federal Unemployment Tax Act amounts, and other
Taxes required to be paid or withheld with respect to employees and other
third parties relating to the Acquired Assets or the Business have
been timely paid or withheld (and withheld amounts have been timely paid over
to the appropriate Taxing Authority). As of the Reference Date, there were no
material liabilities for unpaid Taxes concerning or attributable to the
Acquired Assets or the Business that had not been accrued or reserved on the
Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP, and since the Reference Date no
material liability has been incurred for such Taxes other than in the ordinary
course of business). There are no Liens for Taxes upon the Acquired Assets,
except for Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable. To Sellers Knowledge,
there is not any reasonable basis for the assertion of any claim relating or
attributable to Taxes which, if adversely determined, would result in any
Lien on the Acquired Assets or otherwise adversely affect the use or ownership
by Buyer or its Affiliates of the Acquired Assets or their operation of the
Business, or for which Buyer or its Affiliates could become liable as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) There is no outstanding, assessed, or to Sellers Knowledge proposed
deficiency for Taxes concerning or attributable to the Business or the
Acquired Assets, nor has any outstanding waiver of any statute of limitations
on or extension of the period for the assessment or collection of any Tax
concerning or attributable to the Business or the Acquired Assets been
executed by a Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or requested of a Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) None of the Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries has been notified in
writing of any request for an audit, examination or proceeding with respect to
any Tax Return or Taxes concerning or attributable to the Business or the

proceeding presently in progress. No adjustment relating to any Tax Return or
Taxes concerning or attributable to the Business or the Acquired Assets has
been proposed in writing by any Taxing Authority and received by a Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries. No written claim has ever been received by a Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries that the Acquired Assets or the Business are or may
be subject to taxation in a jurisdiction in which Tax Returns are not filed
with respect thereto.

(e) No payment or benefit which will or may be made by Seller or its ERISA
Affiliates with respect to any Business Employee or any other "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder)
will be characterized as a "parachute payment," within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code.

(f) _Section 5.7(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and accurate list of each Contract or plan of a Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries with a Business Employee that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A(d)(1)) and
each such Contract or plan is, or has been, in documentary and operational
compliance with Code Section 409A and the applicable guidance issued
thereunder.

 

5.8 _Personal Property_. Except for Excluded Assets listed on _Schedule 2.2_ ,
_Section 5.8_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and

computers) owned by a Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and used in, or held
for use in, the operation of the Business, as of the date of this Agreement,
and (iii) all other material Tangible Property owned by a Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and used in, or held for use in, the operation of the Business,
as of the date of this Agreement. To Sellers Knowledge, the foregoing
personal properties and assets are in good operating condition and repair and
free from any material defects, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

 

5.9 _Real Property_.

(a) No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, or has ever owned any Real
Property or is a party to any agreement to purchase or sell any Real Property,
in the case of Parent, used in the operation of the Business.

(b) _Section 5.9(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the names
of the lessor, lessee, the address of any parcel of Real Property leased,
subleased or licensed by any Seller or its Subsidiaries as lessor or lessee or
otherwise used or occupied by the Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries, in the
case of Parent, used in the operation of the Business (the " _Leased Real
Property_ "). Each Seller has made available to Buyer a true and correct copy
of each lease, sublease, amendment, extension, renewal, guaranty, license,
concession or other agreement (collectively, the " _Leases_ ") with respect
to each such Leased Real Property, and in the case of any oral Lease, a
written summary of the material terms of such Lease. With respect to each of
the Leases, (i) the Leases constitute all written and oral agreements of any
kind for the leasing, rental, use or occupancy of the Leased Real Property to
which a Seller is a party or otherwise bound, (ii) a Seller or its Subsidiary,
as applicable, holds a good and valid leasehold interest in the Leased Real
Property free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and (iii) no
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has assigned, transferred, sublet, or
granted any person the right to use or occupy the Leased Real Property or
granted any other security interest in such Lease or any interest therein.

(c) Each Lease is a valid and binding agreement of a Seller or its
Subsidiaries and is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. To
Sellers Knowledge, no Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated or
breached in any material respect, and no Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries has committed any material default under, any Lease, which
remains uncured, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no other Person has
violated or breached in any material respect, or committed any material
default under, any Lease which remains uncured. To the Knowledge of the
Sellers, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that
(with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be
expected to: (i) result in a material violation or material breach of any of
the provisions of any Lease, (ii) give any Person the right to declare a
default, (iii) give any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or
performance of any Lease, or (iv) give any Person the right to
cancel, terminate or modify any Lease. No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice regarding any actual or possible material
violation or material breach of, or material default under, any Lease, which
remains uncured. No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any of its
respective material rights under Lease. If the applicable lessor consents are
obtained, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Sellers does
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair
the rights of any of the Sellers or its Subsidiaries or alter the rights or
obligations of the sublessor, lessor or licensor under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Leases,
or otherwise adversely affect the continued use and possession of the
Leased Real Property for the conduct of business as presently conducted.

(d) The Leased Real Property is in good operating condition and repair and is
suitable for the operation of the Business as presently conducted therein.
Neither the operation of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on the Leased
Real Property nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, such Leased Real
Property, violate any Law relating to such property or operations thereon. No
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries could be required to expend more than
$10,000 in causing any Leased Real Property to comply with the surrender
conditions set 

 



-34-   forth in the applicable Lease. No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is
party to any agreement or subject to any claim that may require the payment of
any real estate brokerage commissions, and no such commission is owed with
respect to any of the Leased Real Property. A Seller or its Subsidiary
currently occupies all of the Leased Real Property for the operation of the
Business, and there are no other parties or employees occupying, or with a
right to occupy, the Leased Real Property. The Sellers and each of its
Subsidiaries has performed all of its obligations under any termination
agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any leases of Real Property
that are no longer in effect and has no continuing liability with respect to
such terminated Real Property leases.

5.10 _Environmental Matters_.

(a) Each Seller and its Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance in all
material respects with all Environmental Laws that are applicable to the
Business, any of the Acquired Assets or any Leased Real Property. No event has
occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, that will (with or without
notice or lapse of time) constitute or result in a violation by a Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries of, or a failure on the part of a Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to comply with, any Environmental Law that is applicable to the
Business, any of the Acquired Assets or any Leased Real Property.

(b) Except in compliance with Environmental Laws and in a manner that would
not subject a Seller or any Subsidiary to Liability, no Hazardous Materials
are present on any Business Facility currently owned, operated, occupied,
controlled or leased by a Seller or any Subsidiary or were present on any
other Business Facility at the time it ceased to be owned, operated,
occupied, controlled or leased by a Seller or any of its Subsidiary.

(c) _Section 5.10(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule accurately describes
all of the Environmental Permits currently held by any Seller and its
Subsidiaries and the listed Environmental Permits are all of the Environmental
Permits necessary for the continued conduct of the Business as currently
conducted. All such Environmental Permits are valid and in full force and
effect. Each Seller and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all covenants and conditions of all such Environmental Permits.
To Sellers Knowledge, no circumstances exist which could cause any
Environmental Permit to be revoked, modified, or rendered non-renewable upon
payment of the permit fee.

(d) No Action is pending, or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened
against any Seller, any Subsidiary or any Leased Real Property, that relates
to any Environmental Law, Environmental Permit or Hazardous Materials in
connection with the Sellers conduct of the Business.

(e) There is no fact, circumstance, condition or activity which could result
in any environmental Liability which could reasonably be expected to result in
a Business Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Leases, neither
any Seller nor any Subsidiary has entered into any agreement that may require
it to guarantee, reimburse, pledge, defend, hold harmless or indemnify any
other party with respect to Liabilities arising out of Environmental Laws or
the Hazardous Materials related activities of a Seller or any Subsidiary in
connection with the conduct of the Business.

(f) The Sellers have made available to Buyer true and complete copies of all
environmental assessments and audits in the possession or control of the
Sellers and its Subsidiaries, and any correspondence and documentation
relating to compliance or non-compliance with Environmental Laws in the
possession or control of the Seller or its Subsidiaries in each case in
connection with the conduct of the Business.

is currently in compliance with formal legal requirements (including payment

representation or warranties, granted any indemnities, or made any other
commitments with respect to the Transferred IPR or Products other than those
set forth in such Sellers or its Subsidiaries form agreements, which forms
have been provided to Buyer. Each Seller has all rights necessary to transfer
the Transferred Technology, including data, without violating any Laws
(including any Laws relating to privacy or use of customer data) or
contractual obligations of such Seller, and upon the Closing, Buyer shall have

which it was used in the Business prior to the Closing without violating
any Laws (including any Laws relating to privacy or use of User Data) or
contractual obligations of such Seller.

(d) _No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights_. The operation of the Business
by any Seller or its Subsidiaries, and the Acquired Assets (i) have not
infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated or constituted the
unauthorized use of, and as currently conducted do not, nor do the
Transferred Technology (in the form and manner in which it exists and is used
in the Business at Closing) infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate or
constitute the unauthorized use of, any Intellectual Property Rights owned by

and (ii) have not constituted and do not constitute unfair competition or
trade practices under applicable Laws. No Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received written notice from any Person (i) claiming the operation of the
Business, or any Acquired Assets infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise

otherwise conveyed or provided to a Seller (such Contracts, " _In-Licenses_
").

 



-36-    _Section 5.11(f)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all
Contracts pursuant to which a Seller has granted a third party any rights or

the Sellers shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly,
or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be
done promptly, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) cause the conditions precedent set forth in 
_Section 3.4_ to be satisfied as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (b) obtain all necessary or appropriate consents, waivers, and
approvals under any Transferred Contracts in connection with this Agreement

the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, (c) obtain all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities, the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting periods, making all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings

additional certificates and other instruments that are necessary to consummate
the Transactions and to fully carry out the purpose and intent of this

right) upon, or otherwise requires in response to a notice or consent request
regarding this Agreement, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing"
payment or other consideration (including increased rent payments), or the
provision of additional security (including a guaranty), the Sellers shall be
solely responsible for making all such payments or providing all such
additional security.

 

8.2 _Regulatory Filings_.

(a) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
8.1_, as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, each of Buyer and the Sellers shall file with the FTC and
the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to
this

 



-49-   Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Transactions) and thereby as required by
the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and the Sellers shall promptly (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other
with any information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings,
(iii) supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or

of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transactions) or
any of the other Transaction Agreements. If any Party or Affiliate thereof
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Transactions) or any of the other
Transaction Agreements, then such party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
8.1_, promptly after execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing,
each Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts, at such Sellers
expense, to transfer to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (effective as of the
Closing) all Permits held by such Seller and relating to the Business and the
Acquired Assets on the date of this Agreement, and Buyer will cooperate with
the Sellers in assisting with such transfers or applications. Prior to the
Closing, the Sellers shall have initiated the transfer or application process,
as applicable, in respect of each such Permit subject to Buyers having
cooperated with such efforts. For a period of one (1) year after the Closing,
subject to Buyers cooperation with such efforts, the Sellers shall, at the
Sellers expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the
transfer or application process for all such Permits that were not transferred
to or obtained for Buyer and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing as quickly
as commercially practicable.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed that (i) neither Buyer nor the Sellers shall
have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, and (ii) neither Buyer nor the
Sellers shall be under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out
agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for (A)
the sale, divestiture, license, or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their business or
own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the Business or any of the
Acquired Assets or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the Business and
the Acquired Assets.

8.3 _Access to Information_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement and prior to the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any information that is withheld pursuant to applicable Law
to be provided or made available in a manner that is not prohibited by
applicable Law), each Seller shall afford Buyer and its accountants, counsel,
and other representatives, reasonable access (subject to advance notice and
Buyers non-interference with the Business) during such Sellers normal
business hours to (a) all of the assets, properties, Books and Records,
Contracts, Permits, commitments, documents, and personnel of such Seller and
its Subsidiaries that are related to the Business (but only to the extent
applicable to the Business), and (b) all other information concerning the
business, properties, and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by
applicable Law) of such Seller and its Subsidiaries that are related to the
Business as Buyer may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained
by Buyer in any investigation conducted pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_
shall be deemed to affect or modify, amend, or supplement any representation
or warranty set forth herein or the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
Transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, or the
remedies available to the Parties hereunder.

 



-50-  8.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or
warranty of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect at or prior to the Closing, (ii) any failure of Seller
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder in any material respect, and (iii)
the occurrence or failure of any event, that, individually or in the
aggregate, results in or is reasonably likely to result in, a Business
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Buyer shall promptly notify Parent of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event that would cause any representation or warranty of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at
or prior to the Closing, (ii) any failure of Buyer to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder in any material respect, and (iii) the occurrence or failure of any
event, that, individually or in the aggregate, results in or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ shall not be
deemed to affect or modify, amend, or supplement any representation or
warranty set forth herein or the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or the conditions
to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transactions in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof, or the remedies available to the
Parties hereunder.

8.5 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the existence of this
Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and the other
Transaction Agreements, and the terms and conditions hereof and thereof, shall
constitute "Confidential Information" under and within the meaning of the
Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of June 20, 2013, by and
between Buyer and PES (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") except with
respect to and subject to Buyers obligation to comply with applicable U.S.
Securities Laws and the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market.

 

(b) After the Closing (and, with respect to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at all times after the Closing), unless required by Law or Order
to disclose any Business Confidential Information or as explicitly permitted
by _Section 8.7_, each Seller agrees not to use or disclose at any time (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates not to use or
disclose at any time) any Business Confidential Information, provided, subject
to _Section 11.1_, that the forgoing shall not limit the Sellers or their
Affiliates or successors or assigns from continuing to use any
Shared Technology or any other Technology that is not solely used in the
Business, in the continuation of their retained businesses. In the event a
Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates are required by Law or Order to
disclose any Business Confidential Information, such Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the
legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and such Seller
and its controlled Affiliates shall cooperate with Buyer to preserve the
confidentiality of such information consistent with such applicable Law or
Order. For all purposes of and under this Agreement and subject to the
remainder of this clause, the term " _Business Confidential Information_ "
shall mean all information to the extent solely related to the Business (i) of
a confidential or proprietary nature (whether or not specifically labeled or
identified as "confidential"), or (ii) which is information that a reasonable
person would, in light of the nature of the information, consider to be
confidential and proprietary to the Business, including the following: (A)
internal business and financial information (including information relating
to strategic and staffing plans and practices, business, finances, training,
marketing, promotional and sales plans and practices, cost, rate and pricing
structures, and accounting and business methods), (B) identities of,
individual requirements of, specific contractual arrangements with, and
information about, the Business and its suppliers, customers, independent
contractors, or other business relations and their confidential information,
(C) trade secrets, proprietary know-how, compilations of data and analyses,
techniques, systems, formulae, recipes, research, records, reports, manuals,
documentation, models, data, and

 



-51-   databases relating thereto, and (D) inventions, innovations, improvements,
developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, and all similar
or related information (whether or not patentable). Nothing in this _Section
8.5(b)_ is intended to prevent a Seller or any Affiliate from exercising any
of its rights under _Article 4_, or fulfilling its obligations under the
Transition Services Agreement,  _provided_ that such Seller protects the
confidentiality of Business Confidential Information as required by this
_Section 8.5(b)_ and complies with _Section 11.1_. Business Confidential
Information does not include information that is or later becomes publicly
known or known in the trade or industry other than as a result of disclosure
in violation of this _Section 8.5_.

8.6 _Exclusivity_. Each Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Affiliates, representatives, officers, employees,
directors, managers, and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
initiate, entertain, encourage, or accept the submission of any proposal or
offer from any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) relating to the
direct or indirect acquisition of the Business or any portion of the Acquired
Assets, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations (and as of the date
of this Agreement, each Seller shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations that are ongoing) regarding, furnish any information with
respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any third party to do or seek any of the foregoing, or
(c) furnish any confidential information regarding the Business or the
Acquired Assets to any third party. Each Seller will notify Buyer promptly,
and in any event within 24 hours, if any third party makes any proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing (including the
terms thereof and the identity of such third party subject to applicable
Law). Each Seller shall be deemed to have breached the terms of this _Section
8.6_ if any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Affiliates,
representatives, officers, employees, directors, managers, or agents takes
any action, whether in his or her capacity as such or in any other capacity,
that is prohibited by this _Section 8.6_.

8.7 _Public Statements_. Except as required by Law, the Sellers shall not,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly make or
issue any statement or other communication to the public or any third party
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Agreements, or the terms and conditions hereof or thereof, including, if
applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, or
any disputes or arbitration proceedings hereunder or thereunder.

8.8 _Record Retention_. Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
controlled Affiliates, that for a period of not less than six (6) years
following the Closing Date, it shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any
of the Books and Records relating to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities in its possession with respect to periods prior to the Closing.
Each Party shall have the right to destroy all or part of such Books and
Records after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date or, at an
earlier time by giving each other Party twenty (20) days prior written
notice of such intended disposition and by offering to deliver to the other
party, at the other Partys expense, custody of such Books and Records as such
first party may intend to destroy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, immediately
after the Closing (or at such later time as required under the terms and
provisions of the Transition Services Agreement), the Sellers shall deliver to
Acquisition Sub or destroy copies of Transferred Technology in the Sellers
possession that are in addition to copies delivered to Acquisition Sub as part
of the Closing, whether such copies are in paper form, on computer media or
stored in another form; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (a) the Sellers and
their Subsidiaries are entitled to possess such copies to the extent expressly
permitted by this Agreement, (b) the Sellers and their Subsidiaries may retain
and use copies of financial books and records relating to the Business, and
(c) Sellers and their Subsidiaries may also retain any copies of Transferred
Technology that reside on back-up, archival or disaster recovery systems where
such copies are co-mingled with other non-transferred property or kept in
such a manner that it is burdensome to locate, separate or extract such copies
without undue expense or effort, until they are destroyed in accordance with
the applicable retention and purge policies, provided such copies are not
used for production purposes.

8.9 _Bulk Sales_. It will not be practicable to comply or to attempt to
comply with the procedures of the Uniform Commercial Code or other bulk sales
laws or similar laws of the jurisdiction in which the Acquired Assets to be
conveyed hereby are situated or of any other jurisdictions which may be
asserted to be applicable to the transaction contemplated hereunder, and the
Parties believe that it is not clear that any such laws are

 



-52-   applicable to such transaction. Accordingly, to induce Buyer to waive any
requirement for compliance on the part of the Sellers with the procedures of
any such laws, the Sellers hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, in accordance with the provisions of _Article 13_,
from and against, and to compensate and reimburse the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, in accordance with the provisions of  _Article 13_, for, any and
all Losses arising out of or resulting from the failure of the Sellers to
comply with or perform any actions in connection with the provisions of any
such law of any states or jurisdictions applicable to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

8.10 _Business Relationships; Payments_.

 

(a) Until the Closing (and except as otherwise provided in the Transition
Services Agreement), each Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in Buyers
efforts to continue and maintain for the benefit of Buyer those business
relationships of the Business existing prior to the Closing, including
relationships with customers, suppliers and others.

 

(b) After the Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
as promptly as practicable, deliver, and if necessary endorse over to the
other Party, any mail, cash, checks or other instruments of payment such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries receive to which the other Party is entitled to in
accordance with this Agreement and shall hold such cash, checks or
other instruments of payment in trust for the other Party until such
delivery.

8.11 _Board Matters_. Promptly following the Closing, Buyer shall recommend
to its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the " _Nominating
Committee_ ") that the Person listed on _Schedule 8.11_ (the " _Nominee_ ")
be invited to join Buyers board of directors (the " _Buyer Board_ "). If the
Nominating Committee recommends to the Buyer Board that the Nominee be
appointed to the Buyer Board, the Buyer Board shall consider such
recommendation. If the Nominee shall be invited to join the Buyer Board, and
upon the Nominees acceptance of such invitation, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Buyer Board to, take all necessary actions to appoint the Nominee as a
member of the Buyer Board.

 

8.12 _Sale of Shares_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable to the Sellers in the Transactions shall
constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 of the
Securities Act and will be issued in a private placement transaction in
reliance upon the exemption from the registration and prospectus delivery
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The certificates
evidencing the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Transactions
shall bear appropriate legends to identify such privately placed shares as
being "restricted securities" under the Securities Act to comply with state
and federal securities laws and, if applicable, to notice the restrictions on
transfer of such shares.

8.13 _Exclusive Commercial Relationship_.

 

(a) Each Seller shall take the actions and have the obligations as set forth
on _Schedule 8.13_. In the event that the Sellers or their Affiliates do not
satisfy the requirements contemplated by _Schedule 8.13(f)_ , then the Sellers
shall as promptly as practicable after the end of the time period contemplated
in _Schedule 8.13(f)_ , and in any event within thirty (30) days after the
end of such period, deliver and/or pay to Buyer Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000) (the " _Commercial Fee Amount_ ") by (i) delivery of shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the Commercial Fee Amount  _divided_ by the
Escrow Price (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), and (ii) to the extent that
the Parent Holders do not own Buyer Common Stock sufficient to satisfy the
entire Commercial Fee Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such extent to an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyer.

(b) In the event that Buyer shall receive the Commercial Fee Amount, the
receipt of such Commercial Fee Amount shall be deemed to be liquidated damages
for all Losses incurred by Buyer in connection with (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of the representations or warranties set forth in _Section 5.1(d)
_

 



-53-   (solely as _Section 5.1(d)_ relates to this _Section 8.13_ and the
corresponding actions and obligations on _Schedule 8.13_ ) and _Section
5.3(b)_, and (ii) any breach of this _Section 8.13_ (and the corresponding
actions and obligations on _Schedule 8.13_ only) (collectively, the "
_Excluded 8.13 Items_ ") and, except for claims arising out of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, Buyer shall not be entitled to bring or
maintain any Action or Indemnification Claim arising under the Excluded 8.13
Items.

(c) In the event that the Sellers or their Affiliates do satisfy the
requirements contemplated by _Schedule 8.13(f)_ , then from the time the
requirements contemplated by _Schedule 8.13(f)_ are satisfied Buyer and the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under _Article
13_ with respect to any non-fulfillment or breach by Sellers of this _Section
8.13_ (and the corresponding actions and obligations on _Schedule 8.13_ ),
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to bring or maintain any Action or Indemnification Claim in respect
of any breach or inaccuracy of the representations or warranties set forth in
_Section 5.1(d)_ (solely as _Section 5.1(d) _relates to this _Section 8.13_
and the corresponding actions on _Schedule 8.13_ only) and _Section 5.3(b)_.

 

8.14 _Membership Interest Transfer Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms, including representations,
warranties, covenants, indemnities, and closing conditions, of an agreement
providing for the transfer (for no additional consideration) of all of the
membership interests in PEF to Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer (as directed by
Buyer) on commercially reasonable terms mutually acceptable to Buyer and the
Sellers (the " _MITA_ "), which MITA, if executed, shall be deemed a
Transaction Agreement. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
the MITA shall be referred to herein as the " _MITA Closing_ ".

ARTICLE 9

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

9.1 _Offered Employees_. Prior to the Closing, the Chief Executive Officer of
each of Parent and of Buyer shall mutually agree on a minimum list of Business
Employees other than any Leave Employees to be offered employment with Buyer
by Buyer (the " _Offered Employees_ "). The Sellers shall provide all
reasonable assistance to Buyer and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
offers of employment to the Offered Employees contemplated by the preceding
sentence. Those Offered Employees who accept employment from Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to the offers of employment made pursuant to this

termination, severance or similar liabilities) arising from or associated
with or in connection with any Offered Employee who declines to accept such
offer of employment.

9.3 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
all provisions set forth in this _Article 9_ or any other provision of this
Agreement with respect to Business Employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective Parties and shall not create any right (a) in any other
Person, including any Business Employees, former Business Employees, any
participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, (b) to
continued employment, either before or after the Closing, with any of the
Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (c) to be construed
to modify, amend or establish any benefit plan, program or arrangement or in
any way affect the ability of the Parties or any other Person to modify,
amend or terminate any of its benefit plans, programs or arrangements

prior to the Closing Date, whether required to be filed prior to, on or after
the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
applicable law and consistent with the Sellers past practices. During a
reasonable period prior to filing, the Sellers shall permit Buyer to review
and comment on each such Tax Return to the extent that Buyer could be
liable for the Taxes reflected thereon as a successor or otherwise by
operation of law, and shall consider in good faith Buyers reasonable
comments. Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file
or cause to be timely filed, all other Tax Returns of or with respect to the
Acquired Assets or the Business. To the extent that the Party responsible
pursuant to this Agreement for filing a Tax Return (the " _Filing Party_ ") is
required to remit any Taxes that the other Party is responsible pursuant to
this Agreement to pay (the " _Paying Party_ "), the filing Party shall provide
a copy of the proposed Tax Return to the Paying Party prior to filing, and the
Paying Party shall pay to the Filing Party any such Taxes within ten (10)
days after receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of the amount of such
Taxes.

 

10.2 _Responsibility for Pre-Closing Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall be solely responsible for and
shall timely pay any and all Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities. In the case
of any taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date
(each, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the real, personal and intangible property
Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") with respect to the Acquired Assets or the
Business that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to
the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

 

10.3 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Transaction will be fully taxable for income tax purposes. At least twenty
(20) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and the Sellers will agree in
writing with respect to the preliminary allocation of the Purchase Price to be
paid pursuant to _Article 3_ among the Sellers and their Subsidiaries based
on the fair market value of the Acquired Assets to be transferred by each of
them. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
the Sellers an allocation of the Purchase Price to be paid pursuant to the
terms of _Article 3_ (including any Assumed Liabilities (and, if the MITA
Closing occurs, the liabilities of PEF) to the extent properly taken into
account for income tax purposes) among the Acquired Assets (and, if the MITA
Closing occurs, the assets of PEF) and the covenants set forth in _Article
10_ in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (the " _Allocation_ "). Buyer
and the Sellers will cooperate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days
thereafter to reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation. Any disputes
regarding the Allocation shall be resolved by a nationally recognized
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Sellers, the costs of
which shall be borne equally by Buyer on one hand and the Sellers on the
other. The Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustments to the
Purchase Price. The Allocation as agreed to by the Parties or as finally
determined by such accounting firm shall be referred to as the " _Final
Allocation_." Buyer and the Sellers agree to report and to cause each of their
respective Affiliates to report the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation for all Tax
purposes, and none of them will take any position or cause their respective
Affiliates to take any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, in
any litigation, or otherwise, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
Buyer and the Sellers shall promptly notify the other parties in writing upon
receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit or assessment
challenging the Final Allocation.

 

10.4 _Cooperation; Tax Contests_. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Returns of or with respect to the Acquired Assets or the
Business, and in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes relating or attributable thereto for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (each, a " _Tax Contest_ "). Such

 



-55-   cooperation shall include retention and provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest and making
employees available on a reasonable and mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.
Any Tax Contest shall be considered a Third Party Claim governed by _Section
13.5_.

 

10.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, value-added, goods and
services, recording, ad valorem, privilege, documentary, gains, gross
receipts, registration, conveyance, excise, license, stamp, duties or similar
Taxes and fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Sellers. The Sellers
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed any Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with such
Transfer Taxes at their own expense.

 

ARTICLE 11

NON-COMPETITION; NON-SOLICITATION

11.1 _Non-Competition_. 

(a) Each of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that Buyer would be
irreparably damaged if a Seller were to provide services to or otherwise
participate in a Competing Business and that any such competition by a Seller
(or its Affiliates) would result in a significant loss of goodwill by Buyer.
Each of the Sellers further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
agreements set forth in this _Article 11_ were a material inducement to Buyer
to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and
that Buyer would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this
Agreement as specifically negotiated by the Parties if a Seller breached the
provisions of this _Section 11.1_. Therefore, each of the Sellers agrees, in
further consideration of the amounts to be paid hereunder for the
Acquired Assets and the goodwill of the Sellers sold by the Sellers that at
all times until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in,
conduct, manage, operate, own, control, participate in the management
of (whether as an officer, director, employee, partner, agent representative
or otherwise) or consult with a Competing Business in the Competing Territory
or any portion thereof, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not preclude the
ownership by the Sellers and their Affiliates of less than two percent (2%)
of the outstanding securities of any publically traded company, _provided,
further_ , __ that the restrictions in this _Section 11.1(a)_ shall not
prohibit or restrict the Sellers performance, satisfaction or fulfillment of
ongoing service or warranty obligations under any of the Specifically Excluded
Contracts under which Seller has ongoing service or warranty obligations. Each
of the Sellers acknowledges that the Business has been conducted or is
presently proposed to be conducted throughout the Competing Territory and that
the geographic restrictions set forth above are reasonable and necessary to
protect the goodwill of the Business being sold by the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement.

(b) Buyer agrees that at all times until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly
or indirectly, share or otherwise provide any third party who is in the
consumer lending and financing business with access to the Customer DB.

 

11.2 _Non-Solicitation_.

(a) So long as the employment of the Key Employees by Buyer and its Affiliates
has not been terminated, each of the Sellers agrees that, until the fifth
(5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, it shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to)
directly, or indirectly through another Person, (a) induce or attempt to
induce to leave employment, or hire any Transferred Employee, or (b) hire
any person who was an employee of the Business at any time during the six (6)
month period immediately prior to the date on which such hiring would take
place (it being conclusively presumed by the parties so as to avoid any
disputes under this  _Section 11.2_ that any such hiring within such six-
month period is in violation of clause (a) above); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that non-directed newspaper or internet help wanted advertisements and search
firm engagements shall not be considered solicitations hereunder.

 



-56-  (b) If the employment of the Key Employees by Buyer and its Affiliates has
been terminated, each of the Parties agrees that, until the second (2nd)
anniversary of such termination, without the prior written consent of Parent,
in the case of the Sellers, or Buyer, in the case of Buyer or Acquisition Sub,
it shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to)
directly, or indirectly through another Person, induce or attempt to induce to
leave employment, or hire any Employee of any of the applicable Parties;
provided, however, that non-directed newspaper or internet help wanted
advertisements and search firm engagements shall not be considered
solicitations hereunder.

(c) For so long as each of the Sellers has continuing obligations under
_Section 11.1_, call on, solicit or service any customer, supplier, licensee,
licensor or other third party with a business relationship with the Business
(including any Person that was a customer, supplier or other third party with
a potential business relationship with the Business at any time during the
twelve (12) month period immediately prior to such call, solicit or service)
with the intent to induce or attempt to induce such Person to cease doing
business with the Business, or in any way interfere with the business
relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other
third party and the Business (including making any negative statements or
communications about the Business) in a manner harmful to the Business.

11.3 _Severability_. If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants
contained in _Section 8.5_ and this _Article 11_ (the " _Restrictive
Covenants_ "), a court shall hold that the duration, scope or area
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then
existing, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area
reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated
duration, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed and directed to
revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope
and area permitted by Law. The Sellers have consulted with legal counsel
regarding the Restrictive Covenants and based on such consultation have
determined and hereby acknowledge that the Restrictive Covenants are
reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions and are necessary
to protect the goodwill of the Business and the substantial investment in the
Sellers made by Buyer hereunder. The Sellers further acknowledge and agree
that the Restrictive Covenants are being entered into by it in connection with
the sale by the Sellers of the Acquired Assets and the goodwill of the
Business pursuant to this Agreement and not directly or indirectly in
connection with Sellers employment or other relationship with Buyer.

or representatives in connection herewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such termination shall relieve any Party from liability resulting from or
arising out of any willful and intentional breach of such Partys
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth herein or
impair the right of any Party to compel specific performance by the other
Party of its obligations under this Agreement; and _provided further_ that
the provisions of _Section 8.5_ (Confidentiality), _Section 8.7_ (Public
Statements), this _Section 12.2_ and _Article 15_ shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement under the terms of
_Section 12.1_.

ARTICLE 13

 

POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

13.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. If the Transactions are
consummated, (a) the representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth

Persons who control or are controlled by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, and
their respective agents and other representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses which are directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or to
which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may otherwise directly or

any third party claim) and which arise directly or indirectly from or as a
result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties

Sellers under the Transition Services Agreement and any Action relating
thereto (including any Action commenced by any Buyer Indemnified Party for
the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this _Article 13_).

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article 13_, from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,

Action commenced by any Seller Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcing
any of its rights under this _Article 13_).

(c) Except in the event of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, from and

indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement shall be
the exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to any breach of,
inaccuracy in or nonfulfillment of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements

inaccuracy in or failure of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement given or made by the Sellers that is qualified or limited in scope

such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be deemed to be
made or given without such qualification or limitation.

the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or by the waiver of any
condition. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement based on any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be required to show
reliance on any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in order
for such Buyer Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement hereunder. Buyer and the Sellers each
acknowledge that such Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved
contingencies existing at the Closing, which if resolved at the Closing would
have led to a reduction in the Purchase Price that Buyer would have paid in
connection with the Transactions.

 

13.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Except for claims arising out of fraud
or intentional misrepresentation:

 

(a) A (i) Seller Indemnified Party shall not be entitled recover any Losses
under _Section 13.2(b)(i)_ in respect of any breach or inaccuracy of any of
the representations and warranties made by Buyer in the Transaction Agreements
(other than any Buyer Fundamental Representation) and (ii) Buyer Indemnified
Party shall not be entitled to recover any Losses under  _Section
13.2(a)(i)_ in respect of any breach or inaccuracy of any representations or
warranties made by the Sellers in the Transaction Agreements (other than any
Seller Fundamental Representation), in each case unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Losses is at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000) (the " _Basket_ "), after which the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover the amount of all of such Losses from the
first dollar of such Losses without regard to the Basket.

(b) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover:

(i) under _Section 13.2(a)(i)_: (i) in respect of any breach of

-60-   in any Transaction Agreement shall be limited to the amount then available
in the Escrow Fund, and (ii) in respect of any breach of or inaccuracy in any
Seller Fundamental Representation shall be limited to One Hundred Twenty
Million Dollars ($120,000,000);

13.2(a)(ii)_ through _13.2(a)(vi)_ shall be unlimited; and

(iii) under  _Section 13.2(a)(vii)_ shall be limited to the amount then
available in the Escrow Fund _plus_ the aggregate amounts actually paid by
Buyer or Acquisition Sub under the Transition Services Agreement (provided,
that notwithstanding anything in the Transition Services Agreement to the
contrary, any amounts accrued but unpaid by Buyer owed to the Sellers will be
forfeited by the Sellers to the extent necessary to satisfy such recovery).

 

(c) The maximum aggregate amount of Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover:

 

(i) under _Section 13.2(b)(i)_: (i) in respect of any breach of or inaccuracy

Fundamental Representation) set forth in this Agreement shall be limited to
Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000) as reduced by any Losses recovered by the
Seller Indemnified Parties, and (ii) in respect of any breach of or
inaccuracy in any Buyer Fundamental Representation shall be limited to One
Hundred Sixteen Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($116,300,000); and

(ii) for fraud, intentional misrepresentation or under _Sections 13.2(b)(ii)_
through _13.2(b)(iii)_ shall be unlimited.

 

(d) So long as the amount available in the Escrow Fund (calculated for all
purpose as if the value of a share of the Buyer Common Stock were equal to
(i) the Closing Date Price, if there is no Additional Stock Consideration, or
(ii) the Effective Date Price, if there is Additional Stock Consideration)
exceeds the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement that have been asserted but not resolved, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall seek to recover amounts in respect of any claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under _Section 13.2(a)_
from the Escrow Fund prior to seeking to recover amounts in respect of such
claims directly from the Sellers or Parent Holders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that to the extent any amounts are released from the Escrow Fund to any Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to claims for indemnification that are not
subject to the limitation set forth in _Section 13.3(a)_, such recovered
amounts shall not reduce the amount that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may
recover with respect to claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement that are subject to the limitation contained in _Section
13.3(a)_.

(e) In determining the amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this _Article 13_, the gross amount of the
indemnification will be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party (excluding any costs incurred by an
Indemnified Party in recovering or seeking to recover any insurance proceeds),
and (ii) all amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under
contractual indemnities from third Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that
unless required by applicable Law, no Indemnified Party shall have any
obligation to seek recover under any insurance policy or from any third party
Persons.

13.4 _Indemnification Claims_.

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party believes that it has or may have a right to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement (an "
_Indemnification Claim_ "), such Buyer Indemnified Party shall so notify the
Representative and the Escrow Agent in a written notice (a " _Claim
Certificate_ "), prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period (if
applicable): (i) stating that such Buyer Indemnified Party has directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred any Losses, or reasonably anticipates that it
will directly or

 



-61-   indirectly suffer or incur any Losses, for which it is entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement, (ii) a
brief description in reasonable detail (to the extent available to such Buyer
Indemnified Party) of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each
item of Losses based on such Buyer Indemnified Partys good faith belief
thereof, and (iii) the basis for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under this Agreement to which such item of Losses is related.

(b) In the event that the Representative shall seek to contest any individual
items of Losses set forth in a Claim Certificate, the Representative shall so
notify the Buyer Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such Claim Certificate, which notice shall set forth a brief
description in reasonable detail of the Representatives basis for objecting
to each item of Loss. In the event that the Representative shall fail to
object to any items of Loss set forth in a Claim Certificate within the first
twenty-five (25) days of the foregoing thirty-day period, the Buyer
Indemnified Party may re-send the Claim Certificate (indicating that it is the
second and final notice). In the event that the Representative shall fail to
object to any items of Loss set forth in a Claim Certificate within the thirty
(30) day period following the original receipt of the Claim Certificate, the
Seller Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have irrevocably agreed
and consented to the indemnification, compensation and reimbursement of the
Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such items of Loss pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

(c) If a Seller Indemnified Party believes that it has or may have a right to
a Indemnification Claim, such Seller Indemnified Party shall so notify the
Buyer in a Claim Certificate, prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period (if applicable): (i) stating that such Seller Indemnified
Party has directly or indirectly suffered or incurred any Losses, or
reasonably anticipates that it will directly or indirectly suffer or incur
any Losses, for which it is entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under this Agreement, (ii) a brief description in reasonable
detail (to the extent available to such Seller Indemnified Party) of the
facts, circumstances or events giving rise to each item of Losses based on
such Seller Indemnified Partys good faith belief thereof, and (iii) the basis
for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under this Agreement to
which such item of Losses is related.

13.5 _Third Party Claims_ . In the event any Action is instituted against an
Indemnified Party which involves or appears reasonably likely to involve an
Indemnification Claim hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall, promptly after receipt of notice of any such Action, notify the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any
such Action will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability in connection
therewith only if and to the extent that such failure shall have caused the
damages for which the Indemnified Party is obligated to be greater than such
damages would have been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party
prompt notice hereunder. Upon receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to control the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim by appointing a recognized and reputable
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to be the lead counsel
in connection with such defense; _provided_ , that prior to the Indemnifying
Party assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to the
Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be responsible
for all liabilities and obligations relating to such Third Party Claim up to
the limitations set forth in _Section 13.3_ and subject to such limitations,
and _provided_ , _further_ , that:

 

(a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnified Party (other than any fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying
Party effectively assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding the
foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and except that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay all of the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel if the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party);

 



-62-  (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such
defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party if (i) the claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to
the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to or injure the Indemnified
Partys reputation, business, operations or future business prospects; (iii)
the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party; (iv) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a
substantial likelihood exists of a material conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; (v) upon petition by the
Indemnified Party the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; (vi) the
amount of Losses reasonably estimated to be incurred pursuant to such Third
Party Claim (when combined with all other outstanding claims for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement and any amount previously paid
by the Indemnifying Party that applies toward the applicable cap under
_Section 13.3_ (if any) would exceed the applicable cap contemplated by
_Section 13.3_ (if any)) or (vii) the claim relates to a breach or alleged
breach of _Section 5.4_ (Title; Sufficiency) or _Section 5.11_ (Intellectual
Property);

(c) if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or
ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement
or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the
Indemnified Party or if such settlement does not expressly
and unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all Liabilities with
respect to such claim with prejudice; and

(d) if the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle, adjust or
compromise such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnified Party settles, adjusts or compromises any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such settlement,
adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of the amount of
Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party
Claim (it being understood that if the Indemnified Party requests that the
Indemnifying Party consent to a settlement, adjustment or compromise, the
Indemnifying Party shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent). 

(e) For the purposes of this _Section 13.5_, if the Indemnifying Party is a
Seller or Parent Holder, notice shall instead be given to the Representative
and the Representative shall take all actions of the Indemnifying Party.

13.6  _Representative_.

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Transactions and this Agreement by the
Parent Holders and pursuant to the Parent Holder Agreements, each of the
Parent Holders and the Sellers (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnifying
Parties_ ") shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Parent as his, her or
its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Representative for and on behalf of
the Seller Indemnifying Parties to take all actions under this Agreement that
are to be taken by the Representative, including to amend this Agreement, to
waive any provision of this Agreement, to negotiate payments due pursuant to
this _Article 13_, to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize payment to any Buyer Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by any Buyer Indemnified Party, to object to such
payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders
of courts with respect to, any other claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party
against any Seller Indemnifying Party or by any such Seller Indemnifying Party
against any Buyer Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Buyer
Indemnified Party and any such Seller Indemnifying Party, in each case
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the 

 



-63-   Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein,
the powers conferred above shall not authorize or empower the Representative
to do or cause to be done any of the foregoing (i) in a manner that improperly
discriminates between or among the Seller Indemnifying Parties or (ii) as to
any matter insofar as such matter relates solely and exclusively to a single
Seller Indemnifying Party, whereupon the Representative may appoint the Seller
Indemnifying Party who is alleged to be in breach to handle all matters
related to such indemnification claim on behalf of the Representative, and all
references to the Representative in such event shall include also such Seller
Indemnifying Party. Such agency may be changed by the Parent Holders
from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Representative may not be removed
unless Parent Holders holding an Indirect Ownership Interest (as set forth
on  _Exhibit E_) of at least 51% (a " _Majority Interest_ ") agree to such
removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the
position of Representative may be filled by a Majority Interest. In the event
a vacancy in the position of Representative exists for fifteen (15) or more
days, Parent shall have the right to petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint a replacement Representative. No bond shall be
required of the Representative, and the Representative shall not receive any
compensation for his, her or its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Seller
Indemnifying Parties.

 

(b) The Representative represents and warrants to Parent and to the Escrow
Agent that it has the irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter
into and perform its obligations as Representative under this Agreement and to
bind each of the Indemnifying Parties to its terms, (ii) to give and receive
directions and notices hereunder, and (iii) to make all determinations that
may be required or that it deems appropriate under this Agreement.

(c) Until notified in writing by the Representative that he, she it has
resigned, or that he, she or it has been removed by a Majority Interest,
Parent and the Escrow Agent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions,
instructions and notices of the Representative named above and, thereafter,
upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor named in a
writing executed by a Majority Interest.

(d) The Seller Indemnifying Parties each hereby authorize the Representative
to:

 

(i) Receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the Indemnifying
Parties pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or therewith and to receive
and accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding
arising under this Agreement;

(ii) Engage counsel, and such accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby as the Representative may in its sole
discretion deem appropriate; and

(iii) Take such action as the Representative may in its sole discretion
deem appropriate in respect of: (A) waiving any inaccuracies in the
representations or warranties of Buyer or Acquisition Sub contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered by Buyer or Acquisition Sub pursuant
hereto, (B) taking such other action as the Representative is authorized to
take under this Agreement, (C) receiving all documents or certificates and
making all determinations, in his, her or its capacity as Representative,
required under this Agreement and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to
carry out any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to this _Article 13_ and any waiver of any obligation of
Buyer or Acquisition Sub.

(e) The Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment. The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify the
Representative and hold the Representative harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Representative and arising out of or in

 



-64-   connection with the acceptance or administration of the Representatives
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Representative. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver
of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties; and the
Escrow Agent, Buyer and Acquisition Sub may rely upon any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Seller Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow
Agent, Buyer and Acquisition Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to
any Person for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative.

13.7 _Tax Treatment_. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

ARTICLE 14

REGISTRATION

14.1 _Filing and Effectiveness of Seller Registration Statement_.

(a) Within twenty four (24) hours after the Closing, Buyer shall file a
registration statement on Form S-1 (or other appropriate form) covering the
resale to the public by the Sellers and the Parent Holders if applicable, of
all shares representing the Stock Consideration (the " _Seller Registration
Statement_ ") with the SEC. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Seller Registration Statement to be declared effective by
the SEC as soon as practicable; _provided_ that Buyer shall not be required to
make any filing with the SEC prior to the date that such filing otherwise
would be due. Buyer shall cause the Seller Registration Statement to remain
effective until the one year anniversary of the Effective Date (to be extended
for each day of a Registration Suspension (as defined below)) or such earlier
time as all of the Stock Consideration covered by the Seller Registration
Statement has been sold pursuant thereto or pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act. Buyer shall pay the expenses incurred by it in
complying with its obligations under this _Article 14_, including all
preparation, filing fees, costs and expenses, all exchange listing fees, all
fees, costs and expenses of counsel for Buyer, accountants for Buyer and other
advisors or persons retained by Buyer in connection with the filing of the
Seller Registration Statement, but excluding (i) any brokerage fees, selling
commissions or underwriting discounts incurred by the Sellers and the Parent
Holders in connection with sales under the Seller Registration Statement and
(ii) the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Sellers or the
Parent Holders. For purposes of this _Article 14_ and _Section 3.1(c)_,
"Parent Holders" shall be deemed to include up to twelve (12) additional
Persons specified in the Allocation Letter provided that such Persons execute
and deliver a Selling Stockholder Questionnaire to Buyer prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(b) Buyer may, by written notice to the Representative, (i) delay the filing
or effectiveness of the Seller Registration Statement, or (ii) suspend the
Seller Registration Statement after it has been declared effective by the SEC
and require that the Sellers and the Parent Holders immediately cease sales of
the Stock Consideration and, if applicable, the Additional
Stock Consideration pursuant to the Seller Registration Statement, in each
case only if an event outside of Buyers control occurs that results in the
Seller Registration Statement containing an untrue statement of a material
fact or omitting any fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

(c) If Buyer delays or suspends the Seller Registration Statement or requires
the Sellers and the Parent Holders to cease sales of the Stock Consideration
and, if applicable, the Additional Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section
14.1(b)_, Buyer shall take such actions as may be necessary to file or
reinstate the effectiveness of the Seller Registration Statement and/or give
written notice to the Representative authorizing the Sellers and the Parent
Holders to resume sales pursuant to the Seller Registration Statement. If as a
result thereof the prospectus included in the Seller Registration Statement
has been amended to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Buyer
shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice to the Sellers 

 



-65-   given pursuant to this _Section 14.1(c)_, and the Sellers and the Parent
Holders shall make no offers or sales of the Stock Consideration and, if
applicable, the Additional Stock Consideration pursuant to the Seller
Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not suspend the Seller Registration
Statement pursuant to _Section 14.1(b)_ (a " _Registration Suspension_ ")
for more than thirty (30) days in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that
there is no limit on the number of Registration Suspensions that Buyer can
cause.

 

14.2 _Registration Procedures_.

(a) Buyer shall notify the Representative at any time when the prospectus
included in the Seller Registration Statement contains an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

(b) In connection with the filing by Buyer of the Seller Registration
Statement, Buyer shall make available to the Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers and the Parent Holders, a copy of the prospectus, including a
preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act. 

(c) Buyer shall take any action required to be taken under state securities or
"blue sky" laws in connection with the Seller Registration Statement and the
issuance of the Stock Consideration and, if applicable, Additional Stock
Consideration; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required in
connection with this _Section 14.2(c)_ to qualify as a foreign corporation
or execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

(d) Buyer shall promptly notify the Representative, on behalf of the Sellers
and the Parent Holders, when the Seller Registration Statement has become
effective and anytime when resales must cease or may be resumed.

 

(e) Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
to such Seller Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities
Act, and shall promptly notify Representative accordingly.

(f) If Buyer has delivered a preliminary or final prospectus to the
Representative on behalf of the Sellers and the Parent Holders, and after
having done so the prospectus is amended or supplemented to comply with the
requirements of the Securities Act, Buyer shall promptly notify the
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers and the Parent Holders, and, if
requested by Buyer, the Sellers and the Parent Holders shall immediately cease
making offers or sales of shares representing the Stock Consideration or, if
applicable, the Additional Stock Consideration under the Seller Registration
Statement and return the prospectus to Buyer. Buyer shall promptly provide the
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers and the Parent Holders, with revised
or supplemented prospectus and, following receipt of the revised or
supplemented prospectus, the Sellers and the Parent Holders shall be free to
resume making offers and sales under the Seller Registration Statement. Any
period of time after such request and prior to such receipt shall be deemed a
Registration Suspension.

(g) Buyer shall cause all the Stock Consideration or the Additional Stock
Consideration to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by Buyer are then listed.

 

(h) If necessary, Buyer shall provide a transfer agent, registrar and CUSIP
number for the Stock Consideration, in each case not later than the Effective
Date.

(i) Buyer shall advise the Representative, promptly after it shall receive
notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the
SEC suspending the effectiveness of the Seller Registration Statement.

 



-66-  (j) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and Parent Holder,
each Person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section
15 of the Securities Act, and each brokerage firm that effects a sale of the
Stock Consideration or the Additional Stock Consideration pursuant to the
Seller Registration Statement on behalf of the foregoing Persons (a "
_Selling Brokerage Firm_ "), against all Losses to which any of the foregoing
Persons become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other
federal or state law insofar as such Losses arise out of or are based upon
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Seller Registration Statement or any related prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (and shall reimburse such Persons for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with
investigating or defending any such Losses), except insofar as the same arise
out of or are based upon (i) any information furnished in writing to Buyer by
any Seller or Parent Holder expressly for use therein, (ii) the sale of the
Stock Consideration or the Additional Stock Consideration after the
Representative has been notified in writing or via email of a potential
material misstatement or omission in the Seller Registration Statement or any
related prospectus and prior to Buyers amendment or supplement of the Seller
Registration Statement or such prospectus (or Buyers confirmation there is no
such material misstatement or omission) or (iii) by a Sellers or Parent
Holders failure to deliver a copy of the Seller Registration Statement or
any related prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after Buyer
has made available to the Representative the same prior to any written
confirmation of the sale of the Stock Consideration or the Additional
Stock Consideration.

14.3 _Requirements of Sellers_. Buyer shall not be required to include any
shares representing the Stock Consideration held by a particular Seller or
Parent Holder in the Seller Registration Statement unless such Seller or
Parent Holder owning such Stock Consideration shall have delivered to the
Buyer not later than the Closing Date, in writing such information regarding
such Seller or Parent Holder and the proposed sale of the Stock Consideration
by such Seller or Parent Holder as Buyer may reasonably request and as is
customarily required in connection with the Seller Registration Statement or
as shall be required in connection therewith by the SEC or any state
securities law authorities (the " _Selling Stockholder Questionnaire_ "). A
Seller may not assign any of its rights under this _Article 14_ other than
to the Parent Holders.

this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of
the Parties, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver
is to be effective. No course of dealing and no failure or delay on the part
of any Party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this

partys rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the Parties to this
Agreement to require the performance of a term or obligation under this
Agreement or the waiver by any of the Parties to this Agreement of any breach
hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation
or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach hereunder. No single or
partial exercise of any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy.

 

15.3 _Successors and Assigns_. All covenants and agreements and other
provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of either
Party shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and

in part, to any of its Affiliates, (b) Buyer may assign its rights and

 



-68-   obligations pursuant to this Agreement, in whole or in part, to an entity

assign any or all of its rights pursuant to the Transaction Agreements,
including its rights to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, to any

15.4 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the provisions of
this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each Parties rights
and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, and any such invalidity, illegality and unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction (so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party).

 

15.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in the Transaction Agreements,
each of the Sellers and Buyer shall pay all of its own respective fees, costs
and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment
bankers, brokers and other representatives and consultants) incurred in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions.
Losses suffered by a Party for a breach of this Agreement shall in no way be
limited by the amounts described in this _Section 15.5_.

 

15.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions (without proof of damages) to prevent actual or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity and the Parties hereby agree to waive any
requirements for posting a bond in connection with any such action.

15.7 _Other Remedies_. Except to the extent set forth otherwise herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

15.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically set forth
or referred to herein and except for Selling Brokerage Firms to the extent
set forth in _Section 14.2(j)_, nothing herein expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person any rights
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate,
document, instrument or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be
relied upon other than the Parties hereto and their permitted successors or
assigns. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties
in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
and are not necessarily intended as characterization of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any earlier date.

15.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (and all schedules and exhibits thereto) and all Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement, and all other agreements referred to herein is
complete, and all promises, representations, understandings, warranties and
agreements with reference to the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to
the making of this Agreement relied upon by all the Parties hereto, have been
expressed herein or in such Seller Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits
or such other agreements and this Agreement, including such Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such other agreements supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, to the extent that they related in any way to the subject
matter hereof.

 



-69-  15.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and
the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state without giving
effect to the conflicts of Laws principles thereof.

15.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Without limiting the other provisions of
this  _Section 15.11_, the Parties hereto agree that any legal proceeding by
or against any Party hereto or with respect to or arising out of this
Agreement shall be brought in federal or state courts located in San Mateo
County, California or Santa Clara County, California. By execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each Party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts solely for the purposes
of disputes arising under this Agreement and not as a general submission to
such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter or claim
whatsoever. The Parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of process
out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by
the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such
party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process
shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. The Parties
hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding
under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the foregoing courts
on the basis of (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that it or any of
its property is immune from the above-described legal process, (b) that such
action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for the
action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by such courts, or (c) any other defense that would hinder or delay the
levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any Party hereto is
entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

15.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

15.13  _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the different
Parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by
means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party hereto shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
