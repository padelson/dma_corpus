vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 23, 2013 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Heritage Financial Corporation, a Washington corporation
(" _Heritage_ "), and Washington Banking Company, a Washington corporation ("
_Washington Banking_ ", and together with Heritage, the " _Parties_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Heritage and Washington Banking have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination provided
for herein, pursuant to which Washington Banking will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Heritage (the " _Merger_
"), so that Heritage is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to each party to enter into this Agreement, each of
the directors and executive officers of the Parties has simultaneously
herewith entered into a voting and support agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ in the case of the directors and executive
officers of Heritage and substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ in the case
of the directors and executive officers of Washington Banking (each a "
_Voting and Support Agreement_ ") in connection with the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ "), at
the Effective Time, Washington Banking shall merge with and into Heritage.
Heritage shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Washington. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Washington
Banking shall terminate. 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Washington (the " _Secretary of State_ "), on the Closing Date (the "
_Articles of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of
Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in applicable provisions of the WBCA. 1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Washington Banking, Heritage or the holder
of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of the common stock, no par value per share, of Heritage ("
_Heritage Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue to be one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Subject to _Section 1.4(e)_, each share of the common stock, no par value
per share, of Washington Banking (" _Washington Banking Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
Cancelled Shares (as defined in _Section 1.4(c)_) and Dissenting Shares
(as defined in _Section 1.4(d)_), shall be converted into the right to
receive a fraction of a share of Heritage Common Stock equal to 0.89000 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") and $2.75 in cash (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_
") (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All of the shares of
Washington Banking Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Washington Banking Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ", it
being understood that any reference to "Certificate" shall be deemed, as
appropriate, to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of Washington Banking Common Stock, and it being further
understood that provisions herein relating to Certificates shall be
interpreted in a manner that appropriately accounts for book-entry shares,
including that, in lieu of delivery of a Certificate and a letter of
transmittal as specified herein, shares held in book-entry form may be
transferred by means of an "agents message" to the Exchange Agent or such
other similar evidence of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Washington Banking Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section
1.4(b)_, as well as any cash in lieu of a fractional share interest as
provided in _Section 2.3(f)_ and any dividends as provided in _Section
2.3(c)_.

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Washington Banking Common Stock that
are owned by Washington Banking or Heritage (in each case other than in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted)
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled
shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all shares of
Washington Banking Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not
vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who exercises
dissenters rights when and in the manner required under Chapter 23B.13 of the
WBCA shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such
holder shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted with respect to
the payment of the fair value of such shares under the applicable provisions
of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights provided for pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of the WBCA and this _Section 1.4(d)_ ), unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to demand or receive the fair value of such shares of Washington
Banking Common Stock under the WBCA. If any shareholder dissenting pursuant to
the WBCA and this _Section 1.4(d)_ shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of
Washington Banking Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of
Washington Banking Common Stock, in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)_, without
any interest thereon. Washington Banking shall give Heritage (i) prompt notice
of any written notices to exercise dissenters rights in respect of any
shares of Washington Banking Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
notices and any other instruments served pursuant to the WBCA and received by
Washington Banking relating to shareholders dissenters rights and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for fair value under the WBCA. Washington Banking shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Heritage, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent as defined in _Section 2.1_) 

 



2  pursuant to _Article II_ to pay for shares of Washington Banking Common
Stock for which dissenters rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Heritage upon demand.

kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or similar
event, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio to provide the holders of Washington Banking Common Stock
converted into Merger Consideration the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement with respect to the stock portion of the
Merger Consideration prior to such event, and as so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ , that nothing

Restricted Stock Unit Award and the Option Exchange Ratio, with such
converted restricted stock unit award to continue to be subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to the Washington Banking Restricted
Stock Unit Award under the Washington Banking Stock Plan and the applicable

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Heritage shall appoint an
unrelated bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Washington Banking,

pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and
Heritage shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger
Consideration.

 



4 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within 10 days thereafter), and subject to the receipt by the Exchange
Agent of a list of Washington Bankings shareholders in a format that is
reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of a Certificate, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to each
Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate)) to the Exchange Agent and
shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall
be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering each Certificate in exchange
for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of
Heritage Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after surrender to the Exchange Agent of
its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter
of Transmittal, but not later than five business days after the Effective Time
for any book-entry shares of Washington Banking Common Stock, such holder of
Washington Banking Common Stock will be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of Heritage
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends
or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)_, in respect of the shares of Washington Banking Common Stock
represented by such holders Certificate or Certificates. Until so
surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of Heritage Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article II_.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Heritage Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Heritage Common Stock represented thereby, in each
case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, without interest, and in addition to the other amounts
set forth herein, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
whole shares of Heritage Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not
paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to shares of Heritage Common Stock
represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time
(but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the
issuance of the Heritage Common Stock issuable with respect to such
Certificate.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Washington Banking Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of Washington Banking, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of Heritage Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled, shall be issued or paid in
exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such Washington Banking Common Stock shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined
in _Section 3.10(b)_) required by reason of the payment or issuance to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Heritage that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The
Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) six months after
the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange
Agent Agreement, Heritage) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional
share of Heritage Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Washington Banking Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange
Agent or Heritage, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent or Heritage, as the case may be, and timely
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity (as defined in  _Section
3.4_), such

 



5  withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Washington Banking Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent
or Heritage, as the case may be.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Washington Banking of the shares of Washington Banking
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Washington Banking Common
Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Heritage Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Article II_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of Heritage Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Heritage Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Heritage. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Heritage shall pay to each former
shareholder of Washington Banking who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the Heritage Average Closing Price by (ii) the
fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Washington
Banking Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to
the nearest one ten (thousandth when expressed in decimal form)) of Heritage
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Washington Banking at the expiration of six months after
the Effective Time shall be paid to Heritage. In such event, any former
shareholders of Washington Banking who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Heritage with respect to the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Heritage Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share represented by a Certificate such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Heritage, Washington Banking,
the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Washington Banking Common Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Heritage or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Heritage may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
dividends and distributions to which such person is entitled deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF WASHINGTON BANKING

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Washington
Banking to Heritage concurrently herewith (the " _Washington Banking
Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be
set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Washington Banking
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission by Washington Banking that such item represents a
material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
_Section 3.1_(a)) and

 



6  (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article III_ shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of _Article III_ specifically
referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of _Article III_ to
the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence
of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as disclosed in any
Washington Banking Reports (as defined in _Section 3.12_) filed with the SEC
by Washington Banking since December 31, 2012, and prior to the date hereof
(but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Washington Banking
hereby represents and warrants to Heritage as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_. 

(a) Washington Banking is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Washington, and is a bank
holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the " _BHC Act_ "). Washington Banking has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Washington Banking is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Washington Banking. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Heritage, Washington
Banking or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse
effect on (i) the business, properties, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date
hereof, in United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies
in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market
(including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest
rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, (D)
public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby or actions or
inactions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (E) a decline in the trading price of a
partys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings
projections, but not, in either case, including the underlying causes thereof;
except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the
effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared
to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate), or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party
for financial reporting purposes. True and complete copies of the articles of
incorporation of Washington Banking (the " _Washington Banking Articles_ ")
and the bylaws of Washington Banking (the " _Washington Banking Bylaws_ "),
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by Washington Banking to Heritage.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Washington Banking (a " _Washington Banking Subsidiary_
") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership
or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking and (iii) has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any

 



7  Subsidiary of Washington Banking to pay dividends or distributions except
for statutory restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable
to all entities of the same type and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of Washington Banking that is an insured depository institution
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending
or threatened. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Washington Banking Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries
of Washington Banking as of the date hereof.

shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to
the voting or transfer of the Washington Banking Common Stock or other equity
interests of Washington Banking. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Washington Banking

Restricted Stock Unit Awards set forth above, no equity-based awards
(including any cash awards where the amount of payment is determined in whole
or in part based on the price of any capital stock of Washington Banking
or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding, other than as permitted by
_Section 5.2(b)(iii)_. Washington Banking has not elected to defer interest
payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or related debentures
issued by it or any of its affiliates.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Washington Banking
Disclosure Schedule, Washington Banking owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership
interests of each of the Washington Banking Subsidiaries, free and clear of
any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever
(" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with
respect to Whidbey Island Bank, as provided under applicable law) and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No Washington Banking Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding

 



8  subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 

(c) Washington Banking does not have a dividend reinvestment plan or any
shareholders rights plan.

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking.

and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking. Except for
normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has
initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Washington
Banking, investigation into the business or operations of Washington Banking
or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010, except where such
proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Washington
Banking. There (i) is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to
any examinations or inspections of Washington Banking or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or
disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of Washington Banking or any of
its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010, in each case in clause (i) and (ii),
which would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking.

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries
included (or incorporated by reference) in the Washington Banking Reports
(including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from,
and are in accordance with, the books and records of Washington Banking and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders
equity and consolidated financial position of Washington Banking and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end
audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries have been, and
are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements 

 



10  and reflect only actual transactions. Moss Adams LLP has not resigned (or
informed Washington Banking that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Washington Banking as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Washington Banking on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking, neither
Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected
or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Washington Banking
included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2013 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30,
2013, or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Washington Banking
and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Washington Banking or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking. Washington Banking (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating to Washington
Banking, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Washington Banking by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Washington Bankings outside auditors and the audit
committee of Washington Bankings Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Washington
Bankings ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Washington
Bankings internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to Washington Bankings auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to Heritage. There is
no reason to believe that Washington Bankings outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Washington Banking nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Washington Banking, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Washington Banking or any of
its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Washington Banking or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Washington Banking or
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Washington Banking or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Washington Banking or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Washington Banking
or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of Washington Banking or any committee thereof or to the knowledge
of Washington Banking, to any director or officer of Washington Banking.

 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of Sandler ONeill
and Partners, L.P., neither Washington Banking nor any Washington Banking
Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any
broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers
fees, commissions or 

 



11  finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Washington Banking has disclosed to Heritage
as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the
engagement by Washington Banking of Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. related
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since June 30, 2013, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Washington Banking.

(b) Since June 30, 2013, other than entering into this Agreement or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course.

 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Washington Banking, neither Washington Banking nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to Washington
Bankings knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their current or former directors or executive officers or challenging the
validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory
restriction (other than regulatory restrictions of general application to

Subsidiaries or the assets of Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries
(or that, upon consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, would apply to
the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates).

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Each of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed
(including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other
than extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All
material Taxes of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries (whether or not
shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each
of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or
other third party. Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any
material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of
Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2009
have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or are Tax
Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.
Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material
amount of Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes,
claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax
of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Washington Banking
and its Subsidiaries. Washington Banking has made available to Heritage true
and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements
or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in
the last six years. Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries).
Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member
of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was Washington Banking) or (B) has
any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than

 



12  Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries) under U.S. Department of the
Treasury (" _Treasury_ ") Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries
has been, within the past two years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series
of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of
which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled

a distribution of stock intending to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code. Neither Washington Banking nor any of its
Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning

(a)  _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Washington Banking Disclosure Schedule lists
all material employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")),
whether or not subject to ERISA, and all stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, supplemental retirement, or other benefit plans, programs
or arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, change in
control and severance plans, programs, arrangements or agreements, and other
similar contracts or agreements to or with respect to which Washington Banking
or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of Washington Banking or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together with
Washington Banking would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of
Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or subsections (b), (c), (m) or (o) of Section
414 of the Code (each, a " _Washington Banking ERISA Affiliate_ "), is a party

(c) Each Washington Banking Benefit Plan has been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither
Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, United States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity
with respect to any Washington Banking Benefit Plan, and neither Washington
Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that
would qualify for correction under any such program.

 



13 (d) _Section 3.11(d)_ of the Washington Banking Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Washington Banking Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Washington Banking
Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter, or
an opinion letter for a prototype or volume submitter plan upon which
Washington Banking may rely, with respect to each Washington Banking Qualified
Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of Washington Banking,
there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any Washington Banking Qualified Plan
or the related trust or materially increase the costs relating thereto. No
trust funding any Washington Banking Benefit Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(e) Each Washington Banking Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any
award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code,
has (i) since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material
respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS

ERISA Affiliate has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a
plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "
_Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of Washington Banking and its
Subsidiaries nor any Washington Banking ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a
complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(h)_ of the Washington Banking
Disclosure Schedule, neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries
sponsors, has sponsored or has any obligation with respect to any employee
benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health
or medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code.

(i) All material contributions required to be made to any Washington Banking
Benefit Plan by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Washington Banking Benefit Plan, for any period through
the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Washington Banking. 

(j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Washington Banking,
threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to
Washington Bankings knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may
reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Washington Banking
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Washington Banking Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any
of the Washington Banking Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability of Washington Banking or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a Washington Banking Benefit Plan, or any
other party.

 

(k) None of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries nor any Washington Banking
ERISA Affiliate nor any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in
any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the Washington Banking
Benefit Plans or their related trusts, Washington Banking, any of
its Subsidiaries, any Washington Banking ERISA Affiliate or any person that
Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify,
to any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA.

 



14 (l) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(l)_ of the Washington Banking
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
a right to payment or benefit that has been waived in writing by such
person), or result in any limitation on the right of Washington Banking or any
of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Washington Banking Benefit Plan or related trust.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by Washington
Banking or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or will not be
deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither Washington Banking nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
cause or require Washington Banking or any of its affiliates to establish or
make any contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle. No
Washington Banking Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise. Washington
Banking has made available to Heritage copies of Section 280G calculations
(whether or not final) with respect to any disqualified individual in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(m) There are no pending or, to Washington Bankings knowledge, threatened
material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges
against Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other
material labor disputes against Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither Washington Banking nor any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound
by any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization,
or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee
association applicable to employees of Washington Banking or any of
its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Washington Banking, there are no
organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking to represent any
employees of Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries.

statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier

neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate,

 



15  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Washington
Banking, and to the knowledge of Washington Banking no suspension or
cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or

Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case

operations of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010,
except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Heritage. There (i) is no unresolved violation, criticism, or
exception by any Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement
relating to any examinations or inspections of Heritage or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or
disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency with respect to the
business, operations, policies or procedures of Heritage or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010, in each case in clause (i) and (ii),
which would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Heritage.

 



24 4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of Heritage and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Heritage Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Heritage and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial
position of Heritage and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or
as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Heritage and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Heritage that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Heritage as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Heritage
on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Heritage,
neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Heritage included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2013, or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Heritage and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Heritage or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Heritage. Heritage (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Heritage, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Heritage by others within those entities as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Heritages outside auditors and the
audit committee of Heritages Board of Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Heritages ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Heritages internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Heritages
auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to
Washington Banking. There is no reason to believe that Heritages outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Heritage, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with
respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that

 



25  Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Heritage or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Heritage or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Heritage or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
Heritage or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Heritage, to any
director or officer of Heritage.

4.7  _Broker s Fees_. With the exception of the engagement of D.A. Davidson
and Co., neither Heritage nor any Heritage Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or
finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Heritage has disclosed to Washington Banking
as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the
engagement by Heritage of D.A. Davidson and Co. related to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereunder.

 

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since June 30, 2013, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Heritage.

(b) Since June 30, 2013, other than entering into this Agreement,
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or
the consummation of the acquisition and integration of Valley Community
Bancshares, Inc. and its affiliates, Heritage and its Subsidiaries have
carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course.

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Heritage, neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any, and there are no pending or, to Heritages knowledge, threatened,
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Heritage or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or
executive officers or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory
restriction (other than regulatory restrictions of general application to
banks and bank holding companies) imposed upon Heritage, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries (or that,
upon consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, would apply to Heritage or
any of its affiliates).

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Heritage and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by
it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than
extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material
Taxes of Heritage and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of Heritage and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to
any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third
party. Neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension
or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains
in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of Heritage and its Subsidiaries
for all years to and including 2009 have been examined by the IRS or are Tax
Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under
applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired.
Neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of
Taxes, and there are no threatened in writing or pending disputes, claims,
audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of
Heritage and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Heritage and its Subsidiaries.
Heritage has made available to Washington Banking true and complete copies of
any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition
agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six years.
Neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries is a 

 



26  party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among Heritage and its Subsidiaries). Neither Heritage
nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common
parent of which was Heritage) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
person (other than Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither
Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or
otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intending to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither
Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(1).
At no time during the past five years has Heritage been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code.

 

4.11 _Employees_.

 

(a) _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Heritage Disclosure Schedule lists all material
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not
subject to ERISA, and all stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements,
and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, change in control and
severance plans, programs, arrangements or agreements, and other similar
contracts or agreements to or with respect to which Heritage or any Subsidiary
or any trade or business of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not incorporated, all of which together with Heritage would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or
subsections (b), (c), (m) or (o) of Section 414 of the Code (each, a "
_Heritage ERISA Affiliate_ "), is a party or has any current or future
obligation or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by Heritage or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Heritage ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of
any current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of
Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries or any Heritage ERISA Affiliate (all such
plans, programs, arrangements, contracts or agreements, collectively, the "
_Heritage Benefit Plans_ ").

(b) Heritage has heretofore made available to Washington Banking true and
complete copies of each of the Heritage Benefit Plans and related material
documents, including, but not limited to, (i) all summary plan descriptions,
amendments, modifications or material supplements to the most recent versions
of any Heritage Benefit Plan, (ii) the annual reports (Forms 5500), if any,
filed with the IRS for the last two plan years, (iii) the most recently
received IRS determination or opinion letters, if any, relating to a
Heritage Benefit Plan, and (iv) the most recently prepared actuarial report
for each Heritage Benefit Plan (if applicable) for each of the last two years.

 

(c) Each Heritage Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither Heritage nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a
filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, United
States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
any Heritage Benefit Plan, and neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for correction under
any such program.

 

(d) _Section 4.11(d)_ of the Heritage Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Heritage Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code (the " _Heritage Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter, or an opinion letter for a prototype or volume
submitter plan upon which Heritage may rely, with respect to each Heritage
Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor
has revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of Heritage, there are
no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely
affect the qualified status of any Heritage Qualified Plan or the related
trust or materially increase the costs relating thereto. No trust funding any
Heritage Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.

 



27 (e) Each Heritage Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and any award
thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i)
since January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects,
in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1
and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary
and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

(g) None of Heritage and its Subsidiaries nor any Heritage ERISA Affiliate
has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated
to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer Plan, and none
of Heritage and its Subsidiaries nor any Heritage ERISA Affiliate has incurred
any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of
a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan.

 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 4.11(h)_ of the Heritage Disclosure
Schedule, neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has
sponsored or has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that
provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life
insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code.

(i) All material contributions required to be made to any Heritage Benefit
Plan by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Heritage Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the books and records of Heritage.

 

(j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Heritage, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to Heritages
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit, against the Heritage Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Heritage Benefit Plans or the assets of
any of the trusts under any of the Heritage Benefit Plans which could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Heritage or any
of its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity, any Multiemployer Plan, a
Multiple Employer Plan, any participant in a Heritage Benefit Plan, or any
other party.

 

(k) None of Heritage and its Subsidiaries nor any Heritage ERISA Affiliate nor
any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA),
which could subject any of the Heritage Benefit Plans or their related trusts,
Heritage, any of its Subsidiaries, any Heritage ERISA Affiliate or any person
that Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to
any material tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA.

 

(l) Except as set forth in _Section 4.11(l)_ of the Heritage Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability
or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right
of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Heritage Benefit Plan or related trust. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether
in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by Heritage or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code or will not be deductible under Section 162(m) of
the Code. Neither Heritage nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or
contributes to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or require Heritage or any of
its Affiliates to establish or make any contribution to a rabbi trust or
similar funding vehicle. No Heritage Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

 



28 (m) There are no pending or, to Heritages knowledge, threatened material
labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges against
Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Heritage nor any
of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Heritage, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group seeking
to represent any employees of Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

4.12 _SEC Reports_. Heritage has previously made available to Washington
Banking an accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed
with or furnished to the SEC since December 31, 2010 by Heritage pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the " _Heritage Reports_ ") and (b)
communication mailed by Heritage to its shareholders since December 31, 2010
and prior to the date hereof, and no such Heritage Report, as of the date
thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date. Since December 31, 2010, as of their
respective dates, all Heritage Reports filed under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, no executive officer of Heritage has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect
to any of the Heritage Reports.

 

4.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Heritage and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2010, held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees
and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Heritage, and to the knowledge
of Heritage no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Heritage and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to
Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries, including without limitation all laws

30 4.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Heritage nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by,
or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since
January 1, 2010, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January

request or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity
that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business
or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability
to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or
its business (each, whether or not set forth in the Heritage Disclosure
Schedule, a " _Heritage Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Heritage or any of
its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2010, by any Regulatory Agency
or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering or requesting any such Heritage Regulatory Agreement.

 

4.16 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar derivative
transactions and risk management arrangements, whether entered into for the
account of Heritage, any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer
of Heritage or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary
course of business and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and
policies of any Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the applicable counterparty) are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Heritage or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance
with their terms (except as may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions),
and are in full force and effect. Heritage and each of its Subsidiaries have
duly performed in all material respects all of their material obligations
thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and,
to Heritages knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

4.17 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Heritage,
Heritage and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have complied, with all
Environmental Laws. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims or actions or, to the knowledge of Heritage, any private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition, on Heritage or any of its Subsidiaries
of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law, pending or
threatened against Heritage, which liability or obligation would reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Heritage. To the knowledge of Heritage, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that

6.3 _Shareholders  Approvals_. Each of Heritage and Washington Banking shall
call a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Heritage Meeting_ " and the "
_Washington Banking Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of (i)
obtaining the Requisite Heritage Vote and the Requisite Washington Banking
Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, (ii)
conducting, in the case of the Washington Banking Meeting, a non-binding
advisory shareholder vote with respect to executive compensation as required
by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, and (iii) in the case of the
Heritage Meeting, if so determined by Heritage, the requisite approval of the
shareholders of Heritage with respect to an amendment to the Heritage 2010
Omnibus Equity Plan to increase the number of shares of Heritage Common Stock
authorized for grant and the individual award limitations under such plan (the
" _Heritage Stock Plan Amendment_ "), and, if so desired and mutually agreed,
upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special
meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement, and each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable and on the same date. The Board of Directors of each
of Heritage and Washington Banking shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Heritage and Washington Banking, as the case
may be, the Requisite Heritage Vote, and, if applicable, the requisite
approval of the shareholders of Heritage with respect to the Heritage Stock
Plan Amendment, in the case of Heritage, and the Requisite Washington Banking
Vote, in the case of Washington Banking, including by communicating to its
respective shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to  _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_, if the Board of Directors of Washington Banking or Heritage,
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
shareholders, such Board of Directors may submit this Agreement to its
shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this
Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto _provided_ , that the Board of
Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the
other party at least three business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action (including,
in the event such action is taken in 

 



39  response to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in _Section 6.12(a))_, the
latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in
any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or
describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at
the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this _Section 6.3_ and will require a new notice period
as referred to in this _Section 6.3_. Heritage or Washington Banking shall
adjourn or postpone the Heritage Meeting or the Washington Banking Meeting, as
the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Heritage Common Stock or
Washington Banking Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the
Heritage Meeting and Washington Banking Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of Heritage and
Washington Banking at the Heritage Meeting and the Washington Banking Meeting,
respectively, for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and
the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve either Heritage or Washington Banking of such
obligation.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.3_ of this Agreement, each of Heritage and Washington Banking
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts
(a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable
to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party that is required to be obtained by Washington Banking or
Heritage or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.5 _NASDAQ Listing_. Heritage shall cause the shares of Heritage Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, Heritage shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees of Washington Banking and its Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits and compensation
programs which are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation programs that are made available to similarly situated employees
of Heritage or its Subsidiaries (other than Washington Banking and its
Subsidiaries), as applicable; provided that (i) in no event shall any Covered
Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Heritage
or its Subsidiaries; and (ii) until such time as Heritage shall cause Covered
Employees to participate in the benefit plans and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly situated employees of
Heritage or its Subsidiaries (other than Washington Banking and its
Subsidiaries), a Covered Employees continued participation in employee
benefit plans and compensation programs of Washington Banking and its
Subsidiaries that are continued by Heritage or a Heritage Subsidiary shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in the Heritage Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Heritage Benefit Plan).

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in
a Heritage Benefit Plan, Heritage shall cause such Heritage Benefit Plan to
(i) recognize years of prior service from the date of most recent hire of such
Covered Employee with Washington Banking, its Subsidiaries or their
predecessors for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, except
under any plan that determines benefits on an actuarial basis, for benefit
accrual, but only to the extent that such service was recognized immediately
prior to the 

 



40  Effective Time under a comparable Washington Banking Benefit Plan in which
such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided that such recognition of service shall not operate
to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same
period of service; (ii) with respect to any Heritage Benefit Plan that is a
health, dental, vision plan or other similar plan in which any Covered
Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate, Heritage or its applicable
Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (A) cause
any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under
such Heritage or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered
Employee to the extent such condition was or would have been covered under the
Washington Banking Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) recognize any health, dental,
vision or other similar expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year
that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
health, dental, vision or other welfare plan; and (iii) for purposes of
vacation or paid time off ("PTO") benefits, service accrued with Washington
Banking from the most recent hire date with Washington Banking, its
Subsidiaries or their predecessors shall be credited for determining a
Covered Employees eligibility and length of vacation or PTO under the
Heritage vacation or PTO plan, and any vacation or PTO taken prior to the
Closing Date (or such later date when PTO plans or programs are integrated)
shall be subtracted under the Heritage plan from the Covered Employees
vacation or PTO entitlement for the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Washington Banking shall take, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably requested by Heritage
that may be necessary or appropriate to (i) cause the continuation on and
after the Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy
relating to any Washington Banking Benefit Plan for such period as may be
requested by Heritage, (ii) facilitate the merger of any Washington Banking
Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by Heritage or a
Heritage Subsidiary, and/or (iii) terminate one or more Washington Banking
Benefit Plans (to the extent permitted by the terms thereof and Section 409A
of the Code) immediately prior to the Effective Time. All resolutions,
notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this Section 6.6(c) shall be subject to Heritages prior
review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(d) Heritage agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, any continuing employee of
Heritage, Washington Banking or any of their respective Subsidiaries who is
terminated without cause during such one-year period and who is not entitled
to contractual severance or change in control benefits will be provided with
severance benefits as described in _Section 6.6(d)_ of the Heritage
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) Each employee of Washington Banking or its Subsidiaries who is a party to
an employment, change in control or severance agreement who is expected to be
retained following the Effective Time has, as of the date of this Agreement
(or with respect to certain such employees, shall have prior to the Effective
Time), entered into a new employment, change in control or severance
agreement with Heritage or a Heritage Subsidiary which shall become effective
at the Effective Time and supersede the existing employment, change in control
or severance agreement. All other employment, change in control and severance
agreements listed in  _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Washington Banking Disclosure
Schedule and the benefits vested under the other Washington Banking Benefit
Plans, in each case with respect to employees, officers, directors and
consultants of Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
who are not retained immediately following the Effective Time, or who do not
enter into new employment, change in control or severance agreements with
Heritage as contemplated in the preceding sentence, shall be honored by the
Surviving Corporation or a Heritage Subsidiary. Heritage reserves the right in
its sole discretion, not to offer continued employment with any such employee
that does not enter into a new agreement with Heritage prior to the
Effective Time.

(f) The Parties agree that the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall be permitted in their sole and absolute discretion, to treat the
consummation of the Merger as a "Change in Control" for purposes of any of the
employment, change in control and severance agreements (or any portion
thereof) set forth in _Section 4.11(a) _of the Heritage Disclosure Schedule.

 



41 (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Heritage or Washington Banking or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Corporation, Washington Banking, Heritage or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of the Surviving Corporation, Washington Banking, Heritage or any Subsidiary
or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Heritage or Washington Banking or any of
their Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with
or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to alter or limit
the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Washington Banking
Benefit Plan, Heritage Benefit Plan, or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of _Section 9.10_, nothing in this
_Section 6.6_, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
third party, including without limitation any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of Heritage or Washington Banking or any of
their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.6_.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, each of Heritage and
the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer or employee of Washington Banking and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "
_Washington Banking Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of Washington Banking or any of its Subsidiaries and
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the same
extent as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by
Washington Banking pursuant to the Washington Banking Articles, Washington
Banking Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of
Washington Banking and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the
date hereof that (i) are disclosed in _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Washington
Banking Disclosure Schedule or (ii) provide for indemnification in an amount
not in excess of $25,000; and Heritage and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred by such Washington Banking Indemnified Party
to the same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as
of the date of this Agreement by Washington Banking pursuant to the Washington
Banking Articles, Washington Banking Bylaws, and the governing or
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Washington Banking or under an
indemnification agreement disclosed in _Section 3.14(a)_ of the Washington
Banking Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that the Washington Banking
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Washington
Banking Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. No
indemnification shall be made pursuant to this _Section 6.7(a)_ if it
violates the provisions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1818(k) or the regulations
thereunder.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Washington Banking
( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to
the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events
which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of 150% of the current annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by Washington Banking for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_
"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Heritage, or Washington
Banking at the request of Heritage, may obtain at or prior to the Effective
Time a six-year "tail" prepaid policy under Washington Bankings existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing single limit (not annual)

 



42  coverage equivalent to the aggregate coverage described in the preceding
sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that
does not exceed in the aggregate 400% of the current annual premium paid as
of the date hereof by Washington Banking for such insurance.

(c) The provisions of this  _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Washington Banking Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.
If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to one or more other entities or
engage in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving
Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.7_.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of
Heritage, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Washington Banking, on the
other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by Heritage.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Heritage and Washington Banking shall each promptly
advise the other party of any change or event (i) that has had or is
reasonably likely, individually or together with other facts, events or
circumstances known to it, to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii)
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually
or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in _Article VII_;
_provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this  _Section 6.9_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of
this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case
unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Heritage and
Washington Banking shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of Heritage Common Stock and Washington Banking Common
Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the Parties hereto that holders of Washington Banking
Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one
dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of Washington Banking
Common Stock and any shares of Heritage Common Stock any such holder receives
in exchange therefor in the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i)
starting with the first quarter of 2014, the Board of Directors of Washington
Banking shall cause its Regular Quarterly Dividend record date and payment
date for Washington Banking Common Stock to be similar to the regular
quarterly dividend record date and payment date for Heritage Common Stock (
_i.e._ , Washington Banking shall move its dividend record and payment dates
for the first quarter of 2014 to approximately February 10 and February 20,
respectively) and (ii) the Board of Directors of Heritage shall continue to
pay dividends on the Heritage Common Stock on substantially the same record
and payment dates schedule as has been utilized in the past.

6.11 _Corporate Governance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Heritage shall use its reasonable best
efforts to adopt the amendment to the Heritage bylaws substantially in the
form set forth in _Exhibit D_ and to effect the requirements and adopt the
resolutions referenced therein. Subject to applicable law, and Heritages
corporate governance process for new directors, eight current directors of
Heritage and seven current directors of Washington Banking shall constitute
the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Heritage shall take all
necessary action pursuant to the Heritage Bylaws to cause, as of the
Effective Time, (a) the number of directors of the Surviving Corporation to be
fixed at fifteen members; (b) eight

 



43  current directors of Heritage, chosen by Heritages existing Board of
Directors, to remain on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation;
(c) seven current directors of Washington Banking, chosen by Washington
Bankings existing Board of Directors, to be added to the Board of Directors
of the Surviving Corporation; and (d) Anthony B. Pickering to become Chairman,
and Brian S. Charneski to be Vice-Chairman, of the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation. Each of the foregoing directors shall serve until their
respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal. If the annual meeting of
shareholders of Heritage to be held in 2014 (the " _Heritage 2014 Annual
Meeting_ ") takes place after the Effective Time, then (i) all of the
directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time shall be
nominated for re-election at the Heritage 2014 Annual Meeting and (ii) if the
above named Chairman and Vice-Chairman are re-elected, they shall continue to
serve as the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors at
the pleasure of the Board of Directors (for two years after the Effective
Time). Prior to the Effective Time, Heritage shall secure resignations from
certain of its existing directors, effective as of the Effective Time, to
accomplish the foregoing. 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Heritage shall take, and shall cause Heritage
Bank to take, such action as is necessary or appropriate to cause the board
of directors of Heritage Bank at the time of consummation of the Bank Merger
to have the same composition and membership as the Board of Directors of
Heritage.

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 6.11(d)_, at the Effective Time, (i) the
current executive officers of Heritage shall continue as the executive
officers of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the current executive officers
of Heritage Bank shall continue as the executive officers of the resulting
institution in the Bank Merger.

 

(d) At the effective time of the Bank Merger, each of the current Chief
Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer of Heritage Bank
shall continue to serve in the same positions; and the current Chief Executive
Officer and President of Whidbey Island Bank shall become the Chief Lending
Officer of Heritage Bank, and the Chief Administrative Officer of Whidbey
Island Bank shall become the Chief Administrative Officer of Heritage Bank,
subject to each of such executive officers of Whidbey Island Bank entering
into a new employment agreement with Heritage Bank in cancellation of his
current employment agreement and any change in control agreement, in form and
substance mutually satisfactory to the compensation committees of the Parties.
All other executive positions at Heritage Bank, as of the effective time of
the Bank Merger, shall be based on merit, as determined by the Chief
Executive Officer and President of Heritage Bank and the compensation
committee of Heritage, after consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and
compensation committee of Washington Banking.

 

(e) The Board of Directors of Heritage and Heritage Bank shall take all
appropriate action to cause each of the individuals set forth in this Section
6.11 to be appointed to serve in the capacities and/or offices indicated, in
each case from and after the Effective Time and until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their officers,
directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event either party
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, such party
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that
the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided
pursuant to the foregoing proviso, such party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms

 



44  no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive
right to negotiate with such party. Each party will promptly (within seventy-
two hours) advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms
and conditions of and the identity of the person making such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep the other party apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. As used in this
Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or
any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of a party and
its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the party, (ii) any
tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of
the consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of the party.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.13 _Public Announcements_. Washington Banking and Heritage shall each use
their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b)
to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required
by applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

6.14 _Change of Method_. Washington Banking and Heritage shall be empowered,
upon their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to
change the method or structure of effecting the combination of Washington
Banking and Heritage (including the provisions of _Article I_), if and to
the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or
desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or
change in any way the type or amount of the Merger Consideration, (ii)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of Washington Bankings shareholders
pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
Washington Banking or Heritage pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a timely manner. The Parties agree to reflect any such change in
an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both Parties in
accordance with _Section 8.3_.

6.15 _Takeover Statutes_. None of Washington Banking, Heritage or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated

 



45  by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.16 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Upon the Effective Time, Heritage shall
assume the due and punctual performance and observance of the covenants to be
performed by Washington Banking under the Indenture, dated as of April 2,
2007, between Washington Banking and LaSalle National Bank Association, as
Trustee relating to $25 million in trust capital securities issued in 2007 by
Washington Banking Master Trust (the " _Trust Preferred Securities_ "), and
the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on the Trust Preferred Securities. In connection therewith, Heritage
and Washington Banking shall execute and deliver any supplemental indentures
or other documents, and the Parties shall provide any opinion of counsel to
the trustee thereof, required to make such assumptions effective.

 

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Washington Banking and
Heritage agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
Washington Banking Insiders (as defined below), both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that Washington Banking Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Washington Banking Common Stock into shares of Heritage Common
Stock in the Merger and the conversion of Washington Banking Stock Options
and Washington Banking Restricted Stock Unit Awards into the right to receive
Heritage Common Stock subject to the terms and conditions of such Washington
Banking Options and Washington Banking Restricted Stock Unit Awards in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the
provisions of this _Section 6.17_. Assuming Washington Banking delivers to
Heritage in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate
information regarding those officers and directors of Washington Banking
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
(the " _Washington Banking Insiders_ "), the Board of Directors of Heritage
and of Washington Banking, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange
Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to
the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Washington Banking Common Stock, Washington Banking Restricted
Stock Unit Awards or Washington Banking Stock Options by the Washington
Banking Insiders, and any acquisitions of Heritage Common Stock pursuant to
_Article I_ by any Washington Banking Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the

shareholders of Heritage or Washington Banking; by action of the Board of
Directors of a party, as follows:

or Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Heritage or Washington Banking if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before May 31, 2014 (the " _Termination Date_ "),

observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Heritage or Washington Banking ( _provided_ , that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have

the case of a termination by Washington Banking, which breach or failure to
be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by
such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true),
would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a) or (b)_, in the case of a
termination by Heritage, or _Section 7.3(a) or (b)_, in the case of a
termination by Washington Banking, and which is not cured within thirty days

to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for
outstanding Heritage Common Stock that has been publicly disclosed (other than

announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal within ten business
days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or (iii) breached
its obligations under _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.12_ in any material

(g) by (i) Heritage or Washington Banking if the Heritage Meeting (including
any postponement or adjournment thereof) shall have concluded with the vote
contemplated for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Heritage Vote required
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger having been taken and the
Requisite Heritage Vote shall not have been obtained, or (ii) Washington

in such event to be damages of such party).

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the

to Washington Banking shall have been made known to senior management of
Washington Banking or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or

(D) prior to the date that is twelve months after the date of such
termination, Washington Banking enters into a definitive agreement or

agreement or with respect to which Washington Banking consummates a
transaction, in either case prior to the date that is twelve months after
this Agreement is terminated).

(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Heritage shall have been made known to senior management of Heritage or has
been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Heritage and (A) thereafter this Agreement is

 



51  terminated by either Heritage or Washington Banking pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_ and Heritage shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Heritage Vote
at the duly convened Heritage Meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof at which a vote on the approval of this Agreement was taken, or (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Washington Banking pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_ (as a result of a willful breach of this Agreement),
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_, _Section 8.1(e)(ii)(B)_, or (C) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)(i)_, and (D) prior to the
date that is twelve months after the date of such termination, Heritage
enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as
that referred to above), then Heritage shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Washington Banking the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same day funds; _provided_ , that for purposes of this  _Section 8.2(c)_,
all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall
instead refer to "50%".

to _Section 8.1(e)(iii)_, then Heritage shall pay Washington Banking, by
wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of
termination.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Washington Banking
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)(A)_, then Heritage shall pay Washington

Acquisition Proposal with respect to which Heritage enters into a definitive
agreement or with respect to which Heritage consummates a transaction, in
either case prior to the date that is twelve months after this Agreement is
terminated).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees payable by a single party under this _Section 8.2_ shall be
equal to the Termination Fee.

 

(e) Each of Heritage and Washington Banking agrees that, upon termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable to it
and such Termination Fee is paid in full, it shall be precluded from any other
remedy against the other party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, at law or in equity or otherwise, and it
shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the other
party or any of the other partys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. It is specifically agreed
and acknowledged that nothing herein shall impose upon a party an obligation
to accept the Termination Fee as the remedy for a willful and material breach
by the other party.

(f) Each of Heritage and Washington Banking acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Heritage or
Washington Banking, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due
pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-
paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying
party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if
Heritage or Washington Banking, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts
payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, then such party shall pay interest on
such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the
date on which such payment was required to be made for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid.

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by
the shareholders of Heritage and Washington Banking; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after approval of 

 



52  this Agreement by the respective shareholders of Heritage or Washington
Banking, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
amendment of this Agreement that requires further approval of such
shareholders under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Parties.

 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after approval of this Agreement by the
respective shareholders of Heritage or Washington Banking, there may not be,
without further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of this
Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval of such
shareholders under applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this

or senior officers of such party. As used herein, (i) the term " _person_ "

limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature, (ii) an " _affiliate_ " of a specified person is any person that

hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference
to this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall require any party or person
to take any action in violation of applicable law.

 

9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



54 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Washington, without regard to any applicable conflicts of
law.

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court sitting in King
County in the State of Washington (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in
connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that
are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue
in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any
objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such
party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given
in accordance with _Section 9.4_.

9.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 9.9.

9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in _Section 6.7_, this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each party hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any
requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 



55 9.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
