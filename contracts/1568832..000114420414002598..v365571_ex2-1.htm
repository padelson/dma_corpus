surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the
DGCL.

(a)   _Options_. At the Effective Time, and subject to the
provisions of this _Article II_ , by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of
any Option, each Option issued, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and
shall be automatically converted into and exchanged for the right to receive,
in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, (i)
an amount in cash (the " _Closing Date Option Payment_ "), paid without
interest at the time the Closing Date Payment is made, equal to the product
of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
issued to the holder of such Option if such Option were exercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Closing Date Payment over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Option and (ii) an amount in cash (the " _Post-Closing
Option Payment_ "), paid without interest at the time the Post-
Closing Payment is made, equal to (I) the product of (x) the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issued to the holder of such
Option if such Option were exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) an amount equal to the sum of
the Post-Closing Payment plus the Closing Date Payment over (B) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option, less (II) the
amount of the Closing Date Option Payment, in each case, less any Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amount of the Post-Closing Option Payment may be made following
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date; it being understood and
agreed that in all cases, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund in respect of Options on
such fifth (5th) anniversary date shall be released to such holders on such
fifth (5th) anniversary (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the first
Business Day thereafter). In the event that the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Option is equal to or greater than
the sum of the Closing Payment and the Post-Closing Payment, such Option will
be cancelled effective as of Closing without consideration and have no further
force or effect.

  



  

(b)   _Restricted Shares_. At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and subject to the provisions of this _Article II_ , by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any Restricted Share, each
Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to be subject to any forfeiture or vesting conditions, such that each
such share of Company Common Stock shall be outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and otherwise treated in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.3_ above; _provided_ , _however_ , that each holder of a
Restricted Share shall also be entitled to receive at the Closing the amount
payable as a dividend in respect of such Restricted Share, as declared by the
board of directors of the Company on August 8, 2013, and held in trust in
respect of such Restricted Share in accordance with the resolution of the
board of directors of the Company (the " _Deferred Dividend_ ").

  



  

 (c)   _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares), Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares), Restricted Shares and
Options shall cease to have any rights with respect to

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the shares of Company Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Restricted Shares or
Options except for the right to receive the Closing Date Payment, Post-
Closing Payment, Closing Date Option Payment and/or Post-Closing Option
Payment, as applicable, to which such holder is entitled in accordance with
_Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_ hereof, as applicable.

  



  

 (d)   _Company Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.4_
and to terminate the Company Stock Plan.

  



  

SECTION 2.5.   _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any
shares of Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who timely
delivers to Company such holder's notice of intent to demand payment for such
holder's shares if the Merger is effected, which holder shall not have voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and thereafter does
not vote in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who is
entitled to, and shall have demanded properly in writing, appraisal for such
shares of Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ " and each holder of
Dissenting Shares, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Closing Date Payment and the
Post-Closing Payment, if any. Such Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Closing Date Payment and the Post-
Closing Payment, if any, in the manner provided in this _Article
II_, without interest. The Company shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to the exercise of
appraisal rights, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments or
notices served pursuant to the DGCL on the Company, and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands in excess of the
payment of the Closing Date Payment and the Post-Closing Payment, if any, in
respect of any share of Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock without the
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Compliance by the Company in delivering notice of any
statutory rights to dissent to holders of capital stock of the Company or in
complying with the DGCL provisions related to dissenters' rights shall not
serve as any waiver of the rights of the Company under Article IV of the
Stockholders' Agreement against any holder who dissents in the Merger.

  



  

SECTION 2.6.   _Paying Agent; Parent Escrow Account; Escrow Fund and
Holdback Escrow Fund; Exchange Procedures_.

--- 

    



  

Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.3(d)_  hereof and Dissenting Shares), Preferred Stock (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ hereof and
Dissenting Shares), Restricted Shares and Options (collectively, the "
_Stockholders_ ") shall appoint a bank or trust company (which bank or trust
company will be reasonably acceptable to Parent) to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") and enter into a paying agent agreement with such Paying
Agent (which paying agent agreement will be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent) for the purpose of paying the Estimated Merger
Consideration and any Additional Merger Consideration to the Stockholders. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Restricted Shares and Options, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to (x) the
Estimated Merger Consideration _minus_  (y) the Escrow Amount _minus_ (z) the
Holdback Escrow Amount (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be used solely to make the
payments to Stockholders of the Closing Date Payment and the Closing Date
Option Payment. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Stockholder Representative. Interest and other income on the
Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be obligated to make any cash payment
of the aggregate exercise price of any Options to the holders of such
Options.

  



  

(b)   _Parent Escrow Account; Escrow Fund; Holdback Escrow
Fund_.

  



  

(i)  As of the date hereof, Parent has deposited, or caused
to be deposited, an aggregate amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee
Escrow Amount (the " _Deposit_ "), as collateral and security for the payment
of a portion of the Termination Fee and the Merger Consideration, into a
separate escrow account established pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement, attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Parent Escrow Agreement_
"), among Parent, the Company and Bank of America, National Association, as
the escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), which amount (together with all
accrued investment income or interest thereon) shall be released by the
Escrow Agent in the following circumstances and in accordance with the
Parent Escrow Agreement:

  



  

(x) at Closing, the Deposit and all accrued investment income or interest
thereon shall be released to the Paying Agent and applied to offset and
reduce, dollar-for-dollar, the Merger Consideration otherwise due at Closing;
or

  



  

(y) if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or
_(f)_ , then the Deposit and all accrued investment income or interest thereon
shall be released in accordance with the Parent Escrow Agreement and _Section
7.2_ hereof.

  



  

   

10 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii)  Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall appoint the
Escrow Agent to act as the escrow agent and enter into an escrow agreement
with the Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (with such changes as the Escrow Agent may
request and as agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent, for the benefit of
the Stockholders, an amount of cash equal to the sum of (i) the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, to constitute the adjustment escrow fund (such deposit,
together with any investment income thereon, the " _Adjustment Escrow Fund_
"), (ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount (together with the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ "), to constitute the indemnity escrow fund
(such deposit, together with any investment income thereon, the " _Indemnity
Escrow Fund_ " and, together with the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the " _Escrow
Fund_ "), and (iii) the Holdback Escrow Amount, to constitute the holdback
escrow fund (such deposit, together with any investment income thereon, the "
_Holdback Escrow Fund_ "). The Holdback Escrow Fund represents an amount to
be reserved on behalf of the Stockholders to cover any expenses and related
items of the Stockholder Representative following the Closing in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Escrow
Fund and the Holdback Escrow Fund shall be held and disbursed in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, all income earned in respect of the Escrow
Fund and the Holdback Escrow Fund shall be for the benefit of the
Stockholders and shall not be distributed to Parent or any Parent Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(c)   _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i)   The Company shall prepare and mail, or cause to
be prepared and mailed, a letter of transmittal (which shall be in
substantially the form of _Exhibit G_ , subject to such changes as are
reasonably acceptable to Parent) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to each
Stockholder. At or prior to the Closing, (A) each Stockholder may surrender
to the Company its Company Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock and/or
agreements representing the Options and/or Restricted Shares (collectively the
" _Exchange Certificates_ "), representing the number of shares of Company
Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and/or Restricted Shares held by such
Stockholder, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and (B) if
so surrendered, the Paying Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time or, if surrendered after the Effective Time, the
date of surrender, pay to such Stockholder the amount of cash to which it is
entitled under this _Article II_. In the event a Stockholder does not deliver
to the Company a Letter of Transmittal at or prior to Closing, such failure
shall not alter, limit or delay the Closing or the conversion of such Company
Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Restricted Shares or the vesting of Options or
Restricted Shares as provided for in _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_ , but
such Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive the payments contemplated by
this

  



  

   

11 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _Article II_ unless and until such Stockholder surrenders the Exchange
Certificates and duly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Company. After
the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall act as agent for payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Exchange Certificates to all
Stockholders who have not so surrendered their Exchange Certificates on the
Closing Date.

  



  

(ii)  Surrendered Exchange Certificates shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Exchange Certificate
shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Exchange Certificate.

  



  

SECTION 2.7.   _Estimated Merger Consideration_. (a) _Estimated Merger
Consideration_. The aggregate consideration to be paid by Parent at the
Effective Time in respect of the Merger (the " _Estimated Merger
Consideration_ ") shall be an amount in cash equal to: (i) one billion, one
hundred fifty million dollars ($1,150,000,000) (as the same may be reduced by
the Financial Advisor Adjustment Amount, if any, pursuant to _Section 2.9_ ,
the " _Base Consideration_ "), _minus_  (ii) the shortfall, if any, of
Estimated Cash as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, under thirty-
five million dollars ($35,000,000), _minus_  (iii) the Estimated Indebtedness
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, _minus_ (iv) the Company
Transaction Expenses; which amount shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Sections 2.8_ and _2.9_ (as adjusted, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(b)   _Closing Date Statement; Payoff Letter(s)_.

  



  

(i)  No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Parent a
written statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth (i)
Estimated Cash as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) Estimated
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, prepared in accordance with the Agreed
Principles, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The
Closing Date Statement shall also include the Payoff Amount. The Company
agrees that it shall provide Parent with such additional information as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with its review of the
Closing Date Statement. In the event that the Stockholder Representative and
Parent agree to revisions to the Closing Date Statement, the Company shall
deliver a revised Closing Date Statement to Parent no later than one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(ii)  No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent form payoff
letter(s) relating to the Indebtedness of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries

form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and shall include a process
for release of all related Liens as of the Closing.

SECTION 2.8.   _Post-Closing Adjustment_ . (a) _Initial Statement_. As
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) calendar days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare in good faith and deliver, or
cause to be prepared in good faith and delivered, to the Stockholder
Representative a written statement (the " _Initial Statement_ ") setting forth
Parent's calculation of each of the following items: (i) Cash, (ii)
Indebtedness and (iii) Company Transaction Expenses, each as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time; prepared in accordance with the Agreed
Principles, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. In
the event that Parent does not deliver the Initial Statement within sixty
(60) calendar days after the Closing Date, each item on the Closing Date
Statement shall be deemed undisputed and the Closing Date Statement delivered
by the Company shall become the Conclusive Statement and shall be final and
binding on Parent and the Stockholders as of such date in accordance with
_Section 2.8(d)_.

  



  

(b)   _Accounting Principles_. The manner in which the Initial
Statement and the Closing Date Statement are to be prepared and Cash,
Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses are to be calculated, pursuant
to this _Section 2.8_ , is that they shall be prepared and calculated in
accordance with the definitions thereof contained herein, using, where
applicable, the same accounting principles, policies, methods, practices,
categories, estimates, judgments and assumptions as were used in preparing
the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012,
except as set forth on _Schedule 2.8(b)_ (the " _Agreed Principles_ "). __

  



  

(c)   _Review and Dispute of Initial Statement_. After delivery
of the Initial Statement, Parent agrees to provide, or cause its employees
(and the employees of the Company) to provide, the Stockholder Representative
and its Representatives with reasonable access on reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours to Parent's and its Representatives
working papers and any working papers of Parent's independent accountants
related to the preparation of the Initial Statement, as well as to any of the
personnel, property and facilities and such books and records and other
relevant information of the Company and its Subsidiaries throughout the
periods during which the Initial Statement is being prepared until the
Conclusive Date, and Parent shall make reasonably available its employees, if
any, directly responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used
in, and the preparation of the Initial Statement, provided that such actions
do not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries. The Stockholder Representative may dispute the
Initial Statement by delivery of written notice thereof (a " _Dispute Notice_
") within forty-five (45) calendar days following the receipt by the
Stockholder Representative of the Initial Statement. The Dispute Notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail all items disputed by the Stockholder
Representative, the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and the
Stockholder Representative's proposed changes thereto, with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation. If (i) by written notice to Parent, the
Stockholder Representative accepts the Initial Statement or (ii) the
Stockholder Representative fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within
the prescribed forty-five (45) calendar day period (which failure shall
result in the Stockholder Representative being deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Initial Statement delivered by Parent), the Initial Statement
delivered by Parent shall become final and binding on the Stockholders as of
the date on which the earlier of the foregoing events

  



  

   

13 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

occurs. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered to Parent, then the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty (30) calendar
days immediately following receipt of the Dispute Notice by Parent (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve
their differences with respect to the Initial Statement or any element
thereof. Any resolution by the Stockholder Representative and Parent during
the Resolution Period as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and
conclusive. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent resolve all disputed
items on the Initial Statement by the end of the Resolution Period, then such
parties shall revise the Initial Statement to reflect their agreement, which
shall then become the Conclusive Statement and be final and binding on the
Stockholders and Parent as of the date of such agreement.

  



  

(d)   _Arbitration_. If the Stockholder Representative and
Parent do not resolve all disputed items on the Initial Statement by the end
of the Resolution Period, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
submit all items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute Notice
(along with a copy of the Initial Statement marked to indicate those line
items which are in dispute, including each Party's proposed determination of
such amounts and reasonably detailed supporting documentation) within
thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the Resolution Period to
KPMG LLP (or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, another
internationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be
agreed upon in writing by the Stockholder Representative and Parent, or, if
such parties cannot agree, as selected by the American Arbitration
Association) (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ") for resolution. The Neutral Auditor
shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator and shall determine only those
items in dispute. Each Party shall (i) cooperate with the Neutral Auditor,
(ii) have the opportunity to make presentations and provide
supporting material to the Neutral Auditor in defense of their positions and
(iii) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide
the Neutral Auditor with access to their respective books, records, personnel
and Representatives and such other information as the Neutral Auditor may
require in order to render its determination. The Neutral Auditor will deliver
to the Stockholder Representative and Parent a written determination (such
determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Neutral Auditor by the Stockholder Representative and Parent)
of the disputed items within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt of the
disputed items, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Neutral Auditor shall not be permitted or
authorized to determine an amount with respect to any disputed item that is
outside of the range between the amounts of such disputed item as proposed by
the Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Notice, on the one hand, and
Parent on the Initial Statement, on the other hand. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor will be
allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative
on behalf of the Stockholders (and subsequently reimbursed pursuant to
_Section 9.14(g)_ ), on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Neutral Auditor
that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by
the Neutral Auditor) bears to the total disputed amount of such items so
submitted. For the avoidance of doubt and solely as an illustration of

  



  

   

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the methodology set forth in the preceding sentence, if (i) the Dispute
Notice delivered by the Stockholder Representative assigns values to the
disputed items such that the aggregate Merger Consideration set forth in the
Initial Statement would be increased by $1,000,000, (ii) Parent maintains
that the Merger Consideration set forth in the Initial Statement is correct
and (iii) the Neutral Auditor's final resolution of the disputed items in
accordance with this _Section 2.8(d)_ is that the Merger Consideration is
increased from the amount set forth in the Initial Statement by $600,000 (
_i.e._ , sixty percent (60%) of the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of
the Stockholder Representative), then the Stockholder Representative shall be
responsible for 40% of such fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor and
Parent shall be responsible for 60% of such fees and expenses of the Neutral
Auditor. The date on which the Stockholder Representative and Parent agree
to, or are deemed in accordance with this _Section 2.8(d)_  to have agreed
to, or the Neutral Auditor delivers, the Conclusive Statement shall be the "
_Conclusive Date_ ". In the event that either the Stockholder Representative
or Parent fails to submit a statement regarding any items remaining
in dispute within the time determined by the Neutral Auditor, then the
Neutral Auditor shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely
submitted to the Neutral Auditor by the Stockholder Representative and Parent.
The determination of the Neutral Auditor shall be final and binding on the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders and Parent, absent manifest

transaction set forth on _Schedule 6.11_ , there are no pending or anticipated
to be sought consents, approvals, applications, authorizations, registrations
or other filings with or from FINRA in respect of any matter involving
Parent or any of its Affiliates other than the application pursuant to FINRA
(NASD) Rule 1017(a)(4) in respect of the acquisition of the Company by Parent
through the Merger that would reasonably be expected to materially impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to perform their obligations hereunder on a
timely basis, or prevent, impede, materially interfere with or materially
delay the satisfaction of the condition contained in _Section 3.1(c)_ prior
to the Initial Termination Date or the timely consummation of the Merger and

SECTION 5.8.   _Financial Capability; Financing_.

copies of (a) the Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof, and
the fee letter associated therewith ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the fee
amounts and other economic terms set forth in such fee letter, none of which
could adversely affect the conditionality, availability, termination or
aggregate principal amount of the Equity Financing, may be redacted), both of
which are from Luxor Capital Group, LP (the " _Equity Financing Source_ "),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the
Equity Financing Source has committed to contribute the amounts set forth
therein to Parent for the purpose of funding a portion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such equity financing, the " _Equity
Financing_ ") and (b) the executed Debt Commitment Letter and the executed
fee letter associated therewith ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the fee
amounts and other economic terms set forth

  



  

   

39 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

in such fee letter, none of which could adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of
the Debt Financing, may be redacted), pursuant to which, and subject to the
terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to lend the amounts
set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding a portion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the refinancing of
certain existing Indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, (i) none of the Management Equity
Commitment Letter or the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified in
any manner, (ii) the respective commitments contained in the Management
Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, (iii) neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, side letter
or other arrangement relating to the financing of the Merger Consideration or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as expressly set
forth in the Management Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter
and the Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto, (iv) each
of the Management Equity Commitment Letter and the Commitment Letters is in
full force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party
thereto, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and (v) no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Management Equity Commitment
Letter and the Commitment Letters that would reasonably be expected to
adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to
consummate the Merger, the Management Equity Financing (as defined below),
the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing. Parent has fully paid (or caused
to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that it or any other party thereto will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Management Equity
Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the condition precedent in the Debt Commitment Letter relating to
the existence of indebtedness or preferred stock as of the Closing
Date). There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of (x) the Management Equity Financing, other than the conditions set
forth in the Management Equity Commitment Letter, (y) the Equity Financing,
other than the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and (z)
the Debt Financing, other than the conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter. The only conditions precedent related to the funding
of the Management Equity Financing on the Closing Date are the conditions set
forth in or contemplated by the Management Equity Commitment Letter. The only
conditions precedent related to the funding of the Equity Financing on the
Closing Date are the conditions set forth in or contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter. The only conditions precedent related to the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in the Debt
Financing Documents shall be the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing when funded in accordance
with the Management Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity

  



  

   

40 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter (and with respect to the
Debt Financing, after giving effect to any flex arrangements entered into in
connection therewith) will be sufficient to fund all of Parent's and Merger
Sub's payment obligations under this Agreement, including payment of the
Merger Consideration and all applicable transaction expenses and financing
costs as set forth herein. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of
the Company's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, Parent does not have
any reason to believe that (A) any of the conditions set forth in or
contemplated by the Management Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment
Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or (B) the
Management Equity Financing, Equity Financing or the Debt Financing will not
be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Parent's obligations hereunder are not subject
to a condition regarding Parent's or any of its Affiliates' obtaining
funds to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

complete copy of which has been delivered to the Company, to purchase at the
Closing shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent, at the price and on the terms set forth in the Management Equity
Commitment Letter.

  



  

SECTION 5.9.   _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties in ARTICLE IV, after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any
alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
the Commitment Letters and the payment of all related fees and expenses,
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) will be Solvent both as of the Closing Date and immediately
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any
Person, shall mean that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (A) the sum of the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities" as of such date, and the capital of such
Person as computed in accordance with Applicable Law as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses
in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and

and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not
have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
mean that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset

dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. Parent is not entering into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

SECTION 5.10. _Indebtedness_. As of the date hereof, (i) none of Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any indebtedness or preferred stock (other than
indebtedness or preferred stock of the type described in Item 1 of Exhibit B
to the Debt Commitment Letter and indebtedness to be refinanced in connection
with the Closing) outstanding, and (ii) the management agreement (as
amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto) between Parent and Management Co is in
full force and effect.

  



  

SECTION 5.11.   _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB contained in this
ARTICLE V, neither PARENT NOR MERGER SUB nor any of THEIR RESPECTIVE
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling
persons, agents or OTHER representatives or any other Person has made or
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty, WHETHER WRITTEN
OR ORAL, on behalf of pARENT, MERGER SUB or THEIR RESPECTIVE Affiliates,

or any of its Subsidiaries be required to make any payment to any Person to

avoidance of doubt, the failure to obtain any of the consents, registrations,
approvals, permits or authorizations referenced above (other than any
approvals or events required pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and
_Section 3.1(c)_ herein) shall not constitute the failure to satisfy a

limiting the generality thereof, (x) the Parties shall (A) prepare and file a
notification with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
pursuant to the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not be obligated prior to the Closing to make or cause to be made for any
Subsidiary of the Company

any claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of such claim or
claims.

  



  

(c)   _Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time the Company
shall, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for, at
Parent's expense and at no expense to the beneficiaries, non-cancellable
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time from insurance carriers with the same or better
claims-paying ability ratings as the Company's current insurance carriers

fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"),
for the persons who are covered by the Company's existing DandO Insurance, with
terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
the Company's existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ that the Company shall not pay, or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall not be required to pay, for such "tail" insurance
policies a one-time premium in excess of 250% of the Company's current annual
premium for DandO Insurance, which current annual premium is set forth on

period of at least six (6) years from the Effective time for the persons who
are covered by the Company's existing DandO Insurance, DandO Insurance with the
best overall terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage reasonably
available for an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. If the Company and
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at
Parent's expense and at no expense to the beneficiaries, DandO Insurance for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for the

conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in such existing DandO Insurance, from insurance carriers with the
same or better claims-paying ability ratings as the Company's current
DandO Insurance carriers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay for such DandO Insurance an annual
premium in excess of the Premium Cap, but, to the extent such annual premium
would exceed the Premium Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective time for the persons who are covered

terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage reasonably available for
an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.

(d)   _Successors_. In the event that, after the Closing Date,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its

SECTION 6.5.   _Labor Matters and Employee Benefits_. (a) For the 2014
calendar year, Parent shall maintain or cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to maintain for each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
that remains employed with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing (the " _Company Employees_ ") the same compensation levels and
employee benefits coverage provided to such employee by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b)  With respect to any retirement (other than any defined
benefit pension plan), medical, dental, vacation, and severance employee
benefit plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries in which Company Employees participate after the Effective Time,
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and
vesting, each Company Employee's service with the Company or its Subsidiaries
(as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to the extent service with such predecessor employer is
recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries) shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries to the extent such
service was recognized for such Company Employee under a comparable Employee
Plan immediately prior to the Closing, and to the same extent past service is
credited under such benefit plan for similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service. Parent shall permit the Company Employees to
carry over and take vacation days with pay in accordance with the applicable
policies of the Company as in effect on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)  Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitation, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements, waiting periods and any other restriction that would prevent
immediate or full participation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
in which the Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be
eligible to participate immediately after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at
work requirements and waiting periods would have been applicable under the
comparable benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all
expenses incurred by each Company

Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) prior to the Closing Date in the
same plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying
such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant
welfare benefit plans in which Company Employees participate immediately
after the Effective Time, as if there had been a single continuous employer.

  



  

(d)  Unless otherwise notified by Parent in writing, prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate
all Employee Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that
include a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), in each case
effective immediately prior to the Closing. If a Company 401(k) Plan is
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence of
such termination pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the
Company (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. To the extent that the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated in accordance
with this Section 6.5(d), (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate in a plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and includes
a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of Section
401(k) of the Code (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), and (ii) if any Company
Employee who was a participant in the Company 401(k) Plan requests a
distribution in the form of a direct rollover (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code) to the Parent 401(k) Plan within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to
accept such direct rollover, including accepting, in-kind, any plan loan then
not in default; _provided_ , that the Parent 401(k) Plan shall not be required
to take any such rollover to the extent that the Company 401(k) Plan does not
have an opinion letter or a determination letter from the IRS upon which it
may rely.

  



  

(e)  On the next regularly scheduled payroll date following the
Closing Date, the payments of the Transaction Bonuses shall be made by
Company checks through the Company's payroll process.

  



  

(f)  The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are intended to be
for the sole benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the Parties hereto, and
nothing in this _Section 6.5_ , whether express or implied, shall create any
third-party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, including any
Business Employees or any dependent or beneficiary thereof. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement of Parent
or its Subsidiaries or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or its
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 6.5_ shall not create
any right in any Business Employee to any continued employment with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries.

issued or made to comply with the requirements of any Applicable Law,
Competition Law or any applicable Order, prior to the Closing, no press
release or similar public announcement or communication shall be made or
caused to be made in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
in which case the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other reasonable time to
comment on such press release or other public announcement or communication
in advance of such issuance or making; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of
the Parties and their Affiliates may make internal announcements regarding
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective
directors, officers and employees without the consent of any other Party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no press release or other public announcement
by Parent or its Subsidiaries shall name any of the Stockholders in their
capacities as such.

  



  

SECTION 6.7.   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, Parent shall pay all Parent Transaction Expenses and the Company
shall, except as set forth in _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ , pay all Company
Transaction Expenses.

  



  

SECTION 6.8.   _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Transfer Taxes_ " shall
mean transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other such taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer taxes).

  



  

(b)   _Mitigation of Taxes_. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall, upon request, use their reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(c)   _Allocation of Tax Liability_. The allocation of Tax
Liability between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period
comprising a Straddle Period shall be made as follows; provided that the
following is set forth solely for the avoidance of doubt in interpreting
_Section 4.12_ :

  



  

(i)  in the case of Taxes based upon income, gross
receipts (such as sales Taxes) or specific transactions involving Taxes other
than Taxes based upon income or gross receipts, the amount of Taxes
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing Tax Period
included in the Straddle Period shall be determined by closing the books of
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary as of the close of the Closing Date
and by treating each of such Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax
Period as a separate taxable year; and

  



  

   

54 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii)  in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis and
not based on income, gross receipts or specific transactions (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the portion of such Taxes attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period included in the Straddle Period shall be equal to the
product of such Taxes attributable to the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period included in the Straddle Period, and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and the amount of Taxes
attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period included in the Straddle Period
shall be the excess of the amount of the Taxes for the Straddle Period over
the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period included in
the Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the amount of periodic
Taxes imposed for such Straddle Period reflects different rates of Tax imposed
for different periods within such Straddle Period, the formula described in
the preceding clause shall be applied separately with respect to each such
period within the Straddle Period.

  



  

(d)   _Filing Tax Returns_. Parent shall timely prepare and
file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the
Company and its subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date in a manner consistent
with past practice. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the
Stockholder Representative a copy of each such Tax Return at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (including
extensions) for the Stockholder Representative's review and comment. Parent
shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by
the Stockholder Representative, except (i) where a contrary position is
required by Law, or (ii) to the extent such requests, if incorporated in any
such Tax Return, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect (relative to the benefit to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting from incorporating such comments in such
Tax Return) on the aggregate liability for Taxes of Parent, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Parent's other Affiliates, taken as a whole, in any
Post-Closing Tax Period, unless the modifications proposed in such requests
are required by Law.

  



  

(e)   _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of and
filing of Tax Returns and the conduct of audit examinations and any
administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax Liabilities imposed
on the Company or any of its Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other
hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including the furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials
necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of
audit examinations or the defense of claims by Tax Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes. Parent shall and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and,
to the extent notified by Parent or the Stockholder Representative, any

  



  

   

55 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

extension thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority.

  



  

(f)   _Audits and Contests_.

  



  

(i)  Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing upon receipt by Parent or its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audit, assessment or Action (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), which
would reasonably be expected to affect the indemnification obligations of the
Stockholders under _Section 8.2_ in respect of _Section 4.12_ , provided that
the failure to give notice will not relieve the Stockholders of any
indemnification obligations they may have in respect of _Section 4.12_ except
to the extent that their position is actually prejudiced as a result of the
failure to give timely notice. Subject to _Sections 6.8(f)(iii)_ and _(iv)_ ,
the Stockholder Representative shall have the sole right, at the expense of
the Stockholders, to represent the interests of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to employ counsel of its choice in any Tax Proceeding
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than a Tax Proceeding involving
a Straddle Period), to the extent the Stockholders would reasonably be
expected to be required to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties under
_Section 8.2_ in respect of the Taxes at issue in such Tax Proceeding if such
Tax Proceeding is resolved adversely, by notifying Parent in writing within
thirty (30) calendar days from the receipt from Parent of the notice described
in the first sentence of this _Section 6.8(f)(i)_ of its intention to assume
control of the conduct of such Tax Proceeding. If a shorter response period
is required by such notice, and Parent has not received the Stockholder
Representative's notification by the time the response to the relevant Tax
Authority is required, Parent may temporarily assume responsibility for such
Tax Proceeding, but shall relinquish control to the Stockholder
Representative if the Stockholder Representative satisfies the requirements
of the preceding sentence in the manner and in the time frame specified
therein. Parent shall be entitled (at Parent's expense) to attend such Tax
Proceeding (whether such Tax Proceeding is conducted in person, by telephone
or otherwise) with its representatives and to receive copies of all material
written communications, materials and submissions related to such Tax
Proceeding received from, or provided to, the Tax Authority and the
Stockholder Representative shall keep Parent informed on a timely basis of
all material developments. If the Stockholder Representative declines to
assume the control of such Tax Proceeding, Parent shall have the right, at
the expense of the Stockholders, to assume control of the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Proceeding; provided that no settlement of such Tax
Proceeding shall be made without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  



  

(ii)  Parent shall have the right, with counsel of its
choice, to represent the interests of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
in any Tax Proceeding involving a Straddle Period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Stockholder Representative may participate in any such Tax
Proceeding at the expense of the Stockholders and the Stockholder
Representative shall be kept

  



  

   

56 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

informed on a timely basis of all material developments with respect to such
Tax Proceeding. The Stockholder Representative's consent shall be required
prior to the settlement of any Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(iii)  In the event the resolution of all or a portion of a
Tax Proceeding with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period the conduct of which
is controlled by the Stockholder Representative could result in an increase in
Taxes or a loss of Tax benefits in a Post-Closing Tax Period for the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, the Stockholder Representative shall control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Proceeding provided that the Stockholder
Representative shall not settle or resolve such Tax Proceeding, if such
settlement or resolution would have such effect, without the consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(iv)   In the event a Tax Proceeding involves Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and Post-Closing Tax Periods and the parties are not able
to separate the periods into separate Tax Proceedings, then the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall jointly control the conduct and resolution of
such Tax Proceeding or portion thereof. Each party shall be entitled to
employ counsel of its choice at its own expense.

  



  

(v)   If there is a dispute between the
Stockholder Representative and Parent regarding the conduct or resolution of
any Tax Proceeding or portion thereof described in _Section 6.8(f)(iv)_ or
the resolution of any Tax Proceeding or portion thereof described in _Section
6.8(f)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , such dispute shall be referred to the Tax
Arbitrator. Each of the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall present
its position to the Tax Arbitrator, which shall decide which position shall
be adopted. The Tax Arbitrator shall not be entitled to accept any other
position, unless the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall so agree in
writing. The decision of the Tax Arbitrator shall be final and binding, and
its fees and costs shall be paid 50% by the Stockholders and 50% by Parent.

  



  

(g)   _Conflicts_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if there is a conflict between this _Section 6.8_ and any other
provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.8_ shall govern and control.

  



  

SECTION 6.9.   _FIRPTA_. Within thirty (30) days prior to or on the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying that the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt
from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

  



  

SECTION 6.10.   _Retention of Books and Records_. Parent shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to retain all Books and Records in existence at
the Effective Time that are required to be retained under current retention
policies for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, and to make
the same available after the Effective Time for inspection and copying by the
Stockholder Representative or its Representatives at the Stockholder

Representative's expense, for legitimate business purposes, and subject to
confidentiality and use restrictions, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice.

  



  

SECTION 6.11.   _Competing Transactions_. From the date of this Agreement
until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, except for
the transactions set forth on _Schedule 6.11_ , Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into any
agreement to acquire, whether by merger, consolidation, business combination,
the purchase of assets or equity or otherwise, any business or Person.

  



  

SECTION 6.12.   _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries will (and the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives not to) directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent or its Affiliates) relating to, or enter into or consummate
any transaction relating to, the acquisition of all or substantially all of

Representatives, with respect to any of the foregoing (whether solicited or
unsolicited) and in any event no later than within forty-eight (48) hours (or
forty-eight (48) hours following the time that the Company or its
Subsidiaries receives written notice thereof in the case of a proposal, offer,
inquiry or contact made to a Representative) if such bona fide proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact is in writing.

  



  

SECTION 6.13.   _Further Assurances_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree that, from time to time before and after the Effective Time, they will
(i) use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to cause the

to consummate the Financing on the Closing Date. Such actions shall include,

any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Parent shall reimburse the Company for
any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and costs incurred in

requested by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.14(b)_ and/or any information
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries expressly for use in
connection therewith, except to the extent such losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties arose out of or
resulted from the fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or intentional
misrepresentation of any 6.14 Indemnitee. The Company hereby consents to the
use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with such financing;
_provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended

 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that none of
the obtaining of the Equity Financing, the Debt Financing or the Management

Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Equity
Financing, the Debt Financing or the Management Equity Financing, or any
alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III.

writing from Parent, specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if it is then in
breach of any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement that would result
in the closing conditions set forth in _Section 3.1_ or _Section 3.3_ (other
than those conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the
Closing) not being satisfied;

  



  

(e)  by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if Parent has
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Parent
contained in this Agreement shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in
either case (i) such that the conditions set forth in _Section 3.1_ or
_Section 3.3_  would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or
failure or as of the time such representation or warranty was or shall have
become inaccurate and (ii) such breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy

Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to  _Section 2.2_ and (iii) the Company
stood ready and willing to consummate such transactions on that date; or

  



  

(g)  by Parent if the Company fails to deliver to Parent within

SECTION 7.2.   _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no further force and effect, and no Party (nor any of its

pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five (5) days after receipt by Parent of a notice of
termination, seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) in cash (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). In the event Parent fails to pay the Termination Fee
within two (2) Business Days after receipt of the notice of termination, then
the Company may, at any time on or after such date, unilaterally deliver
notice to the Escrow Agent and withdraw from the Parent Escrow Account an
amount equal to the Termination Fee Escrow Amount _plus_ all
accrued investment income or interest thereon, and Parent shall remain liable
for (i) the difference between the Termination Fee and the amount withdrawn
from the Parent Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section 7.2(b)_ and (ii) any
additional amounts owned pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_.

  



  

(c)  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Termination Fee and
this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of this Agreement and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent and
Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing when required to do so or otherwise
breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder, then except for the right
of the Company to injunctive relief, specific performance or any other
similar equitable relief pursuant to, and to the extent permitted by, _Section
9.9_ , the Company's right to terminate this Agreement and, if applicable,
receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ , the 6.14
Indemnitees' rights under _Section 6.14(b)_ , and the 6.15 Indemnitees'
rights under _Section 6.15(b)_ , shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their
respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, agents,
general or limited partners, managers, members stockholders, equity owners,
controlling Persons, Affiliates or assignees or any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder, equity owner, controlling Person, Affiliate or assignee
of any of the foregoing, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor or
assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_
") and any Financing Source for any breach, loss, liability, obligation or
damage, including consequential, special, exemplary, indirect or punitive
damages, and upon payment of the Termination Fee following a termination of
this Agreement by the Company, neither any Parent Related Party nor any
Financing Source shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising under or out of this Agreement, the Merger, the Commitment Letters or
any other Transaction Document and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including the negotiation and performance of this Agreement and any
related representations and warranties in connection therewith and including
for any intentional breach hereof), in each case whether based on contract,
tort, equity or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any state, regulation or
Applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate veil, by or through any claim by or on behalf of a Party hereto
or another Person or otherwise (except that

Parent shall remain obligated for, and the Company, the 6.14 Indemnitees
and the 6.15 Indemnitees may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement and Parent's obligations under _Section 6.14(b)_
and _Section 6.15(b)_ ). In no event shall the Company be entitled to the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement with respect to the
consummation of the Closing other than under the circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this _Section 7.2_ and _Section 9.9_. Nothing in
this _Section 7.2(c)_ shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to
expand the circumstances in which Parent or any Parent Related Party may be
liable under this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Company covenants and agrees that in no event will the Company be entitled
to receive the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

(d)  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company is entitled to
multiple rights of termination under _Section 7.1_ , the Company shall be
entitled, in its sole discretion, to elect which right to exercise; provided
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay more than one Termination
Fee. If Parent fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid the amount due
pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent for the
payment set forth in this _Section 7.2_ or any portion of such payment, Parent
shall pay the Company and its Affiliates' costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the payment at an interest rate per annum equal to
seven and one half percent (7.5%) on the amount of such payment from the date
on which such payment was required through the date of actual payment.

  



  

(e)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ , Parent shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event
later than three (3) Business Days following such termination, return to the
Company or destroy, and will cause its Representatives to return to the
Company or destroy, all of the documents and other materials received from the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates and/or
Representatives relating to any of them or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether so obtained before or after execution of this
Agreement, and Parent shall comply with all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , that Parent shall be entitled to
retain one (1) copy of such documents and other materials for regulatory
compliance or legal purposes, and shall not be obligated to purge extra copies
of such documents and other materials from electronic media used solely for
disaster backup purposes).

  



  

(f)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ , the Parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended so that _Section 6_ thereof shall continue in accordance
with its terms for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of such
termination.

any Party or any Party's representatives, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of or compliance

suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of or in connection with:
(i) any breach or misrepresentation of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty made by the Company in _Article IV_ or in the certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ (in each case, except as noted in

equity holder or holder of equity interests in the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries at any time on or after January 31, 2010 and at or prior to the
Closing, whether for breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise, or (C) any
breaches or alleged breaches of any equity holders' agreements, voting
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to claims
of any current or former holder or alleged current or former holder in
connection with or related to any insolvency or similar proceedings regarding
the Company or any of its Affiliates; or (iv) any claim by any Stockholder
arising out of or relating to any action or failure to act by the Stockholder
Representative. From and after the Closing, no claim may be asserted nor any
action commenced against the Stockholders under this _Article VIII_ unless a
Claims Notice has been delivered to the Stockholder Representative by Parent
(on behalf of the Parent Indemnified Parties) on or prior to the date on
which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim
or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section 8.1._

  



  

(b)  Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.3_ , from and
after the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify each of the Stockholders and
their respective Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, shareholders, partners, members and Representatives
(each, a " _Stockholder Indemnified Party_ ," and together with the Parent
Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and each an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), from and against any and all Losses any of the Stockholder
Indemnified Parties may actually suffer, sustain or become subject to as a
result of or in connection with (i) any breach or misrepresentation of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in
_Article V_ or in the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ (in
each case, solely with respect to the representations and warranties being
true and correct as of the Closing Date, or, if made as of a specified date,
as of such date) and (ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement
made hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, and after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and each Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Closing, no claim may be asserted nor any action commenced against Parent

by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties) on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive
as set forth in _Section 8.1_.

  



  

SECTION 8.3.   _Limitations on Liability_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the
cumulative indemnification obligations of the Stockholders under _this
Agreement_ in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow
Amount less any amount paid to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow Account
pursuant to _Section 2.8_. The right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to

Agreement and not previously distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, _Section 2.8_ or this _Article VIII_ and no indemnification or
other payment shall be payable other than from the remaining Indemnity Escrow

(b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Stockholders shall not be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties for
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ to the extent such Losses were actually
included or otherwise actually taken into account in the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses for purposes of calculating the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Stockholders shall not be liable to the Parent
Indemnified Parties for indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than
with respect to a claim for indemnification based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty in _Section 4.1_ ,  _Section 4.2_ , _Section 4.3_ , _Section
4.20_ (collectively, the " _Stockholder Excepted Matters_ "), until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ (other than those based upon, arising out of, with respect to or
by reason of the Stockholder Excepted Matters) exceeds eight million dollars
($8,000,000) (the " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses in excess of the
Basket Amount and, in which case, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification for the amount of such Losses up to the Indemnity
Escrow Amount less any previous disbursements pursuant to _Section 2.8_ or
this  _Article VIII_. No individual claim (or series of related claims
arising from the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) by a Parent
Indemnified Party may be asserted (and no Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification with respect to any such claim or series of
related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) with respect to  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate
amount of Losses that would be payable with respect to such claim (or series
of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) exceeds an amount equal to $175,000, and any such
individual claim (or series of related claims arising from the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances) for amounts less than
$175,000 shall not be applied to or considered for purposes of determining
whether the Basket Amount has been reached. Losses incurred by Parent
Indemnified Parties for any breach of a Stockholder Excepted Matter or any of
the matters set forth in _Sections 8.2(a)(ii)_  through _8.2(a)(iv)_ shall
not be subject to the Basket Amount.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be liable to the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties for indemnification under _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ (other than with respect
to a claim for indemnification based upon, arising out of, with respect to or
by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in
_Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.6_ (collectively, the " _Parent
Excepted Matters_ "), until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ (other than those based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of the Parent Excepted Matters)
exceeds the Basket Amount, whereupon the Stockholder Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to receive only amounts for Losses in excess of the Basket
Amount. No individual claim (or series of related claims arising from the
same underlying facts, events or circumstances) by a Stockholder Indemnified
Party may be asserted (and no Stockholder Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification with respect to any such claim or series of related claims
arising from the same underlying facts, events or

aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable with respect to such claim
(or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events
or circumstances) exceeds an amount equal to $175,000, and any such individual
claim (or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts,
events or circumstances) for amounts less than $175,000 shall not be applied
to or considered for purposes of determining whether the Basket Amount has
been reached. Losses incurred by Stockholder Indemnified Parties for any
breach of a Parent Excepted Matter or any of the matters set forth in _Section
8.2(b)(ii)_ shall not be subject to the Basket Amount.

  



  

(e)  For purposes of (i) determining whether there has been any breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent for purposes
of this _ARTICLE VIII_ , and (ii) calculating Losses hereunder in respect of
any such breach, (x) each representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, "material" or other similar
qualification (but for the avoidance of doubt, not as to specified dollar
amounts) contained in such representation or warranty, and (y) _Section 4.12_
shall be read without regard and without giving effect to _Schedule 4.12_ and
the "to the Knowledge of the Company" qualification in _Section 4.12(i)_.

  



  

SECTION 8.4.   _Indemnification Claim Process_.

  



  

(a)  All claims for indemnification by either a Stockholder
Indemnified Party or Parent Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ shall
be asserted and resolved in accordance with _Sections 8.4_, _8.5_ and _8.6_.

  



  

(b)  If a Parent Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification for
a claim by a third party for which indemnification is or may be available
under this _Article VIII_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , the Parent Indemnified Party shall promptly, but, subject to
the following proviso, in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days
following such Parent Indemnified Party's knowledge of such claim, notify the
Stockholder Representative in writing of such claim, describing such claim in
reasonable detail and the amount or estimated amount of such Losses to the
extent known or reasonably calculable (the " _Claims Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not,
however, relieve the Stockholders of their indemnification obligations
hereunder, except and only to the extent that the Stockholders are actually
prejudiced in any material respect as a result of such failure.

  



  

(c)  All Stockholder Indemnified Parties, acting through the
Stockholder Representative, that intend to seek indemnification for a Third
Party Claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , shall promptly, but, subject to
the following proviso, in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days
following the Stockholder Representative's knowledge of such claim, deliver a
Claims Notice to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not, however, relieve Parent of its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except and only to the extent that
Parent is actually prejudiced in any material respect as a result of such
failure.

(d)  The party from which any Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") shall have fifteen (15) days from the date on which
the Indemnifying Party received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party desires to assume the defense or prosecution
of the Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such claim in accordance herewith: (w) the Indemnifying
Party shall diligently pursue the defense of such Third Party Claim and keep
the Indemnified Party reasonably apprised of the status thereof, including all
settlement negotiations and offers, (x) the Indemnified Party may retain one
additional separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (which shall be
reasonable) and participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim (upon
reasonable prior written notice to the Indemnifying Party), but the
Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation, defense and settlement
thereof, and such co-counsel shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel and one local counsel, if applicable, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party if (1) the Indemnified Party shall have
been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, and, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified
Party, counsel for the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the
interests of the Indemnified Party because such interests would reasonably be
expected to be in conflict with those of the Indemnifying Party or (2) the
Indemnifying Party fails to diligently pursue the defense of such Third Party
Claim in a reasonably timely fashion; (y) the Indemnified Party shall not file
any papers with any Governmental Entity or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); and (z)
the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides
solely for the payment of money and the Indemnifying Party makes such
payment in full (which payment in full shall include only payments from the
Indemnity Escrow Account) and does not involve any admission of fault, guilt
or violation of Applicable Law by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates, and does not impose an injunction or any equitable relief
on the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. The Parties shall act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to all information reasonably related thereto. Whether
or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or
any judgment consented to without the Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(e)  If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within
fifteen (15) days of

  



  

   

71 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnified Party may defend against such
Third Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate, with the
Indemnifying Party responsible for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
in connection therewith (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel),
upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party (i) shall have the right
to participate in (but not control) the defense of the Third Party Claim at
its sole cost and expense, (ii) may at any time thereafter assume defense of
the Third Party Claim, in which event the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel
incurred prior to the assumption by the Indemnifying Party of defense of the
Third Party Claim and (iii) shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Article VIII_ , the Parties shall cooperate with each other to obtain the
benefits of any insurance coverage for Third Party Claims that may be in
effect at the time a Third Party Claim is asserted, and, if any insurance
carrier for the Company, any Affiliate of the Company or Parent is obligated
or agrees to defend any Third Party Claim, such defense shall be tendered to
such insurance carrier and the rights of the parties among
themselves regarding the assumption and control of such defense shall be
subject to the reasonable requirements of such insurance carrier. Nothing
contained herein shall obligate any Party to obtain or continue after the
Closing any insurance coverage for any period.

  



  

SECTION 8.5.   _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The
Indemnified Party will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnifying Party
promptly upon its discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying Party may
be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder that does not involve a Third
Party Claim (a " _Non-Third Party Claim_ "), which Claims Notice shall also
(i) state in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances related to such
Loss and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or claim to
which such Loss is related, (ii) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or
properly accrued Losses or anticipates that it will incur liability for
Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement (and, to the extent known or reasonably
calculable, the Indemnified Party's good faith estimate of the amount of its
Losses), and (iii) if applicable, the date such item was paid or accrued. The
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such matters. Such cooperation shall include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records, documents and reasonable access
to employees, including the individuals set forth in clause (a) of the
definition of "Knowledge," to the extent that such individuals are employees
of Parent or any of its Affiliates at such time, reasonably relating to such
matters as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in order to
determine the validity of the claim, provided that the foregoing does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the Indemnified Party's business.

  



  

SECTION 8.6.   _Calculation of Losses; Limitations; Exclusive Remedy_. (a)
The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article VIII_ shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by any
Indemnified Party under insurance policies with

  



  

   

72 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

respect to such Loss, and (ii) any amounts actually received by any
Indemnified Party from any third party in the form of an indemnity,
contribution or other similar, in each case, after taking into account any
costs and expenses reasonably incurred in collecting such proceeds. If an
Indemnified Party shall have received the payment required under this _Article
VIII_  from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Losses and shall subsequently
receive any insurance payments or other amounts in respect of such Losses,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party an
amount equal to such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received.

  



  

(b)  No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover under this
_Article VIII_ with respect to, and the term "Losses" shall not include, lost
business opportunities (but may include lost profits), any measure of damages
based on diminution in value or based on any multiple of earnings, profits,
cash flow or EBITDA or similar concept, consequential damages of any kind, or
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary and punitive damages, except if, and
only to the extent, such Losses have been awarded to a Third Party against an
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c)  Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it
seeks indemnification under this _Article VIII_  shall be required to use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate the Loss, including taking any actions
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. The Stockholders shall have
no liability for any Loss to the extent such Loss would not have arisen
but for any change in the accounting or other policies, practices or
procedures adopted by Parent or its Affiliates or for any other act or
omission by Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company) after the
Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein
(including any limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ ), following the
Closing, the indemnification provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Stockholders, as applicable, for any claim arising out of this Agreement, and
the transactions contemplated hereby, except as otherwise expressly provided
in _Section 2.8_.

  



  

SECTION 8.7.   _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Stockholders and
the Parties agree to treat, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to
treat, for all Tax purposes, any payment made under this _Article VIII_ , to
the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

SECTION 8.8.   _Subrogation_. No Stockholder shall have any right of
contribution or subrogation against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other Stockholder with respect to any breach by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, in the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ ) in connection with any claim or demand by any Person other
than the Parties or their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party
as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party
may have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against
any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Such Indemnified
Party shall

  



  

   

73 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the
cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting any subrogated right, defense
or claim.

  



  

SECTION 8.9.   _Disputes_. If an Indemnified Party delivers a Claims Notice
in accordance with this _Article VIII_ and the Indemnifying Party objects to
the indemnification claim as set forth in the applicable Claims Notice, the
Indemnifying Party may dispute the related indemnification claim by delivery
of a notice to the Indemnified Party in writing, within fifteen (15) days
following the Indemnifying Party's receipt of such Claims Notice, that the
Indemnifying Party objects to the indemnification claim (or the amount of
Losses set forth therein) asserted in such Claims Notice (a " _Claims Dispute
Notice_ "). Following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the Claims Dispute
Notice, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly use
their reasonable best efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and to what
extent the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification on account of
such indemnification claim. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party are able to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after the
Indemnified Party receives such Claims Dispute Notice, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent setting forth such agreement and, as applicable, instructing
the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account subject
to the limitations contained in this Agreement. If the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days
after the Indemnified Party receives such Claims Dispute Notice, then the
dispute may only be submitted to, and settled by, an individual arbitrator
mutually selected by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (if the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to agree upon the
arbitrator, they shall each select an arbitrator and the two selected
arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as the arbitrator). The
arbitration shall be held in New York, New York pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act and in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
Association. The agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable, the
award rendered by the arbitrator in respect of a dispute pursuant to this
_Section 8.9_ shall be final and binding (absent fraud or manifest error),
and any arbitration award may be enforced by judgment entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be
allocated between the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders), on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted to
the arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such disputed
items so submitted. For the avoidance of doubt, arbitration in accordance with
the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 8.9_ shall be the sole means of
resolving disputes in connection with this _Article VIII_. For all
purposes of this _Article VIII_ , Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall reasonably cooperate with the other party and its Representatives
(including to the extent appropriate and permitted by Applicable Law,
providing information, records and data), and shall permit reasonable access
on reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, as may be
reasonably required in connection with the resolution of such disputes,
provided that the foregoing does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the applicable party's business.

  



  

SECTION 8.10.   _Release of Escrow_. (a) On the first (1st) anniversary of
the Closing Date (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the first
Business Day thereafter), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement to pay to the
Stockholder Representative, acting in the name and on behalf of all of

  



  

   

74 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the Stockholders, the excess of the amounts then available in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund over the aggregate amount, if any, that is the subject of
any Claims Dispute Notices that then remain unresolved in accordance with
_Section 8.9_.

  



  

(b) From and after the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, from time
to time, upon (i) resolution of any Claims Dispute Notice in respect of any
individual claim for indemnification made by the Parent Indemnified Parties
and/or (ii) if applicable, payment to any Parent Indemnified Party of the
amount of such claim from the remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to release to the Stockholder Representative, acting in the name and on behalf
of all of the Stockholders, the excess of the amounts then available in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund over the aggregate amount, if any, that is the subject
of any Claims Dispute Notices that then remain unresolved in accordance with
_Section 8.9_.

  



  

Article IX

  



  

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

SECTION 9.1.   _Disclosure Schedules_. (a) If a disclosure is made in one of
or in any part of any of the Disclosure Schedules, such disclosure will be
deemed to have also been made in each other part of the Disclosure Schedules
to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other part of the
Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its face. The reference to or
listing, description, disclosure or other inclusion of any item or other
matter, including any charge, violation, breach, debt, obligation or
liability, in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed to be an
admission or suggestion that such item or matter constitutes a violation of,
breach or default under, any contract, agreement, note, lease or otherwise.
No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement, Applicable Law or regulation shall be construed as
an omission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. Notwithstanding the use of the terms "material" and
"Company Material Adverse Effect" in this Agreement, the inclusion of any
particular disclosure in the attached Disclosure Schedules shall not, in and
of itself, mean that the item or matter so disclosed is material, is
required to be disclosed or would be likely to constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Such disclosure shall not be used as a basis for interpreting
the term "material," "materially," "materiality," "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar qualification in this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules relating to any representation
or warranty contained in _ARTICLE IV_ with respect to any matter that, if
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, would have been
required to be set forth or described on such the Disclosure Schedules or that
is necessary to complete or correct any information in any representation or
warranty contained in _ARTICLE IV_ ; _provided_ that no amendment or
supplement of the Disclosure Schedules made pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)_
shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty made in
this Agreement for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in
_Section 3.2(b)_ is satisfied or otherwise limit or affect the rights of, or
remedies available to, Parent under this Agreement, including under _ARTICLE
VIII_.

  



  

   

75 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

SECTION 9.2.   _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and duly executed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and Parent, or
in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. No
failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, _Sections 7.2(c)_ , _9.5_ , _9.11_  and _9.17_
, and this sentence (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision
would modify the substance of _Sections 7.2(c)_ , _9.5_ , _9.11_ or _9.17_
, or this sentence) may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in
any manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Debt Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

  



  

SECTION 9.3.   _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party
by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the
other Parties hereto and any attempt to assign this Agreement without such
consent shall be void and of no effect;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and Merger Sub may assign, by operation of law or otherwise, all or any of
their rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned
Subsidiary (other than any such wholly owned Subsidiary that is a
registered Broker-Dealer or a Subsidiary of a registered Broker-Dealer) of
Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment by
Parent or Merger Sub shall (a) be effected or attempted without Parent and
Merger Sub first notifying the Company in writing of such proposed
assignment, (b) adversely impact or materially delay (i) the receipt of the
Equity Financing or the Debt Financing or (ii) the satisfaction of the
condition contained in _Section 3.1(c)_ prior to the Initial Termination
Date or (c) relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective
obligations and agreements under this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 9.4.   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Exhibits
and Schedules referred to herein or delivered under this Agreement), the
other Transaction Documents (including the Confidentiality Agreement) and any
agreement between Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company
and/or the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, making specific
reference to this  _Section 9.4_ constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior express or implied agreements and understandings, whether
written or oral, among the Parties.

  



  

SECTION 9.5.   _Parties in Interest; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon and enforceable
by and against, the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, whether or not so expressed. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person other
than Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholders Representative or
their respective successors or permitted assigns, any legal or equitable
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
the Closing occurs, the Indemnified Persons and the Indemnified Parties are
intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the
protections of, _Sections 6.4_

  



  

   

76 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

and _Article VIII_ , respectively; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the 6.14 Indemnitees and the 6.15 Indemnitees
are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the
protections of, _Sections 6.14(b)_ and _6.15(b)_ , respectively; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any Debt Financing Sources shall be third party
beneficiaries and may enforce the provisions set forth specifically for
their benefit in _Sections 7.2(c)_ , _9.2_ , _9.5_ , _9.11_ and _9.17_.

  



  

SECTION 9.6.   _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may
be executed and delivered with counterpart signature pages or in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original by the Party
executing such counterpart, but all of which shall be considered one and the
same instrument. The execution and delivery of the signature page, including
the electronic delivery of the actual signature, by any Party will constitute
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Party.

  



  

SECTION 9.7.   _Section Headings_. The article, section and paragraph
headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 9.8.   _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, waivers and other
communications (each, a " _Notice_ ") required or permitted to be given under
this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed given if delivered personally or

SECTION 9.9.   _Remedies_. (a)Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy expressly
conferred hereby, and the exercise by a Party of any one such remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other such remedy.

  



  

(b)  The Parties understand and agree that the covenants and
undertakings on each of their parts herein contained are uniquely related to
the desire of the Parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, that the transactions contemplated herein
represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of the
Company and Parent and their respective Affiliates and further agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms and further agree
that, although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such
covenants and undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy
therefor. Accordingly, each Party hereto agrees, on behalf of themselves and
their respective Subsidiaries, that, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other similar equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Parties hereby

  



  

   

79 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall
only be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
cause the Merger to be consummated on or after the 60th day after the date of
this Agreement and then only if (i) all the conditions in _Section 3.1_ and
_Section 3.2_ have been and remain satisfied or waived by Parent (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but
subject to satisfaction of such conditions), (ii) the Equity Financing and
the Debt Financing have been funded or will be funded at the Closing, and
(iii) the Company has confirmed in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded and all
deliveries pursuant to Section _3.3(a)_ and _(b)_ , which by their nature are
to be satisfied or made by actions taken at Closing, are satisfied or made,
it would be willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions for purposes of
consummating the Merger. Each Party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction or specific performance on the basis that (i) the
other Party has an adequate remedy at law, or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent and Merger Sub's
obligations to complete the Merger or the Closing if the Equity Financing and
the Debt Financing have not been funded (or will not be funded at the
Closing).

  



  

SECTION 9.10.   _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction.

  



  

SECTION 9.11.   _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial; Process Agent_. (a)  Each of the Parties (i) consent to submit itself
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal
court within the State of Delaware) with respect to any suit (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees
that it will not attempt to defeat or deny such personal jurisdiction or
venue by motion or otherwise, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any such
suit in any court other than such courts of the State of Delaware, as
described above (iv) irrevocably agrees that any such suit (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) shall be heard and determined
exclusively in such courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, (v)
agrees to service of process in any such action in any manner prescribed by
the Laws of the State of Delaware and (vi) agrees that service of process
upon such Party in any Action shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 9.9_ herein. Each of the Parties irrevocably
designates CT Corporation as its agent and attorney in fact for the acceptance
of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any such
claim or proceeding and for the taking of all such acts as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to confer jurisdiction over it

  



  

   

80

--- 

    



  

before the aforementioned courts and Parent stipulates that such consent and
appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees
that it will not bring any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, located in the Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and, in each case,
appellate courts thereof). The parties agree that any of them may file a copy
of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of knowing, voluntary
and bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably waiving any
objections to venue or convenience of forum.

  



  

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING)
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH
PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT
FINANCING).

  



  

(d)  For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions shall not
override the Parties' agreement to have any and all disputes with respect to
the matters that are the subject of _Section 2.8_ and _Article VIII_ governed
exclusively by arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth
therein.

  



  

SECTION 9.12.   _Time for Performance_. Time is of the essence with regard
to any time, date or period set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 9.13.   _No Right of Set-Off_. Except as expressly set forth herein,
Parent, for itself and its successors and permitted assigns, hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset,
recoupment, or similar rights that Parent or any of its successors and
permitted assigns has or may have with respect to the payment of the Merger
Consideration or any other payments to be made by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement or any other document or instrument delivered by Parent in
connection herewith.

  



  

SECTION 9.14.   _Mutual Drafting_. This Agreement shall be deemed to have
been jointly drafted by the Parties and this Agreement shall not be construed
against any Party as the principal draftsperson hereof or thereof.

SECTION 9.15.   _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any
provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion
thereof), or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to
any Person or entity or any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable by any Applicable Law, Order or public policy, (i) the Parties
shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of this
Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable
provision giving effect to the original intent of the Parties and (ii) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

SECTION 9.16.   _Stockholder Representative_. (a) The Parties have agreed
that it is desirable to designate a Stockholder Representative to act on
behalf of holders of the Company Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Restricted
Shares and the Options for certain limited purposes, as specified herein. The
parties have designated Lightyear Capital LLC as the initial Stockholder
Representative, and the Letter of Transmittal will expressly ratify and
approve such designation. The Stockholder Representative is hereby
appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact, for each Stockholder with full power
of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder with
