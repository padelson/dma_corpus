subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, each Seller shall
sell, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from
such Seller, the Membership Interests set forth opposite such Seller's name on
Annex A free and clear of pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens")

Price"), payable as set forth below in Sections 1.02 and 1.03 and subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 1.04. The purchase and sale of the
Membership Interests and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
referred to in this Agreement as the "Transactions".

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The purchase and sale of the Membership Interests and
the other transactions to be effected pursuant to Section 1.03 (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth

following the date of satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver
by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such
day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied
(or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof) (other than those conditions that, by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
thereof), as soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article
VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the
parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and
date as shall be agreed in writing between Purchaser and Member
Representative; provided, however, that, if the Marketing Period has not ended
at the time of the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by
the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set

Period specified by Purchaser on three (3) Business Days' prior written notice
to Member Representative, and (ii) the second Business Day following the final

the extent permitted by Law, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01, 7.02 and
7.03 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof); provided
further, that in no event shall the Closing take place on a date prior to
April 2, 2018. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date". The Transactions will be deemed effective as
of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed in
writing between Purchaser and Member Representative (the "Effective Time").

SECTION 1.03. Transactions to Be Effected at the Closing. At the Closing:

(a) Each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser, an instrument of conveyance evidencing the transfer of all
uncertificated Membership Interests set forth opposite such Seller's name on
Annex A duly endorsed by such Seller for transfer to Purchaser.

(b) Purchaser shall deliver to each Seller (other than Mr. Roy Kapani)
payment, by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by Member
Representative (such designation to be made at least three Business Days prior
to the Closing Date), in immediately available funds in an amount equal to
such Seller's share of the Closing Date Amount (such share as designated in
writing by Member Representative (on behalf of Sellers pursuant to Section
6.11(b)) in a written schedule setting forth each Seller's share of the
Closing Date Amount by individual payment amount and percentage at least three
Business Days before the Closing Date).

(c) Purchaser shall deliver to ECS Federal Holding Co. a note in the amount
equal to ECS Federal Holding Co.'s share of the Closing Date Amount (such
share as designated in writing by Member Representative (on behalf of Sellers
pursuant to Section 6.11(b)) in a written schedule setting forth each Seller's
share of the Closing Date Amount by individual payment amount and percentage
at least three Business Days before the Closing Date) that earns interest at
the short-term applicable Federal rate and matures two (2) days after the
Closing Date, substantially in the form of Exhibit C.

(d) Purchaser shall deposit with the Adjustment Escrow Agent, by wire
transfer to the bank account designated in writing by the Adjustment Escrow
Agent (the "Adjustment Escrow Account") at least three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, an amount equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount, which
amount shall be held by the Adjustment Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the
"Adjustment Escrow Fund"), subject to the terms of the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement (including Section 1.04(d)(ii)). 

(e) Purchaser shall deposit with the Indemnity Escrow Agent, by wire transfer
to the bank account designated in writing by the Indemnity Escrow Agent (the
"Indemnity Escrow Account") at least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount, which amount shall be
held by the Indemnity Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the "Indemnity Escrow
Fund"), subject to the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement (including Article IX).

(f) Purchaser shall deliver to Member Representative by wire transfer to a
bank account designated in writing by Member Representative at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date the Member Representative Amount.

(g) Purchaser shall deliver to Member Representative a certificate of
insurance or other written evidence in a form reasonably acceptable to Member
Representative of in-force coverage effective as of the Closing under the RandW

(h) Member Representative shall deliver to Purchaser written resignations of
each of the managers of the board of managers (or similar governing body) of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to be effective as of the Closing.

(i) Each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a properly completed Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9.

SECTION 1.04. Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) Not less than three Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser a good faith estimate which shall set forth the estimated Closing
Cash, which shall reflect payment of the Transaction Expenses expected to be
paid prior to Closing and Change of Control Payments expected to be paid prior
to Closing ("Estimated Cash"), the estimated Closing Indebtedness ("Estimated
Indebtedness"), the estimated Closing Working Capital ("Estimated Working
Capital"), the estimated Transaction Expenses to the extent not expected to be
paid prior to the Closing and reflected in Estimated Cash ("Estimated
Transaction Expenses") and the estimated Change of Control Payments to the
extent not expected to be paid prior to Closing and reflected in Estimated
Cash ("Estimated Change of Control Payments"), in each case, calculated in a
manner consistent and in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The
"Closing Date Amount" shall equal the Purchase Price minus the Adjustment
Escrow Amount minus the Indemnity Escrow Amount plus Estimated Cash minus
Estimated Indebtedness plus Estimated Working Capital minus Target Working
Capital minus Estimated Transaction Expenses minus the Estimated Change of
Control Payments minus the Member Representative Amount.

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Member Representative a statement (the "Statement"), setting forth
(i) Cash as of the Effective Time ("Closing Cash"), (ii) Working Capital as of
the Effective Time ("Closing Working Capital"), (iii) the outstanding
principal and accrued interest of all Indebtedness as of the Effective Time
("Closing Indebtedness"), (iv) Change of Control 

Payments to the extent not paid prior to the Closing ("Closing Change of
Control Payments") and (v) Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid prior
to the Closing, each determined in a manner consistent and in accordance with
the Accounting Principles.

(c) During the 30-day period following Member Representative's receipt of the
Statement (as such period shall be extended if and as required under Section
1.04(e)), Member Representative and its accountants and advisors shall be
permitted to review the working papers relating to the Statement. The
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th day
following delivery thereof, unless Member Representative gives written notice
of its disagreement with the Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to
Purchaser on or prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and Member
Representative's calculation (in accordance with the Accounting Principles) of
such disputed items or amounts. If a Notice of Disagreement is given by Member
Representative in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in
accordance with this Section 1.04) shall become final and binding upon Member
Representative and Purchaser on the earlier of (i) the date Member
Representative and Purchaser resolve in writing all differences they have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (ii) the
date all disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting
Firm. During the 60-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Member Representative and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and agree on a final and
binding determination of Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Change of Control Payments, Transaction Expenses and Closing Cash, as
applicable. During such period, Purchaser and its accountants and advisors
shall be permitted to review the working papers prepared in connection with
Member Representative's preparation of the Notice of Disagreement. At the end
of such 60-day period, if no agreement on Closing Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Change of Control Payments, Transaction Expenses or
Closing Cash, as applicable, has been reached, Member Representative and
Purchaser shall submit in writing their positions with respect to any and all
matters that remain in dispute and that were properly included in the Notice
of Disagreement to an internationally recognized independent accounting firm
(the "Accounting Firm") to review the relevant portions of the Statement and
the disputed items or amounts for resolution of any and all such matters. In
making such calculation, the Accounting Firm shall consider only those items
or amounts in the Statement and Purchaser's calculation of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Change of Control Payments, Transaction Expenses
and Closing Working Capital in respect of which Member Representative has
delivered a Notice of Disagreement in accordance with this Section 1.04. The
Accounting Firm shall be an internationally recognized independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Member Representative and Purchaser
in writing. Member Representative and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the
Accounting Firm that it (1), subject to the limitations of this Section
1.04(c), shall act as an arbitrator, (2) shall review only the matters that
were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in
dispute, (3) shall make its determination in accordance with the requirements
of this Section 1.04 and 

based solely on the written submissions of Member Representative and Purchaser
and their respective accountants and advisors, disregarding any adjustments or
arguments of Member Representative inconsistent with or not set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement, and not by independent review, (4) shall, with respect
to each disputed item and the amounts submitted in writing to the Accounting
Firm, determine whether and to what extent, if any, such disputed items are
correct or require adjustment (provided that in all instances, the Accounting
Firm's determinations must be within the range of the amounts set forth in the
written submissions of Purchaser and Member Representative) and (5) shall
render its written decision as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than 30 days after submission to the Accounting Firm of all matters in
dispute. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall
be limited to whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement and
whether the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Cash, the Closing Change of Control Payments or the
Transaction Expenses was done in accordance with the definitions thereof, the
Accounting Principles and this Section 1.04. Any disputes regarding the scope
of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
1.04 shall not be resolved by the Accounting Firm but rather shall be resolved
in accordance with Section 10.10. Any determinations by the Accounting Firm,
and any work or analyses performed by the Accounting Firm in connection with
its resolution of any dispute under this Section 1.04, shall not be admissible
in evidence in any proceeding between Member Representative and Purchaser,
other than to the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations under
Section 1.04(d). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to
the accuracy of Section 3.06 or any other representation or warranty set forth
in Article II, Article III or Article IV of this Agreement or as to compliance
by the parties to this Agreement with any of their respective covenants in
this Agreement (other than in this Section 1.04). Judgment may be entered upon
the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over
the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The Accounting
Firm's determination shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Accounting
Firm that it reached its decision in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 1.04(c). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this
Section 1.04 shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Member
Representative, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail
on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations
shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time its determination
on the merits of the matters submitted is rendered. The fees and disbursements
of Member Representative incurred in connection with its review of the
Statement, its preparation of any Notice of Disagreement and its preparation
of any written submissions to the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Member
Representative, and the fees and disbursements of Purchaser incurred in
connection with its preparation of the Statement, its review of any Notice of
Disagreement and its preparation of any written submissions to the Accounting
Firm shall be borne by Purchaser.

(d) Net Adjustment Amount. (i) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive,
Purchaser shall, within 10 Business Days after the Statement becomes final and 

binding on the parties, pay to Member Representative by wire transfer in
immediately available funds the Net Adjustment Amount.

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, Member Representative and
Purchaser shall, within 10 Business Days after the Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties, jointly instruct the Adjustment Escrow Agent to pay to
Purchaser from the funds, if any, then constituting the Adjustment Escrow Fund
an amount equal to the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount; provided
that if the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount is an amount greater
than the funds then constituting the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Member
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall pay to Purchaser such excess
amount.

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, or if any portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Fund remains after delivery of any Net Adjustment Amount
pursuant to Section 1.04(d)(ii), Member Representative and Purchaser shall
jointly instruct for the immediate disbursement to Member Representative of
the Escrow Funds remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account.

(e) During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 1.04, Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to afford, Member Representative and any accountants,
counsel, financial advisors, investment bankers or other advisors, agents or
representatives (each, a "Representative" and collectively, "Representatives")
retained by Member Representative in connection with any adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 1.04, reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books, contracts, personnel and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries necessary to make an informed assessment
with respect to the adjustment contemplated by this Section 1.04.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the 30-day period
described in Section 1.04(c) shall be extended by the aggregate number of
days, if any, during which Member Representative can demonstrate that
Purchaser shall have failed to afford, or shall have failed to cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and its or their Representatives to
comply with the reasonable access obligation contained in the immediately
preceding sentence.

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the

select a mutually acceptable nationally recognized bank or trust company to
act as escrow agent (the "Adjustment Escrow Agent") in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement with respect to the purchase
price adjustment contemplated in Section 1.04 in a customary form that is
mutually acceptable to Member Representative and Purchaser (the "Adjustment
Escrow Agreement"). On the Closing Date, Purchaser and Member Representative
shall enter into the Adjustment Escrow Agreement with the Adjustment Escrow
Agent.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and Member Representative shall
select a mutually acceptable nationally recognized bank or trust company to

terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement with respect to the
indemnification obligations contemplated in Article IX in a customary form

Indemnity Escrow Agent. 

SECTION 1.06. Member Representative Amount. Concurrent with the Closing, the
Purchaser shall deduct from the Purchase Price due to the Sellers an aggregate

transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the

future obligations of the Member Representative incurred consistent with the
authority granted to it pursuant to Section 1.04 and Section 6.11 hereof and
in the Seller Cooperation Agreement (in the aggregate, the "Member
Representative Amount"). The Sellers will not receive any interest or earnings
on the Member Representative Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Member Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in
any such interest or earnings. The Member Representative shall be permitted to
invest the Member Representative Amount only as mutually agreed by the
Principal Sellers, and will not be liable for any loss of principal of the
Member Representative Amount resulting from the investment thereof, other than
as a result of its gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of
its obligations hereunder or under the Seller Cooperation Agreement. The
Member Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds,
will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate
purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors.
The Member Representative Amount shall be retained by the Member
Representative until any remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund is
released to the Member Representative pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that in the event the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is paid in its entirety to the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, then the
Member Representative Amount shall be retained by the Member Representative
until the General Survival Expiration Date, provided, further, that the Member
Representative shall have the authority to retain any amounts it deems
necessary, in its sole discretion, to satisfy any claim for indemnity asserted
in writing prior to the General Survival Expiration Date. Within five (5)
Business Days after the end of its retention of the Member Representative
Amount, the Member Representative shall disburse to the Sellers any remaining
amount thereof, allocating such remaining amount among the Sellers in the
manner distributions would have been allocated among Sellers in their capacity
as members of the Company pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Company LLC Agreement. For tax purposes, the Member Representative
Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Sellers at the time of Closing.

action, claim, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding pending

and, to the Knowledge of the Company, of the other parties thereto,
enforceable against the Company or such Company Subsidiary, and to the
Knowledge of the Company, against the other parties thereto in accordance with
its terms, except (A) as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

otherwise has the right to use pursuant to a valid and enforceable lease,
license or similar contractual arrangement, all of its material tangible
assets (collectively, the "Assets") free and clear of any Lien other than
Permitted Liens and except where the failure to have such title, would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be materially
adverse to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
otherwise interfere in any material respect with the conduct of the business 

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The assets
owned and leased by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries constitute all of
the material tangible assets that, together with the intangible assets and
rights of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, are necessary to permit

on any of the Membership Interests.

by, and has no obligation under any Tax allocation or sharing agreement, or

of any other person, other than an agreement (i) the parties to which include
no person other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, or (ii) with
one or more third parties made in the ordinary course of business consistent

hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently

Agreement. Purchaser and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary,

series of capital stock of Purchaser is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents or the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 4.03. No Conflicts; Consents. (a) The execution and delivery by

subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent Purchaser from
consummating the Transactions or otherwise performing in all material respects
its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with or
Governmental Authorization from, any Governmental Entity is required to be

that may be required under any applicable foreign Law, 

(B) required solely by reason of the participation of the Company or Sellers
(as opposed to any third party) in the Transactions or (C) that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent Purchaser
from consummating the Transactions or otherwise performing in all material
respects its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 4.04. Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person, other than Wells Fargo Securities and American Discovery
Capital, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Purchaser, is entitled
to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Purchaser.

Section 4.05. Capital Resources. Purchaser has accepted and provided to the
Company a true, correct and complete copy of the executed debt commitment
letter, dated on or prior to the date hereof, among Purchaser, Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (as amended,
modified or replaced, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes attached
thereto, collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter") and the fee letters
referred to therein (such fee letters, the "Debt Fee Letters" and, together
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Debt Commitment Documents"), each of
which has been redacted with respect to the fees, expenses, pricing and
certain other economic terms and sublimits (including market flex) that do not
affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability at Closing or amount
at Closing of the Debt Financing. Pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Documents, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association has committed, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions thereof (including, without limitation,
the market flex provisions thereof), to lend the amounts set forth therein for
purposes including the financing of the Transactions and related fees and
expenses (the "Debt Financing"). As of the date hereof, no Debt Commitment
Document has been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived in any
manner prohibited by Section 6.14 of this Agreement, except, in each case,
with the prior written consent of the Member Representative (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, no such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver is
contemplated; and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have
not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment
Letter constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, the valid and legally binding obligation of the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto to provide the Debt Financing subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and, in each case, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, receivership or
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by
general principles of equity. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing
other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Documents, and other than the
terms of the Debt Financing set forth in Debt Fee Letters, there are no side
letters or other contracts or arrangements (oral or written) related to the
Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, no event has occurred which, 

with or without notice, lapse of time or both, (i) would or would reasonably
be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser or any
of the other parties to the Debt Commitment Documents under any term of the
Debt Commitment Documents which would be reasonably likely to result in any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated to be available at the Closing to
be unavailable at Closing or (ii) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 hereof, otherwise would be reasonably
likely to result in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated to be
available at the Closing to be unavailable at Closing. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Sections
7.01 and 7.02 hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that it or any of the
other parties to the Debt Commitment Documents will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition to the Debt Commitment Documents or that
any portion of the Debt Financing to be made available thereunder at Closing
will otherwise not be available to Purchaser on a timely basis to consummate
the Transactions. The net proceeds contemplated from the Debt Financing to be
funded at Closing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Documents, will, in the aggregate, together with all cash and cash equivalents
of Purchaser, be sufficient on the Closing Date for Purchaser to satisfy all
of Purchaser's payment obligations that are due at Closing under this
Agreement, including payment of all related fees and expenses payable at
Closing by Purchaser in connection with the Transactions and all the
obligations payable at Closing under Article I. Purchaser has fully paid all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the Debt Commitment Documents.

Section 4.06. Litigation. There is no civil, criminal or administrative suit,
action, claim, hearing, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding pending
or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent Purchaser from consummating the Transactions or otherwise
performing in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement.
There are no Judgments outstanding against Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent Purchaser from consummating the Transactions or otherwise
performing in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement.
Purchaser is not a party to or subject to the provisions of any Judgment that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent
Purchaser from consummating the Transactions or otherwise performing in all
material respects its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 4.07. Solvency. Assuming (i) the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 (other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver thereof), (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article II and Article III, and after giving effect to
the Transactions and the satisfaction of all of Purchaser's obligations under
this Agreement, including the obligations under Article I and Section 6.08,
and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all related fees and 

expenses (iii) the most recent financial forecasts of the Company made
available to Purchaser have been prepared in good faith upon assumptions that
were and continue to be reasonable and (iv) performance by Sellers, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries of their respective obligations
hereunder, Purchaser and its subsidiaries will be, on a consolidated basis,
Solvent as of the Closing and immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent", when
used with respect to any person, means that, as of any date of determination,
(a) its financial condition is such that the present "fair saleable value" of
its assets is greater than the amounts required to pay its probable liability
on its existing debts as they mature, (b) such person will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date or (c) such person will be able to pay its liabilities (including
contingent and other liabilities) as they mature. For purposes of the
foregoing definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities (including contingent and other
liabilities) as they mature" means that such person will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

Section 4.08. Purchaser's Due Diligence. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that,
except for the matters that are expressly covered in Article II or Article
III, neither Sellers nor the Company have made any other representation or
warranty and Purchaser is conducting its own investigation and analysis in
entering into this Agreement, the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, which are the product of
arm's-length negotiations. Purchaser is an informed and sophisticated
participant in the Transactions, the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and has undertaken such
investigation, and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information, as it has deemed necessary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement.

(b) Except as expressly set forth in Article II and Article III of this
Agreement and any Ancillary Document, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that:

(i) it is acquiring (A) the Company without any representation or warranty,
express or implied, including any representation or warranty as to the
merchantability, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case by the Company, the Sellers,
or any of its or their Representatives, and (B) the Company and each Company
Subsidiary on an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis; and

(ii) no representation or warranty has been made regarding any information,
whether written or oral, including any information, documents or material made
available to it or its Representatives in connection with the 

Transactions or any financial projections of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

Additional Agreements

Section 6.01. Access to Information. The Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, afford to Purchaser's officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Closing Date, to
all their respective books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to, furnish promptly to Purchaser all available information concerning its
business and personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request; provided, however,
that the Company may withhold, and may cause the Company Subsidiaries to
withhold, (a) any document or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party or attorney-client privilege or
(b) such portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or
portions thereof) or information, as reasonably determined by the Company
based on advice from the Company's counsel, might reasonably result in
antitrust difficulties for the Company or its affiliates. If any material is
withheld by the Company pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, the
Company shall inform Purchaser as to the general nature of what is being
withheld. All information provided by the Company pursuant to this Section
6.01 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated October 21, 2017,
between the Company and Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

Section 6.02. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Purchaser, Sellers and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including: 

(i) causing the waiting period under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the
earliest practicable date (the "HSR Approval"), including by filing or causing
to be filed as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than February 9,
2018 after the date hereof, with the Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division any notifications required to
be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Transactions;

(ii) obtaining in an expeditious manner all other necessary actions or
nonactions, Consents, Governmental Authorizations and Orders (including with
respect to the HSR Approval) from Governmental Entities in connection with the
authorization, execution, delivery, performance and consummation of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Transactions;

(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 45 days
after the date hereof, making or causing to be made all necessary
notifications, applications and filings with respect to any other required
Consents, Governmental Authorizations and Orders, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with
respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Transactions
required under or with respect to the HSR Approval and any other such
Consents, Governmental Authorizations and Orders; provided, however, that
Member Representative, the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate with each
other in connection with determining whether any action by or in respect of,
or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the
Transactions (including with respect to the HSR Approval) and seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings; and

(iv) executing and delivering any additional instruments reasonably necessary
to consummate the Transactions.

(b) General Procedures. In good faith consultation with Member Representative
(on behalf of Sellers), Purchaser shall coordinate the overall development of
the positions to be taken and the regulatory actions to be requested in such
applications and filings for approval of the matters contemplated by this
Agreement that require regulatory approval and of all other regulatory matters
incidental thereto that are to be addressed in such applications and filings.
Sellers, the Company and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing under the rules and
regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the Transactions.
Purchaser shall consult, in good faith, with Member Representative, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of any communications,
meetings or other contacts, formal or informal, oral or written, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions (including with
respect to the HSR Approval) or any related declaration, filing, registration,
notice, authorization, consent or approval, and shall provide Member
Representative, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with 

advance notice and an opportunity to attend all meetings and oral
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing.
Purchaser will provide Member Representative, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon
and will consider in good faith the views of Member Representative, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with all written
communications with a Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions
(including with respect to the HSR Approval) and will promptly provide Member
Representative, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with copies of all
written communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to the
Transactions (including with respect to the HSR Approval). Neither Purchaser
nor Member Representative shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing
at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, no party to this Agreement shall acquire or make an
investment in, or agree to do either, any Person or any division or unit
thereof that would reasonably be expected to prevent or cause a material delay
in the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(a). Nothing in
this Section 6.02 will apply to or restrict communications or other actions by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with or with respect to Governmental
Entities in connection with their business in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment asserted by any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining the HSR Approval applicable
to Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best
efforts to avoid entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction
or other decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Transactions, including (i) the proffer and agreement by Purchaser of its
willingness to propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of assets or businesses of Purchaser or the Company or any of
their respective subsidiaries or (ii) in the event that any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, judgment, determination or
decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered
or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make
consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the Transactions, any and all steps (including the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by clause (ii) of this paragraph) necessary to resist, vacate, modify,
reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or
threatened injunction, decision, judgment, determination or decree so as to
permit such consummation as promptly as practicable. Nothing in this Section
6.02(c) nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall obligate Purchaser to
agree to (A) the taking of any action or the imposition of any terms,
conditions, limitations or standards of service the effectiveness or
consummation of which is not 

conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing or (B) any divestitures or
other actions or remedies that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on Purchaser and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers shall not be required to, and Purchaser shall not, in connection with
obtaining any consents or approvals hereunder, or in connection with otherwise
complying with any provisions of this Agreement, consent to (x) the taking of
any action or the imposition of any terms, conditions, limitations or
standards of service the effectiveness or consummation of which is not
conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing or (y) the imposition of any
terms, conditions or limitations on or with respect to Sellers, any of its
affiliates, any of their respective businesses or any of the benefits to
Sellers and its affiliates of the Transactions.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.02, each party hereto shall, subject to applicable Laws including applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information: (i) give the other parties
prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or legal proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any
communication to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.
Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Transactions. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law
and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal
proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the
other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and
supervision over their business operations.

Section 6.03. Notification. Each of Sellers and the Company shall give prompt
notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Sellers and the
Company, of (i) the breach or failure to be true and correct of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to be true and correct would give rise to the failure of a
condition in Section 7.02(a), 7.02(b) or 7.03(a), 

as applicable, (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, (iii) any Change that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or would be reasonably likely to prevent the Company,
a Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, from consummating the Transactions and
performing in all material respects its obligations hereunder; and (iv) any
notice or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of
such person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions;
provided, however, that in the event any party hereto fails to promptly notify
the other parties hereto in accordance with this clause (iv), such party shall
not be deemed to have breached this clause (iv), and such party shall have no
post-Closing liability to the other parties except to the extent such other
party or parties are actually prejudiced thereby; provided, however, that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the satisfaction of the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

Section 6.04. Public Announcements. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions will be issued at
such time and in such manner as mutually agreed to by Member Representative
and Purchaser; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit any
party from making, issuing or releasing any announcements, statements or
acknowledgments that such party is required to make, issue or release by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or listing rules of a
securities exchange or trading market or inter-dealer quotation system
(provided that such party has used reasonable efforts to give the other party
prior notice thereof to review such disclosure). For the avoidance of doubt,
each of Purchaser and Member Representative may make any public statement to
the press, analysts, investors, lenders, rating agencies, proxy advisory firms
or those attending industry conferences, so long as such statements are
substantially similar to previous public press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by Member Representative and Purchaser (or
individually, if approved by the other party). Member Representative and
Purchaser will consult with each other concerning the means by which the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, employees, customers, and suppliers and
others having dealings with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be
informed of the Transactions.

Section 6.05. Benefits. (a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending one year following the Closing Date (the "Continuation Period"),
Purchaser shall provide, or cause its subsidiaries (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) to provide, subject to such Company Employee's
continuous employment during the Continuation Period, with (A) base salary or
base wage and target annual cash opportunities to each employee of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (a "Company
Employee") that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the base
salary or base wage and target annual cash opportunities (excluding equity-
based compensation and any transaction or retention bonus) provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) benefits to
such Company Employee that, in the aggregate, are substantially 

comparable to the benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall provide
each Company Employee with terms and conditions of employment as required by
applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, honor
all obligations under the Benefit Plans and Benefit Agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, cause any "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA) maintained
by Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) to
recognize each Company Employee's service with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with such predecessor is
recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting,
benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies; provided, however, that such
service shall not be recognized for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement
benefits or to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.

(d) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any
of its subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) to, recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date.

(e) Prior to making any material written communications or broad-based oral
communications (for which written materials are prepared) to Company Personnel
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
Transaction, the Company shall provide Purchaser with a copy of the intended 

communication, Purchaser shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments
in good faith.

(f) Within 30 days following the date of the Agreement, Purchaser and the
Company shall determine in good faith the Company Employees who will be
granted restricted stock units and the amount to be granted to each such
Company Employee, subject to their ongoing employment following the Closing
under Purchaser's 2012 Amended and Restated Employment Inducement Award Plan.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall (i)
create any right in any employee to continued employment by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or affiliates, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary
thereof, or preclude the ability of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
affiliates, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary thereof to terminate the
employment of any employee for any reason, except as set forth in Section
6.05(a) or (ii) prevent Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Closing,
any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement in accordance with their terms. This
Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.05,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.05 or
is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or policy of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Purchaser or any respective subsidiary
thereof. No Company Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.05 and this Section 6.05 shall not create
such rights in any such person.

Section 6.06. Taxes. (a) All stock transfer, equity transfer, real estate
transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes incurred in
connection with the Transactions ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne equally by
Purchaser on the one hand, and the Sellers (pro rata in accordance with each
Seller's share of the Purchase Price) on the other hand. The parties to this
Agreement shall cooperate as reasonably requested of each other in the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return in respect of Transfer Taxes and in
obtaining any available exemption from, or reduction of, Transfer Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be responsible for 100% of any
Transfer Taxes to the extent such Taxes are recoverable from the applicable
Governmental Entity by Purchaser or the Company in Purchaser's reasonable
discretion.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, from any consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, such amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under the Code and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes, and
shall timely remit amounts so withheld or deducted to the appropriate Tax
authority in accordance with applicable Law; provided 

that, Purchaser shall notify the Member Representative, in writing, prior to
the Closing, of any amount Purchaser intends to withhold on payments made on
the Closing Date under this Section 6.06(b). To the extent that Purchaser
deducts or withholds in accordance with the foregoing and timely remits such
amount withheld or deducted to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld or
deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. Purchaser agrees to take commercially reasonable actions requested in
writing by the Member Representative to avoid or mitigate the imposition of
any withholding Taxes with respect to amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

(c) Member Representative shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, when due (taking into account all applicable extensions) (i) all Tax
Returns (other than any Company Pass-through Tax Returns) of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that are required to be filed (taking into account all
applicable extensions) on or before the Closing Date (a "Seller-Prepared Tax
Return") and (ii) with respect to the Company, any IRS Form 1065, any Schedule
K-1 and any similar state, local or other Tax Return for reporting "pass
through" income, in each case for any taxable period that ends on or before
the Closing Date (any such taxable period, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period", and any
such Tax Return described in clause (ii), a "Company Pass-through Tax
Return"). Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
when due (taking into account all applicable extensions) all other Tax Returns
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and all
Tax Returns for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (any such taxable period, a "Straddle Period", and any such Tax
Return described in this sentence, a "Purchaser-Prepared Tax Return). All
Purchaser-Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is
consistent with the past practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
to the extent such past practice is consistent with applicable Law. Purchaser
shall present each Purchaser-Prepared Tax Return to the Member Representative
for review and comment at least 30 days prior to the date on which such Tax
Return is required to be filed. Purchaser and Member Representative shall act
reasonably and in good faith to resolve any objection properly and timely
raised by Member Representative with respect to any Purchaser-Prepared Tax
Return. If the Member Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve any
issues by the date that is the later of (i) 15 days after the date of receipt
by the Member Representative of the applicable Tax Return to be reviewed and
(ii) 30 days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be
filed, then the Member Representative and Purchaser jointly shall engage the
Accounting Firm to determine the correct treatment of the issues in dispute.
Sellers, on the one hand (pro rata in accordance with each Seller's share of
the Purchase Price), and Purchaser, on the other, shall bear and pay one-half
of the fees and other costs charged by the Accounting Firm for such
determination. Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto.

(d) Neither Purchaser nor any of its affiliates shall (or shall cause or
permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to) amend or refile any Tax
Return of 

the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any taxable period beginning prior
to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Member
Representative if any Seller would be liable for Taxes in respect thereof.

(e) For purposes of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.09, the indemnity therefor under Section 9.01(a)(i) and the indemnity under
Section 9.01(a)(iv), "Pre-Closing Taxes" means, with respect to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, (i) all Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, and (ii) with respect to any Straddle Period, all Taxes allocated
to the portion of a Straddle Period that is up to and including the Closing
Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of Taxes that are
allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period up to and including the Closing
Date shall (x) in the case of any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts
or payroll, be determined based upon an interim closing of the books and
hypothetical closing of the taxable year as of the Closing Date, and (y) in
the case of any other Tax, be prorated based on the number of days in such
period up to the Closing Date relative to the total number of days in such
period.

(f) Any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date shall be for the account of Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay
the amount of any such refund or credit to the Member Representative. All
other refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall belong to Purchaser. Any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned in accordance
with the allocation principles set forth in Section 6.06(e). Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall, or shall cause their
affiliates to, pay to the other party the portion of any such refund or credit
of Taxes to which such other party is entitled under this Section 6.06(f), in
the case of a refund, within ten (10) days after such refund is received, or
in the case of a credit, within ten days after such credit is allowed or
applied against other Tax liabilities; provided, however, that if any portion
of such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed by any taxing authority,
the amounts previously paid in respect thereof under this Section 6.06(f)
shall be promptly reimbursed by the payee to the payor. With respect to any
item of Taxes reflected in Closing Working Capital as a Current Liability, to
the extent the actual amount of such liability for such item is less than the
corresponding amount so reflected in Closing Working Capital, such shortfall
shall be treated as a credit of Taxes for purposes of this Section 6.06(f).

(g) If Purchaser or any of its affiliates receives notice of a Tax audit,
examination, claim, dispute, investigation or other proceeding, in each case
that relates to the Company or any Company Subsidiary (a "Tax Proceeding")
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, then Purchaser
shall notify the Member Representative within ten (10) days after receipt of
such notice; provided, however, that the failure to timely provide such notice
shall not release the Sellers from any indemnification obligation under this
Agreement except to the extent any Sellers are actually prejudiced thereby.
Purchaser's notification to the Member Representative shall 

contain factual information describing the Tax Proceeding in reasonable detail
and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any
taxing authority in respect of any such Tax Proceeding.

(h) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
the Member Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of the
Tax Proceeding. To the extent the Member Representative elects to control the
Tax Proceeding, the Member Representative shall notify Purchaser of its intent
to do so within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Tax Proceeding, and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate, in each phase of such Tax
Proceeding. If the Member Representative elects not to control the Tax
Proceeding, Purchaser or the Company shall assume control of such Tax
Proceeding. In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period,
Purchaser shall have the right to control such Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the party not in control of a Tax Proceeding shall have the
following rights: (i) the party in control shall keep the other party informed
on a prompt basis regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax
Proceeding, including by providing the other party with all written materials
relating to such Tax Proceeding submitted to and received from the relevant
taxing authority, (ii) the party not in control shall be entitled to
participate in such Tax Proceeding, including by having an opportunity to
comment on any written materials prepared in connection with such Tax
Proceeding and attending any conferences relating thereto and (iii) the party
in control shall not compromise, settle or resolve such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the other party's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(i) None of Purchaser, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective affiliates shall waive any statute of limitations or agree to any
extensions thereof in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries without the prior written consent
of the Member Representative.

(j) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause its affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to reasonably
cooperate, with the Member Representative with respect to matters addressed by
this Section 6.06, including by maintaining and making available to the Member
Representative all records reasonably necessary for the filing of any Company
Pass-through Tax Returns or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding that relates to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period. Purchaser agrees to retain, or
cause to be retained, all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
assets and activities relating to taxable periods beginning prior to the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable period for assessment
under applicable Law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) and
to abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered
into with any taxing authority. 

(k) For U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, consistent with Rev. Rul. 99-6,
1991-1 C.B. 432, Situation 2, the parties shall treat the purchase and sale of
the Membership Interests as a sale by the members of the Company of their
interests in the Company and as a purchase by Purchaser of (i) the assets
owned, as of the Closing, by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as
applicable), and an assumption by Purchaser of any liabilities, as of the
Closing, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as applicable) and (ii)
the stock of KSH Solutions.

(l) The Purchase Price and the amount of liabilities treated as having been
assumed by Purchaser for Tax purposes shall be allocated among the assets
owned as of the Closing by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (as
applicable) and the stock of KSH Solutions in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code, in a manner that is mutually acceptable to the parties and according
to a schedule arrived at pursuant to the following procedure (such allocation,
the "Purchase Price Allocation"):

(i) No later than 90 days after the Closing Date, the Member Representative
shall present a draft Purchase Price Allocation to Purchaser for review and
comment. Purchaser shall notify the Member Representative of any objections
within 30 days after receipt by Purchaser of the draft Purchase Price
Allocation, and the Member Representative shall consider such objections in
good faith and address all reasonable objections.

(ii) If the parties cannot resolve any dispute regarding the draft Purchase
Price Allocation within 15 days of the Member Representative's receipt of the
Purchaser's written objections, then the Accounting Firm shall resolve any
remaining disagreements.

(iii) Thereafter, the Member Representative and Purchaser shall cooperate to
update the Purchase Price Allocation to reflect adjustments to the purchase
price contemplated by this Agreement, and any dispute with respect to such
updates to the Purchase Price Allocation shall be referred for resolution in
accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 6.06(l)(ii).

(iv) The parties hereto agree to be bound by the Purchase Price Allocation for
all Tax purposes and to file all Tax Returns consistent with the final
Purchase Price Allocation.

(m) The parties hereto shall treat the Change of Control Payments and the
Transaction Expenses (subject to the following sentence), and all Tax
deductions in respect of the foregoing, as accruing on or before the Closing
Date, and no party hereto shall take any position to the contrary on any Tax
Return. To the extent any amount (or portion thereof) of any Transaction
Expenses is a "success-based fee" within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2011-29,
70% of such amount (or portion thereof) shall be treated as accruing on or
before the Closing Date. 

Section 6.07. Indemnification. (a) Purchaser shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to honor all
the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' obligations to indemnify
(including all obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current or
former directors, officers or managers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for acts or omissions by such directors, officers and managers
occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such obligations of the
Company or such Company Subsidiary exist on the date of this Agreement,
whether pursuant to the Company Certificate of Formation, the Company LLC
Agreement, the respective charters or bylaws of the Company Subsidiaries,
individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall
survive the Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with the current terms of the Company Certificate of Formation, the
Company LLC Agreement, the respective charters or bylaws of the Company
Subsidiaries and such individual indemnity agreements from the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
any claims against such directors, officers or managers arising out of such
acts or omissions.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for
the extension of the directors', officers' and managers' liability coverage of
the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' existing directors', officers' and
managers' insurance policies, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Closing Date with respect to any claim
related to any period or time at or prior to the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's or
the Company Subsidiaries', as the case may be, current insurance carrier with
respect to directors', officers' and managers' liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under
the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' existing policies existed or
occurred at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions).

Section 6.08. Indebtedness. Purchaser shall or shall cause the Company to
pay, by wire transfer of cash in immediately available funds pursuant to
written instructions specified by Member Representative, the amounts specified
in a written notice to be provided by Member Representative to Purchaser at
least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Repayment Amount")
to the lenders (or an administrative agent on their behalf) under the
Indebtedness specified in Section 6.08 of the Company Disclosure Letter or any
Indebtedness incurred prior to the Closing Date to refinance or replace such
Indebtedness, for the account of the lenders of such Indebtedness immediately
following the Closing against delivery by such lenders (or an administrative
agent on their behalf) of documentation evidencing the termination of any
commitments under such Indebtedness and the release (without further action by
any part) as of the Closing of (i) the Company and each Company Subsidiary
from its respective obligations under such Indebtedness (other than any
customary contingent indemnification obligations that by their terms survive
the repayment of such Indebtedness) and (ii) the Liens securing such
Indebtedness and related security 

agreements on the capital stock of the Company and any Company Subsidiary and
all collateral securing such Indebtedness that is owned by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

Section 6.09. Insurance. Purchaser acknowledges that the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not be entitled to coverage under any insurance
policies maintained by any Seller or its affiliates (other than directly by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) from and after the Closing.

Section 6.10. Settlement of Intercompany Notes. All intercompany loans for
borrowed money evidenced by notes between and among the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Seller and any of its
subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the
other hand and set forth on Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
shall be eliminated (which may include the netting of receivables and
payables, capital contributions and dividends) prior to the Closing and such
eliminations shall be reflected in the Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness,
Estimated Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and the Closing Date Amount as
delivered to Purchaser as set forth in Section 1.04.

Section 6.11. Member Representative. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Seller Cooperation Agreement,
each holder of Membership Interests hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Member Representative as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-
fact of such holder with full power and authority to act in such holder's name
and on such holder's behalf to do any and all things and execute any and all
documents that Member Representative determines may be necessary, convenient
or appropriate to perform the duties or exercise the rights granted to Member
Representative hereunder.

(b) Each holder of Membership Interests acknowledges that Member
Representative shall have the authority, for and on behalf of such holders,
subject to the Seller Cooperation Agreement, to take such actions and exercise
such discretion as are required to perform the duties or exercise the rights
granted to Member Representative hereunder or under the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and any such actions shall be
binding on each such holder and shall include the following: (i) to give and
accept communications and notices on behalf of such holder, (ii) to determine
each Seller's share of the Closing Date Amount pursuant to the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Seller Cooperation Agreement and
notify Purchaser thereof, (iii) after Closing, to receive payments on behalf
of such Seller due and owing pursuant to this Agreement and acknowledge
receipt thereof, (iv) after Closing, to distribute such payments among such
Sellers pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Seller Cooperation Agreement, (v) to execute the documents and certificates
required of Member Representative pursuant to this Agreement, (vi) to instruct
the Adjustment Escrow Agent and the Indemnity Escrow Agent to pay amounts due
Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.04(d) and Section 9.08,
respectively, (vii) to amend, supplement, change or waive any provision 

hereof, subject to compliance with Sections 8.03 and 8.04 and the Seller
Cooperation Agreement, (viii) after Closing, to (A) dispute or refrain from
disputing, on behalf of each Seller relative to any amounts to be received by
such Seller under this Agreement or any related document or instrument, any
claim made by Purchaser under this Agreement or any related document or
instrument, (B) negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such Seller, any
dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising any
remedies available under this Agreement or any related document or instrument,
and (C) execute, on behalf of such Seller, any settlement agreement, release
or other document with respect to such dispute or remedy relating to this
Agreement or the Seller Cooperation Agreement, (ix) to engage attorneys,
accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of Sellers in connection with any
claims under this Agreement or any related document or instrument; and (x)
after Closing, to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate in the
discretion of Member Representative, acting in good faith, to accomplish any
of the foregoing. In respect of the duties imposed on and rights granted to
Member Representative under or relating to this Agreement, Member
Representative shall, subject to the Seller Cooperation Agreement, act as
agent for each such holder and shall have authority to bind each such holder
in respect of such matters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and Purchaser may rely on
such appointment and authority.

(c) Member Representative may use the Member Representative Amount to pay any
fees, costs or expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of such Member
Representative's duties hereunder and, to the extent such fees, costs and
expenses, together with any amounts recovered from the Member Representative
Amount pursuant to Section 6.11(e), exceed the Member Representative Amount,
shall be entitled to reimbursement of such excess from the Sellers pursuant to
the terms of the Seller Cooperation Agreement.

(d) Subject to the Seller Cooperation Agreement, Member Representative shall
allocate any amount payable to Sellers under this Agreement in the manner
distributions would have been allocated among Sellers in their capacity as
members of the Company pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Company LLC Agreement.

(e) Member Representative shall not be liable for any act to the extent done
or omitted to be taken as Member Representative in its capacity as Member
Representative except as expressly set forth herein or in the Seller
Cooperation Agreement. Each Seller indemnifies and holds harmless Member
Representative and its partners, members, affiliates, managers, directors,
officers, fiduciaries, employees, agents and other Representatives (each, a
"Representative's Indemnified Person") from and against all losses,
liabilities, claims or expenses incurred or suffered by any Representative's
Indemnified Person as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to any and
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by Member Representative in its
capacity as Member Representative under this Agreement, the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Seller Cooperation Agreement
or in connection with 

the incurrence, payment, discharge or settlement of any of the obligations of
such Representative's Indemnified Persons, except to the extent any such
losses, liabilities, claims or expenses that arise on account of the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or material breach hereof in its capacity as
Member Representative or of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement or the Seller Cooperation Agreement by a Representative's
Indemnified Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final adjudication. Any losses, liabilities, claims or expenses for which any
Representative's Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 6.11(e), if not paid directly to such Representative's
Indemnified Person, may be recovered from the Member Representative Amount;
provided that, while this Section 6.11(e) allows the Member Representative to
be paid from the Membership Representative Amount, this Section 6.11(e) does
not relieve the Sellers from their obligation, to the extent not paid from the
Member Representative Amount, to promptly pay such losses, liabilities, claims
and expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Member
Representative from seeking any remedy available to it at law or otherwise;
provided, further, that to the extent such losses, liabilities, claims or
expenses, together with amounts used by the Member Representative pursuant to
Section 6.11(c), exceed the Member Representative Amount, the Member
Representative shall be entitled to seek such excess from the Sellers pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Seller Cooperation Agreement.

(f) No Representative's Indemnified Person shall be liable to any Seller in
respect of such arrangements or actions or omissions in connection therewith,
except to the extent that such acts or omissions constitute gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

(g) A decision, act, consent or instruction of Member Representative in
respect of a duty imposed on or right granted to Member Representative under
or relating to this Agreement shall constitute a decision for all holders of
Membership Interests in respect of such matter, and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each such holder, and Purchaser may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of such Member Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each such holder. Purchaser is
hereby relieved from any liability to any holder of Membership Interests for
any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of Member Representative.

(h) If LG ECSF L.P. becomes unable to serve as Member Representative, such
other person or persons may be designated by the holders of a majority of the
Membership Interests, and such person or persons shall succeed as Member
Representative.

Section 6.12. Section 280G Matters. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause KSH Solutions to take any actions necessary to
submit for the approval of the stockholders of KSH Solutions in a manner that
satisfies Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
final Treasury 

Regulations issued thereunder (the "Stockholder Vote"), the right of each
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) (each, a
"Disqualified Individual") to receive or retain, as applicable, that portion
of any payments and benefits that, together with any other payments and
benefits such Disqualified Individual may become entitled to receive that may
be considered "parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code
("Parachute Payments"), exceeds 299% of such Disqualified Individual's "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code). In connection with the
preceding sentence, (1) prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required individual waivers or
consents from each Disqualified Individual pursuant to which such Disqualified
Individual waives the right to any Parachute Payment, (2) following execution
of the waivers and consents described in clause (1), KSH Solutions shall
deliver, among other items, to its stockholders a disclosure statement
intended to satisfy the stockholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) prior to the Closing Date and (3) prior to the Stockholder Vote,
the Company shall have delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of all
disclosure and documents that comprise the stockholder approval of each
Parachute Payment in sufficient time to allow Purchaser to comment thereon but
no less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and shall reflect
all reasonable comments of Purchaser thereon.

Section 6.13. No-Shop. (a) Prior to the earlier of the Closing and
termination of this Agreement, none of the Sellers, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries shall, and shall instruct their respective Representatives not
to, and shall not permit any of their respective affiliates to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, assist or knowingly encourage a third party (other than
Purchaser and its affiliates) to acquire, directly or indirectly, all or
substantially all of any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i)
through any form of recapitalization transaction or any sale, merger,
consolidation, business combination, spin-off or liquidation, (ii) through a
purchase of assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii) through a
purchase of equity interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (iv)
through any other transaction designed to acquire a substantial portion of the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each,
an "Acquisition Proposal");

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations, or provide any
information to any person regarding any Acquisition Proposal by any person; or

(iii) agree to, approve, execute, enter into or become bound by any letter of
intent or other Contract or understanding between any of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, any of the Sellers or any of their respective affiliates
and any person that is related to or provides for any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Upon the execution of this Agreement and until the earlier of the Closing
and the termination of this Agreement, the Sellers, the Company and the 

Company Subsidiaries shall cease, and shall cause their respective
Representatives and Affiliates to cease, any discussions relating to an
Acquisition Proposal with any person other than Purchaser and its Affiliates.

(c) Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) sell, convey,
transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any of the Membership
Interests held by such Seller or any interest therein, except pursuant to this
Agreement; (ii) deposit any such Membership Interests into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any such
Membership Interests or grant any proxy with respect thereto; or (iii) enter
into any Contract with respect to the direct or indirect acquisition or sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition of any Membership Interests.

Section 6.14. Financing Activities.

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable and to consummate the Debt Financing at the Closing, on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Documents (including the
market flex provisions of the Debt Fee Letters) (subject to Purchaser's right
to amend, modify, supplement, restate or replace the Debt Commitment Documents
to the extent not prohibited hereby), including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing
at Closing that are applicable to Purchaser and reasonably within Purchaser's
control (other than any conditions waived by the applicable counterparties and
other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a result of
the Company's or a Seller's failure to furnish information or provide the
cooperation in breach of its obligations under this Section 6.14) and comply
in all material respects with its obligations in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including cooperating with any flex provisions requested by the Debt
Financing Sources), (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto (the "Definitive Financing Documentation") that reflect the terms
contained in the Debt Commitment Documents (including the market flex
provisions) or on such other terms acceptable to Purchaser and its financing
sources, provided that such other terms would not (A) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing, together with cash otherwise available to
Purchaser, to an amount below that necessary to satisfy Purchaser's obligation
to consummate the Transactions (as contemplated by Section 4.05), (B)
adversely impact or substantially delay the ability of Purchaser to timely
consummate the Transactions (as contemplated by Section 4.05 and taking into
account the Marketing Period) or (C) make the funding of the Debt Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less
likely to occur, including imposing new or additional conditions to the
funding at Closing or otherwise expanding or adversely amending or modifying
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing to be funded at
Closing and (iv) subject to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, and upon the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in 

Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of this Agreement, consummate the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Documents at or prior to Closing. If the
Debt Commitment Letter shall expire or terminate for any reason, Purchaser
shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain, and following receipt,
shall promptly provide the Company and the Member Representative with a copy
of, a debt commitment letter (with customary redactions) that provides for an
amount of debt financing sufficient to consummate the Transactions (as
contemplated by Section 4.05) and that contains conditions precedent to the
funding thereof at Closing that are not less favorable, to Purchaser (taking
into account any market flex provisions) than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Documents (an "Alternate Financing"). Purchaser shall not, without
the prior written consent of Member Representative (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend, modify, supplement,
restate or replace the Debt Commitment Letter in any manner that would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, together with cash
otherwise available to Purchaser, to an amount below that necessary to satisfy
Purchaser's obligation to consummate the Transactions (as contemplated by
Section 4.05), (ii) adversely impact or substantially delay the ability of
Purchaser to timely consummate the Transactions (as contemplated by Section
4.05 and taking into account the Marketing Period) or (iii) make the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur, including imposing new or additional
conditions to the funding at Closing or otherwise expanding or adversely
amending or modifying any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt
Financing to be funded at Closing; provided, that nothing in this sentence
will prohibit Purchaser from amending, modifying, supplementing, restating or
replacing the Debt Commitment Documents (x) to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the
Debt Commitment Documents (or a joinder or supplement) if the addition of such
parties, individually or in the aggregate, does not add new (or adversely
modify any existing) conditions to the funding of that portion of the Debt
Financing that is to be funded at Closing and would not otherwise reasonably
be expected to adversely impair or substantially delay the ability of
Purchaser to timely consummate the Transactions, or make the funding of that
portion of the Debt Financing that is to be funded at Closing materially less
likely to occur or (y) in connection with the exercise of the market flex
rights under the Debt Fee Letters. Upon any such amendment, modification,
supplement, restatement or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with this Section 6.14, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall
mean the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, modified, supplemented,
restated or replaced, "Debt Fee Letters" shall mean the Debt Fee Letters as so
amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced, "Debt Commitment
Documents" shall mean the Debt Commitment Documents as so amended, modified,
supplemented, restated or replaced, and "Definitive Financing Documentation"
shall mean the definitive agreements relating to such Debt Commitment Letter
as so amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced. Purchaser
acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the Transactions is not
conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the Debt Financing. 

(b) Purchaser shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing (or Alternate Financing obtained in accordance with this Section
6.14). Purchaser shall provide the Company with prompt written notice (i) if
to the Knowledge of Purchaser there exists any material breach, default,
repudiation, cancellation or termination or any waiver, amendment, restatement
or modification that is prohibited by this Section 6.14 (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to such breach, default, repudiation,
cancellation or termination or any waiver, amendment, restatement or
modification that is prohibited by this Section 6.14) by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter (or commitments for any Alternate Financing obtained in
accordance with this Section 6.14) or the Definitive Financing Documentation
or if any condition to the funding thereof at Closing is not likely to be
satisfied and (ii) if at any time for any reason Purchaser believes that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by and of
the Debt Commitment Letter (or commitments for any Alternate Financing
obtained in accordance with this Section 6.14) or the definitive agreements
relating to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date the Company delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser shall
provide any reasonably available information that is reasonably requested in
relation to any circumstances referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use each of
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers,
employees and advisors, including legal, financial and accounting advisors, to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with
arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing (which for purposes of this Section
includes any Alternative Financing), including using reasonable best efforts
in connection with (i) furnishing Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, the Required Information and providing
Purchaser and its Representatives with reasonable access to the
Representatives, employees, properties, books and records of the Company, (ii)
participating in, and to the extent reasonable and practical, making senior
management of the Company available to participate in, a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings between the parties acting
as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders, investors and
purchasers of, the Debt Financing and the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Company and other members of senior management and
Representatives of the Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection
with the Debt Financing, (iii) assisting Purchaser and the Debt Financing
Sources with the preparation of (A) offering documents, prospectus
supplements, private placement memoranda, registration statements,
confidential information memoranda and other marketing materials for any
portion of the Debt Financing (including assisting in the preparation of any
risk factors relating to all or any component thereof), (B) any pro forma
financial statements or adjustments (including regarding synergies, cost
savings, 

ownership or other post-Closing adjustments) or projections or other
information required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or
any Compensation, Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of
Regulation S-K and (C) materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda (including the delivery of one or more customary
representation and authorization letters) and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing (including the delivery of any consents of
accountants for use of their reports), (iv) cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources for all or any portion of
the Debt Financing, (v) executing and delivering any guarantees, pledge and
security documents and otherwise facilitating such guarantees and the pledging
of collateral, (vi) causing the Company's auditors and accountants to provide
assistance and cooperation to Purchaser, including participating in drafting
and accounting due diligence sessions and providing any comfort letters
reasonably deemed necessary by Purchaser for the marketing of the Debt
Financing, (vii) assisting in obtaining third party consents in connection
with the Debt Financing, (viii) obtaining, if applicable, in extinguishing
existing Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
releasing claims securing any such Indebtedness, customary payoff letters,
lien terminations and instruments of discharge, in each case, to take effect
at the Closing, (ix) helping the syndication efforts of the Debt Financing
Sources to benefit from existing bank relationships of the Company, (x)
causing the taking of corporate actions by the Company and each Company
Subsidiary (subject to the Closing) reasonably necessary for the consummation
of the Debt Financing and the Closing; provided, that no such action shall be
effective prior to the Closing, (xi) assisting Purchaser in connection with
Purchaser's filing with, or furnishing to, the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission in one or more Form 8-K filings, copies of the audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries required to be delivered pursuant to the defined term "Required
Information", including in obtaining from the auditors of the Company
customary authorizations for such filings and (xii) at least three (3)
Business Days before the Closing Date, providing all documentation and other
information about the Company and each Company Subsidiary as is reasonably
requested in writing by Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing and that relates to
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA Patriot Act; provided, however, that, (A)
irrespective of the above, no obligation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any certificate, document or instrument referenced in
subsection (v), (viii) or (x) above (other than the customary representation
and authorization letters referred to above and deliverable before Closing)
shall be effective until the Closing occurs and none of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any
certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing or
that would be effective before the Closing, and (B) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to bear any cost or expense or pay
any commitment fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent or to incur any
liability (other than a liability (1) that is contingent upon the Closing
occurring or (2) in respect of which Purchaser has agreed to provide
reimbursement, including, without limitation, pursuant to this Section 6.14,
with respect to the Debt Financing before the Closing). Purchaser shall, 

upon request by the Company, reimburse and indemnify the Company, its
subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees and advisors, including
legal, financial and accounting advisors and affiliates for reasonable out-of-

Section 8.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written consent of Principal Sellers and Purchaser;

(b) by either Principal Sellers or Purchaser, by written notice to the other:

(i) if the Closing has not occurred on or before May 31, 2018 (the "Outside
Date") so long as, on the Outside Date and the date of such notice, the
terminating party (or the Company, if Principal Sellers are the terminating
party) has not failed to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, which
failure has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to

party) is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement;

(c) by Purchaser by notice to Sellers, if Sellers or the Company breaches or
fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,

cannot be or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days after the

Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if Purchaser has materially
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(d) by Principal Sellers by notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser breaches or
fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Sections 7.01(b), 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) and (ii) cannot be or has not
been cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days after the giving of written

6.01, this Section 8.02 and Article X and the Confidentiality Agreement, all

on the part of any party and except to the extent that such termination
results from a knowing and intentional breach by a party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.
Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be deemed to release any party from any
liability for any damages for fraud or for any breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or 

to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by any other
party of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 8.03. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an

to Service of Process) and 10.14 (No Recourse Against Financing Sources) and
this Section 8.03 (Amendment) that relate to the Debt Financing Sources or any
other Debt Financing Source Party (and any other provision of this Agreement
to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would
modify the substance of such provisions) may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Debt
Financing Sources or any other Debt Financing Source Party without the prior

or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such
extension or waiver shall constitute an extension or waiver only with respect
to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair
the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any
other time. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

Section 9.01. Indemnification by Sellers. (a) From and after the Closing,
each Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, attorneys,
accountants, representatives, successors and permitted assigns ("Purchaser's
Indemnified Persons") from and against, and shall reimburse Purchaser and
Purchaser's Indemnified Persons for, any and all Losses incurred, suffered by
or asserted against Purchaser or the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, to the
extent directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from:

(i) any misrepresentation in or breach or inaccuracy of (A) such Seller's
Seller Fundamental Representations; (B) Company 

Fundamental Representations or (C) the other representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document;

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of such Seller set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document which by its terms contemplates performance after Closing;

(iii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of the Company set forth in Sections 5.01 or 6.10 of this
Agreement;

(iv) all Pre-Closing Taxes with respect to any Straddle Period (excluding all
Losses in respect of Taxes arising from transactions that occur (or are deemed
to occur) on the Closing Date after the Closing);

(v) any indirect rate adjustments, disallowed costs or withholdings made by
the relevant contracting officer based upon the findings and opinions issued
by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA") or another Government Entity
with respect to any costs incurred during pre-Closing performance under any
Government Contract; provided that Member Representative shall retain the
right to manage and defend any and all audits and other proceedings in respect
of such costs.

(b) The obligation to provide indemnification under Section 9.01(a), other
than with respect to Sections 9.01(a)(i)(A) and 9.01(a)(ii), shall be pro rata
in accordance with each Seller's share of the Purchase Price (such that the
total amount of such indemnity is equal to 100% of the applicable Losses). The
obligation to provide indemnification in the case of Sections 9.01(a)(i)(A)
and 9.01(a)(ii) shall be borne solely by the applicable Seller to whom such
representation or obligation, as applicable, relates. Each Seller's obligation
to provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.01(a) shall be several
and not joint.

Section 9.02. Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and its affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents,
attorneys, accountants, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
("Sellers' Indemnified Persons") from and against, and shall reimburse such
Sellers and such Sellers' Indemnified Persons for, any and all Losses
incurred, suffered by or asserted against the applicable Sellers or the
Sellers' Indemnified Persons, to the extent directly or indirectly arising out
of or resulting from:

(a) any misrepresentation in or breach or inaccuracy of (i) Purchaser
Fundamental Representations or (ii) the other representation or warranty of
Purchaser set forth in Article IV of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document; 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document;
or

(c) the amount set forth on Section 9.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
or any portion thereof, if and when it is finally determined that such amount
or portion thereof will not be paid.

Section 9.03. Defense of Third Party Claims. (a) If any legal proceedings
shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by any third party (other than in
a Tax Proceeding) (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of which any of
Purchaser, the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons or the Sellers or Sellers'
Indemnified Persons, as applicable, may have an obligation to indemnify
another party to this Agreement, the party asserting such right to indemnity
(the "Indemnified Party") shall give the party from whom indemnity is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") written notice thereof within 10 Business Days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim,
but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from
any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party reasonably promptly
after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party delivered
within 30 days of receipt of notice such Third Party Claim from the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the approval of the Indemnified Party, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Should the
Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense but the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such participation or otherwise in connection with the defense of such claim;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such legal
expenses if the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that the incurrence
of the same is appropriate in light of defenses not available to the
Indemnifying Party, conflicts of interest or other similar circumstances.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, all Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the Indemnifying Party's reasonable request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing
to defend against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that if the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
not agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which may not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement,
compromise or discharge (i) by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to
pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party
Claim, (ii) releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such
Third Party Claim, (iii) does not impose a consent order, injunction or decree
that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or
any of its affiliates, (iv) does not include a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its affiliates, (v) does not include a finding or admission
that would have an effect that is adverse in any material respect on claims
made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates and
(vi) does not impose any non-monetary condition or obligation on any
Indemnified Party, the Company or any of their respective affiliates.

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement, compromise
or discharge with respect to any Third Party Claim entered into without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned or delayed).

(f) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of such
claim as provided in this Section 9.03 or after assuming the defense of a
Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate at
the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (other than during any period
in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided above), and the Indemnifying Party will promptly
reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor in accordance with this Section 9.03.
The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses required by this Section 9.03
shall be made by periodic payments during the course of the investigations or
defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

Section 9.04. Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third Party Claim or a Tax Proceeding shall be asserted by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party in writing with reasonable
promptness, setting forth the facts giving rise to and the alleged basis for
such claim and, if known or reasonably ascertainable, the amount of the
liability asserted or which may be asserted by reason thereof, but any failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. In the event the
Indemnifying Party disputes its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
under this 

Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall have 45 days after receipt of notice
under this Section 9.04 to give written notice of such objection, and the
grounds therefor, and the Indemnified Party shall thereafter have 15 days to
respond in writing to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such
15-day period there remains a dispute as to any obligation, the parties shall
attempt in good faith for 15 days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to such indemnification obligation.

Section 9.05. Survival. (a) Subject to the limitations and other provisions
of this Agreement, the representations and warranties of Sellers and the
Company contained in this Agreement, other than the representations set forth
in Sections 2.01(a) (Organization), 2.02 (Authority; Execution and Delivery;

Structure), 3.04 (Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability) and 3.18
(Brokers) (such representations, the "Company Fundamental Representations")
and Section 3.09 (Taxes), shall survive the Closing for a period of 15 months
(the "General Survival Expiration Date") after which date they shall terminate
and be of no force and effect. Any claim for indemnity under Section
9.01(a)(i)(C) or 9.02(a)(ii) (except for any claim with respect to Taxes) must
be asserted in writing prior to the General Survival Expiration Date.

(b) Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, the
representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing until the General Survival Expiration Date after which
date they shall terminate and be of no force and effect, other than the
representations set forth in Sections 4.01(a) (Organization), 4.02 (Authority;
Execution and Delivery; Enforceability) and 4.04 (Brokers) (such
representations, the "Purchaser Fundamental Representations").

(c) Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, (i)
the respective covenants, agreements and other obligations of the Company, the
Sellers and Purchaser contained in this Agreement (other than any covenants,
agreements or other obligations of the Company or the Sellers contained in
Sections 5.01(a) and 6.10 of this Agreement) or in any Ancillary Document
required to be performed or complied with prior to or as of the Closing shall
not survive the Closing, after which they shall terminate and be of no force
and effect, (ii) the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
Company contained in Sections 5.01(a) and 6.10 of this Agreement shall survive
until the General Survival Expiration Date, after which they shall terminate
and be of no force and effect and (iii) the respective covenants, agreements
and other obligations of the Company, the Sellers and Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document required to be performed or
complied with following the Closing shall survive the Closing Date
indefinitely or for such lesser period of time as may be specified therein,
but not to exceed six (6) months following the applicable statute of
limitations in the event of a breach of such covenant or other agreement,
after which applicable date they shall terminate and be of no force and
effect. 

(d) Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, the
Seller Fundamental Representations, Company Fundamental Representations and
Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

(e) Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.09 shall survive the
Closing until six months following the applicable statute of limitations,
after which date they shall terminate and be of no force and effect.

(f) Any claim for indemnity under Section 9.01(a)(ii), 9.01(a)(iii), Section
9.02(b) or Section 9.02(c) must be asserted in writing before the applicable
date contemplated by Section 9.05(c). Any claim for indemnity under Section
9.01(a)(i)(C) with respect to Taxes or Section 9.01(a)(iv) must be asserted in
writing before six (6) months following the applicable statute of limitations.

(g) Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, a
party's rights to indemnification under this Article IX, and the other
provisions of this Article IX, shall not terminate with respect to any claim
for breach of a representation or warranty or covenant, agreement or other
obligation that survives the Closing pursuant to Sections 9.05(a) - (e) with
respect to which the Indemnified Party has delivered a written notice to the
Indemnifying Party prior to the applicable termination date in accordance with
Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.04, as applicable; provided, however, that the
applicable representation or warranty or covenant, agreement or other
obligation under this Article IX shall survive only until, and only for
purposes of, the resolution of the claim covered by such notice.

(h) Nothing in this Section 9.05 shall affect or limit the ability of
Purchaser to recover under the RandW Insurance for any matters covered
thereunder.

(i) It is the intention of the parties that the survival periods and
termination dates set forth in this Section 9.05 supersede any statute of
limitation that would otherwise be applicable to such representations,
warranties, covenants, agreements and other obligations or claims with respect
thereto.

Section 9.06. Indemnification Limitations; Cooperation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(a) In no event shall the aggregate liability of each Seller for all claims
of Losses under (i) Section 9.01(a)(i) or Section 9.01(a)(iv) exceed such
Seller's pro rata share (in accordance with each Seller's share of the
Purchase Price) of the Seller Overall Cap and (ii) Section 9.01(a)(i)(C)
(other than with respect to claims of any misrepresentation in or breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.09
(Taxes)) exceed such Seller's pro rata share (in accordance with each Seller's
share of the Purchase Price) of the Seller General Cap. In no event shall the
aggregate liability of Purchaser for all claims of Losses under (i) Section
9.02(a) exceed the Purchase Price or (ii) Section 9.02(a)(ii) exceed
$38,750,000. In no event shall the 

aggregate liability of each Seller for all claims of Losses under Section
9.01(a)(v) exceed such Seller's pro rata share (in accordance with each
Seller's share of the Purchase Price) of $780,000.

(b) Except with respect to claims of any misrepresentation in or breach or
inaccuracy of any Seller Fundamental Representation, Company Fundamental
Representation, Purchaser Fundamental Representation or Special Indemnity
Representation, none of Purchaser, the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, the
Sellers or the Sellers' Indemnified Persons, as applicable, shall be entitled
to recover any Losses pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i) or Section 9.02(a), as
applicable, (i) unless each such Loss (or series of related Losses arising
from the same set of facts or circumstances) exceeds $100,000 and (ii) until
the aggregate amount of Losses for which Purchaser or the Purchaser's
Indemnified Persons or the Sellers or the Sellers' Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, would be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX exceeds
the Seller Deductible in the case of Purchaser or a Purchaser's Indemnified
Person or $7,750,000 in the case of the Sellers or a Sellers' Indemnified
Person (as applicable to Purchaser or the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons or
to the Sellers or Sellers' Indemnified Persons, the "Deductible"), in which
case, Purchaser or the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons or the Sellers or the
Sellers' Indemnified Persons, as applicable, will be entitled to
indemnification hereunder only for such Losses that are in excess of the
applicable Deductible.

(c) Other than with respect to claims of any misrepresentation in or breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.09
(Taxes), neither Purchaser nor the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to recover any Losses with respect to any misrepresentation in or
breach or inaccuracy of any Special Indemnity Representation, until the
aggregate amount of Losses with respect to the Special Indemnity
Representations for which Purchaser or the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons
would be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX exceeds $100,000,
in which case, Purchaser or the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, will be entitled to indemnification hereunder only for such Losses
that are in excess of such amount.

(d) Each of Purchaser, Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, Sellers and Sellers'
Indemnified Persons shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses for which such persons are entitled or may be entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX, including by filing claims, and seeking
to recover available amounts, under applicable insurance policies (including
by filing claims under the RandW Insurance in respect of Pre-Closing Taxes for
which a claim could be made under either Section 9.01(a)(i)(C) or 9.01(a)(iv)
or indemnity provisions of applicable Contracts), and none of Purchaser,
Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, Sellers or Sellers' Indemnified Persons shall
be entitled to indemnification for any Losses to the extent that such Losses
arose from such person's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate such Losses; provided, that the amount of any actual costs or
expenses incurred in connection 

with such efforts to mitigate such Losses shall be included in the amount of
any such Losses.

(e) Prior to seeking recovery from Sellers, Purchaser agrees to make, or
cause the appropriate Purchaser's Indemnified Person to make, a claim for the
full amount of such Loss under the RandW Insurance; provided, however, that, so
long as Purchaser or the appropriate Purchaser's Indemnified Person has first
made such a claim under the RandW Insurance, as applicable, the Purchaser or
such Purchaser's Indemnified Person may also make a claim for indemnification
under Section 9.01(a)(i), notwithstanding the fact that Purchaser or such
Purchaser's Indemnified Person's claim under the RandW Insurance is still
pending; and provided, further, that subject to the limitations and other
provisions of this Agreement, with respect to any Losses indemnifiable under
Section 9.01(a)(i), (i) to the extent coverage is not available under such RandW
Insurance in respect of such Losses because the retention under the RandW
Insurance has not been reached or due to a Permitted RandW Insurance Exclusion,
Purchaser and Purchaser's Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover
such deficiency from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or (ii) if the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is not available for any reason, directly from the applicable Sellers,
provided, further, that no Seller shall be required to pay any Losses under
Section 9.01(a)(i) (beyond the recovery of Purchaser or Purchaser's
Indemnified Persons from the Indemnity Escrow Account) until the aggregate
amount of all unpaid Losses indemnifiable under Section 9.01(a)(i) exceeds the
then Available RWI Limit, in which event Sellers shall only be required to pay
for Losses in excess of the then Available RWI Limit (except that this
limitation shall not apply to any such Losses that are not recoverable under
the RandW Insurance (i) in respect of a Fundamental Loss or a Special Indemnity
Loss, to the extent the retention under the RandW Insurance has not been
satisfied or (ii) due to a Permitted RandW Insurance Exclusion). Purchaser
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to pursue, and agrees to cause the
appropriate Purchaser's Indemnified Person to pursue, such claims under the
RandW Insurance. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
for under this Article IX shall be (A) offset by any amounts recovered by such
indemnified persons as a result of any indemnification by any third party and
any insurance proceeds (including any amounts recovered by the indemnified
party under the RandW Insurance) or other amounts actually received by such
indemnified persons from third parties with respect to such Losses, net of any
actual costs, deductibles, expenses or premiums incurred in connection with
securing such amounts (including increased premiums resulting therefrom) other
than with respect to the RandW Insurance and (B) reduced for the net amount of
any Tax Benefits (as that term is defined in Section XII(EE) of the RandW
Insurance policy). In no event shall Purchaser or any Purchaser's Indemnified
Person be entitled to recover any duplicate Losses pursuant to this Article
IX; and if Purchaser or any Purchaser's Indemnified Person shall recover any
duplicate Losses pursuant to the RandW Insurance subsequent to recovering any
corresponding Losses from any Seller pursuant to this Article IX, Purchaser or
such Purchaser's Indemnified Person, as applicable, shall promptly reimburse
and deliver the amount of such duplicate recovery to such Seller. Purchaser
shall not, and, after the Closing, shall cause the Company not to, amend or
modify in any manner that may 

adversely affect Sellers, or cancel or otherwise consent to the termination
of, the RandW Insurance.

(f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 9.01 or 9.02 shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by a final determination (which shall include the execution
of a Form 870-AD or successor form).

(g) The amount of the Loss arising out of any item (including with respect to
any misrepresentation in or breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.21) to the extent included specifically as a
liability in calculating Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Change of Control Payments or Transaction Expenses shall be calculated
net of the amount so included, with the intent of this provision to merely be
to avoid "double counting" and not to limit any right to recover for Loss that
arises out of or results from any misrepresentation in or breach or inaccuracy
of any applicable representation or warranty in excess of the amount of such
Loss so included as a liability in calculating Closing Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Change of Control Payments or Transaction
Expenses. The amount of the Loss arising out of any reduction in value of any
Current Asset acquired at the Closing shall be calculated net of the reported
value of such Current Asset used in calculating Working Capital.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Purchaser nor any Purchaser's Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX for (i) any Losses (other than Losses
described in clause (ii) of this Section 9.06(g) to the extent such Losses are
specifically reflected in Closing Indebtedness or in Closing Working Capital
or (ii) any Losses in respect of Taxes due and payable by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to the extent the aggregate amount of such Losses are less
than or equal to the amount of Taxes reflected in Current Liabilities.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
Purchaser, the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons, any Sellers or any Sellers'
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX
with respect to any Losses that are in the nature of punitive damages (except
to the extent payable to third parties), regardless of the form of action
through which any of the foregoing are sought.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
indemnity pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i) with respect to the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.09 (Taxes) shall be limited to Losses in
respect of Pre-Closing Taxes, and (ii) such indemnity shall exclude all Losses
in respect of Taxes arising from transactions that occur (or are deemed to
occur) on the Closing Date after the Closing.

Section 9.07. Exclusive Remedy. (a) Except with respect to any claim to the
extent arising out of or based upon fraud and to the extent otherwise
expressly set forth in Section 1.04 and Section 6.06(c), from and after the
Closing, the rights expressly 

set forth in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties with respect to any Losses arising out of or relating to Purchaser's
investigation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, this Agreement, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and
liabilities, the Transactions, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
or any other certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against the others arising under or based upon the
Transactions, this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith, any applicable Law (including any rights of contribution
or recovery under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act or any analogous state law, or any other Environmental Law),
common law or otherwise except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article IX and except with respect to any claim to the extent
arising out of or based upon fraud and to the extent otherwise expressly set
forth in Section 1.04 and Section 6.06(c). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Ancillary Document, the
limitations on indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall not (i) apply
to any claim for Losses to the extent arising out of or based upon fraud or
(ii) apply to any claims under, or in any way limit Purchaser's or any
Purchaser's Indemnified Persons' rights in respect of, the RandW Insurance.

(b) The insurers under the RandW Insurance shall not have and will not pursue
any right of subrogation against Sellers, Member Representative or any
officer, director or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
following the Closing, except in the case of fraud, and the RandW Insurance
shall explicitly provide as such.

(c) After the Closing, no party may bring any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to rescind the Transactions or this Agreement, whether based on fraud,
gross negligence, negligence, breach of contract, breach of statute or
otherwise.

Section 9.08. Manner of Payment; Escrow.

(a) To the extent Purchaser or any Purchaser's Indemnified Person is entitled
to recover pursuant to this Article IX from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or from
any Seller, as applicable, a payment shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or such Seller, as
applicable, to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser,
within 15 days after the determination thereof.

(b) With respect to any indemnification in favor of any Sellers or any
Sellers' Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX, a payment shall be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Purchaser or
its affiliate, to an account or accounts designated in writing by such Seller
Indemnified Party, within 15 days after the determination thereof. 

(c) Any amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account as of the General
Survival Expiration Date (minus the aggregate amount reasonably claimed in
good faith by Purchaser or the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons pursuant to
claims made and not fully resolved prior to such date) shall be released by
the Indemnity Escrow Agent and disbursed to the Member Representative for the
benefit of the Sellers. Within five (5) Business Days after any such
disbursement to the Member Representative, to the extent the funds held in the
Indemnity Escrow Account exceed the aggregate amount reasonably claimed in
good faith by Purchaser or Purchaser's Indemnified Persons pursuant to claims
made prior to the General Survival Expiration Date, and not fully resolved
prior to the time of determination, the excess funds shall be promptly
released by the Indemnity Escrow Agent and such funds shall be disbursed by
the Member Representative to the Sellers, allocating such funds among the
Sellers in the manner distributions would have been allocated among Sellers in
their capacity as members of the Company pursuant to the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Company LLC Agreement.

(d) Member Representative and Purchaser shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Indemnity Escrow Agent instructing the Indemnity Escrow
Agent to make any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account expressly
provided herein.

Section 9.09. Materiality. For purposes of calculating the amount of any
Losses incurred in connection with any misrepresentation or breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of any party in Article II,
Article III or Article IV set forth herein (other than the Special Indemnity
Representations, as set forth in the following sentence, and Section 3.07(i))
(but not for purposes of determining the existence of any such
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy), any and all references to
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" (or other correlative or similar
terms) shall be disregarded and each representation or warranty made by any
party in Article II, Article III or Article IV, as applicable, shall be deemed
made without any such qualifications or limitations. Following the Closing,
for purposes of determining the existence of any misrepresentation or breach
or inaccuracy and for purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses
incurred in connection with any misrepresentation or breach or inaccuracy of
any Special Indemnity Representation, any and all references to "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" (or other correlative or similar term) shall be
disregarded and each Special Indemnity Representation shall be deemed made
without any such qualifications or limitations.

Section 10.03. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section, Annex or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article
or Section of, or an Annex or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The word "or" shall be construed to have the
same meaning and effect as the inclusive term "and/or". The word "extent" in
the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The words "hereof",
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. All references herein to "dollars", "U.S.
dollars" or "$" shall be deemed to be references to the lawful money of the
United States. All provisions herein qualified by the term "domestic" or
"foreign" shall be construed on the basis that the United States is the
relevant domestic country. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to 

all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

Section 10.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 10.05. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement may be delivered
by facsimile or electronic delivery (i.e., by e-mail of a PDF signature page),
and each such counterpart signature page shall constitute an original for all
purposes.

Section 10.06. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitutes the
entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the Transactions and (b)
except for Section 6.07, is not intended to confer upon any person other than
the parties and their respective successors and assigns any rights or
remedies; provided, however, that the Debt Financing Sources and each Debt
Financing Source Party shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and have
the right to enforce, the provisions of Sections 1.02 (Closing) (only with
regard to the proviso in the first sentence thereof), 6.14 (Financing
Activities), 8.03 (Amendment), 10.08 (Governing Law), 10.09 (Assignment),
10.10 (Enforcement, Jurisdiction, Consent to Service of Process), 10.14 (No
Recourse Against Financing Sources) and this Section 10.06 (Entire Agreement;
No Third-Party Beneficiaries) that are related to the Debt Financing Sources
or such Debt Financing Source Party, as the case may be.

Section 10.07. Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement (including in Sections 1.04(c), 6.02, 6.06(c), 6.07, 6.14 and
9.03 and with respect to Change of Control Payments), all fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses. The cost of the RandW
Insurance and any fees, costs or deductibles associated therewith shall be
borne solely by Sellers. The fees payable to a Governmental Entity in
connection with filings under applicable antitrust Laws shall be shared
equally by the Company and Purchaser, whether or not the Closing occurs.

Section 10.08. Governing Law. This Agreement, and all matters, claims or
causes of action (whether in contract or tort) based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof; provided,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, all disputes or controversies involving
the Debt Financing Sources or any other Debt Financing Source Party or arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, any Alternate Financing,
the Debt Commitment Documents, any commitment letter for any Alternate
Financing, the definitive documentation for the Debt Financing or, if
applicable, any Alternate Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of
the 

State of New York, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that
might be applied because of the conflicts-of-laws principles of the State of
New York.

Section 10.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign
any and all of its rights under this Agreement to (a) one or more of its
wholly owned Subsidiaries (but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of
any of its obligations hereunder) or (b) any Debt Financing Source, including,
without limitation, any agent or other representative thereof, as collateral
security for obligations thereto in respect of the Debt Financing or, if
applicable, any Alternate Financing, and any refinancings, extensions,
refundings or renewals thereof. Any purported assignment without a consent
required under the foregoing sentence shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 10.10. Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of
Delaware, without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, none of Sellers, the Company or
Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
10.10 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction, and the party opposing such
injunction or injunctions hereby agrees that it shall not contest the amount
or absence of any such bond or other security requested or offered by the
party seeking such injunction or injunctions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Sellers nor the Company (nor any of their respective
equityholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents or representatives) shall be entitled to specifically enforce any
rights of Purchaser to cause the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter
to be funded.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located in
the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of Delaware, (iv) waives
any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions, including, in connection with any
legal proceeding seeking enforcement of such party's rights under this
Agreement or directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Debt
Financing, any Alternate Financing, any Debt Commitment Document, any
commitment letter for any Alternate Financing, the definitive documentation
for the Debt Financing or 

any Alternate Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby (including
any such legal proceeding involving or against the Debt Financing Sources or
any Debt Financing Source Party), (v) waives the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action related to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions and (vi) consents to service of process being
made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 10.01. The consents to
jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents
to service of process in the State of Delaware. The parties hereto agree that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees
that it will not bring or support any Legal Proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources or any other Debt Financing
Source Party and their respective current, former or future directors,
officers, general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
controlling persons, affiliates, employees or representatives in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than any federal or state court located in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (and any appellate courts
thereof).

Section 10.11. Purchaser Acknowledgement. (a) Purchaser is knowledgeable
about the business engaged in by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
of the usual and customary practices of companies engaged in businesses
similar to such business. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
representations and warranties set forth in Articles II and III and contained
in any Ancillary Documents constitute the sole and exclusive representations
and warranties of Sellers and the Company to Purchaser in connection with the
Transactions, and there are no other representations, warranties, covenants,
understandings or agreements, oral or written, in relation thereto between the
parties other than those incorporated therein. Except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in Articles II and III and contained in any
Ancillary Documents, Purchaser disclaims reliance on any representations or
warranties, either express or implied, by or on behalf of Sellers, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or their affiliates or representatives.

(b) Purchaser represents that it is a sophisticated party. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that any financial forecasts or projections relating
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prepared by or on behalf of the
Company or Sellers have been provided to Purchaser with the understanding and
agreement that neither the Company nor Sellers are making any representation
or warranty with respect to such forecasts or projections and that actual
future results may vary from such forecasts or projections based upon numerous
factors.

Section 10.12. Affiliate Liability. Each of the following is herein referred
to as a "Company Affiliate": any director, officer or employee of (i) the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) any person who controls the Company
or any Company Subsidiary. Other than Sellers as specifically provided for
herein and other than in the event of fraud, no Company Affiliate shall have
any personal liability or personal obligation to Purchaser of any nature
whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement, and Purchaser hereby
waives and releases all claims of any such liability and obligation; provided,
however, that the foregoing waiver and release shall not apply to claims and
obligations for liability arising under the reimbursement obligations under
Section 6.07.

Section 10.13. Legal Counsel Conflicts Wavier. You are aware that Cravath,
Swaine and Moore LLP ("Cravath") and Venable LLP ("Venable") have acted as legal
counsel to the Company, the Sellers and its and their respective affiliates,
and may in the future act as legal counsel to 

the Company's affiliates, the Sellers or the Sellers' affiliates. You hereby
waive, on your own behalf and on behalf of your affiliates, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Cravath or Venable representing the Company and
its affiliates in connection with the Transactions. You agree that the fact
that Cravath and Venable have acted as legal counsel to you or any of your
affiliates shall not prevent Cravath or Venable from representing the Company,
the Sellers or any of its or their affiliates in connection with the
Transactions, including any disputes between any of the parties hereto. You
also further agree that, as to all communications between or among Cravath
and/or Venable, on the one hand, and the Company, the Sellers or its or their
affiliates or Representatives, on the other hand, that relate in any way to
the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers and
shall not pass to or be claimed by you or your affiliates, including after the
Closing. You represent that by executing this agreement you have given your
informed consent within the meaning of the New York Rules of Professional
Conduct to the representation of the Company, the Sellers and its and their
affiliates by Cravath and Venable.

Section 10.14. No Recourse Against Financing Sources. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, and without limiting the generality of
Sections 1.02 (Closing) (only with regard to the proviso in the first sentence
thereof), 4.05 (Capital Resources), 6.14 (Financing Activities), 8.03
(Amendment), 10.06 (Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries), 10.08
(Governing Law), 10.09 (Assignment) and 10.10 (Enforcement, Jurisdiction,
Consent to Service of Process), each of the Sellers, and the Company hereby
agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective affiliates,
directors, managers, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, investment bankers, advisors, financing sources, and agents and other
representatives and successors and assigns that none of (i) the Debt Financing
Sources, (ii) their respective former, current or future affiliates or (iii)
any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers, advisors, financing sources,
agents or other representatives (any persons referred to in clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii) above a "Debt Financing Source Party") shall have any liability or
obligation to any Seller or the Company or their respective affiliates,
directors, managers, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, investment bankers, advisors, financing sources, and agents and other
representatives and successors and assigns relating to this Agreement or any
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing, any
Alternate Financing, any Debt Commitment Document, any commitment letter for
any Alternate Financing or the definitive documentation for the Debt Financing
or any Alternate Financing and the performance thereof), whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and each such person agrees not to

litigation, arbitration, proceeding (including any civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or appellate proceeding), hearing, inquiry,
audit, examination or investigation commenced, brought, conducted or heard by
or before, or otherwise involving, any court or other Governmental Entity or
