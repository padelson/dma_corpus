indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The costs of such indemnification
(including the costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification) shall be paid only
from the Equityholders&#146; Representative Expense Fund, and the Equityholders shall have no further
liability therefor. Neither Parent, nor any of its Affiliates (including after the Effective Time,

all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Equityholders&#146; Representative in accordance with such
