Furthermore, the Parties acknowledge that circumstances may exist that (i) delay or prevent the achievement of the FDA Milestone or the Sales Milestone or (ii) limit, reduce or otherwise negatively impact the amount of Worldwide Gross Profit, Worldwide Ancillary Gross Profit or Worldwide Net Sales with respect to any Contingent Payment Product, if any, that any member of the Buyer Group may generate during any one or more Contingent Payment Years, thereby eliminating, or reducing the amount of, the Sales/Profit Contingent Payments for any such Contingent Payment Year.

Any Disputed Contingent Payment Amount determined by an Appraiser in accordance with this _Section 3.11(f)_ shall be deemed to be the final Sales/Profit Contingent Payment Amount for the applicable Contingent Payment Year for all purposes of this Agreement.

In the event that (A) Parent sets off the amount of any Contingent Payment by the amount of any Losses that have not been, at the time such Contingent Payment is made, incurred by Parent or (B) the Equityholders Representative objects to a Claim as set forth in  _Section 9.11_, and it is later finally determined that the full amount of such Losses will not be incurred by Parent, or the applicable Parent Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article 9_ with respect to any portion of such Losses, as the case may be, then, following such determination, Parent shall either, in its discretion and subject to the Maximum Sales/Profit Contingent Amount, (i) increase the next Contingent Payment to be made by Parent by the amount, without interest, of such prior reduction attributable to such Losses that will not be incurred by Parent (or for which the applicable Parent Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification), or (ii) pay to the Participating Rights Holders, promptly after such determination and without interest, the amount of the prior reduction attributable to such Losses that will not be incurred by Parent (or for which the applicable Parent Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification) in the form of an additional Contingent Payment that is otherwise paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 9.13_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have no right to set-off or reduce the amount of any Contingent Payment otherwise required to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.11 except as is expressly set forth in this Section 3.11(h). 

  

 (i) _No Security_. The Parties understand and agree that (a) the contingent rights to receive any Contingent Payment will not be represented by any form of certificate, are not transferable, except by operation of Laws relating to descent and distribution, divorce and community property, and do not constitute an equity or ownership interest in Parent or the Surviving Corporation, (b) no Equityholder shall have any rights as a security holder of the Surviving Corporation or Parent as a result of such Equityholders contingent right to receive any Contingent Payment hereunder and (c) no interest is payable with respect to any Contingent Payment.

the amount by which the aggregate proceeds received by Parent as a result of
the transaction set forth in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) above exceeds the
Parent Net Investment; _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances

Company, or (v) any other transaction, the consummation of which would
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Related Agreement or which would reasonably be
expected to diminish significantly the benefits to Parent or its Affiliates

obligation to, nor, without Parents prior written consent, shall the
Company, (A) make proposals, execute, agree or consent to or carry out
agreements or submit to Orders (1) providing for the sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent, any of
its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, and other Subsidiaries
of Parent or any of their Affiliates, or the Company or the holding separate
of any capital stock of any such Person, or imposing or seeking to impose any

seeking to impose (x) any limitation whatsoever on the business activities of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) or (y) any
limitation on the business activities of the Company which, in the judgment
of Parent in its sole discretion, might result in a limitation of the benefit
expected to be derived by Parent as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby or might adversely affect Parent or any of Parents Affiliates,
including its Subsidiaries and the Company, or (B) otherwise take any step to
avoid or eliminate any impediment which may be asserted or requested under any

any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Employees in the year of the Closing Date with respect to similar plans
maintained by the Company.

 (ii) This power of attorney and all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any Equityholder, by operation of Law, whether by such Equityholders death, disability, protective supervision or any other event.

 (iii) Each Equityholder hereby waives any and all defenses which may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Equityholders Representative taken in good faith under the Escrow Agreement or pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section 9.6_.

 (f) _Liability_. If the Equityholders Representative is required by the terms of the Escrow Agreement to determine the occurrence of any event or contingency, the Equityholders Representative shall, in making such determination, be liable to the Equityholders only for his or her proven fraud or willful misconduct as determined in light of all the circumstances, including the time and facilities available to him or her in the ordinary conduct of business. In determining the occurrence of any such event or contingency, the Equityholders Representative may request from any of the Equityholders such reasonable additional evidence as the Equityholders Representative in his or her sole discretion may deem necessary to determine any fact relating to the occurrence of such event or contingency, and may at any time inquire of and consult with others, including any of the Equityholders, and the Equityholders Representative shall not be liable to any Equityholder for any damages resulting from his or her delay in acting hereunder pending his or her receipt and examination of additional evidence requested by him or her.

After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, even if the Escrow Agent has not received written authorization from the Equityholders Representative, the Escrow Agent shall make payment in accordance with  _Section 9.7_; _provided_ that no such payment may be made if the Equityholders Representative shall object in a written statement to the Claim made in the Escrow Claim Notice and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. 

  

 Section 9.9 Resolution of Claims upon the Escrow Fund.

notice, an " _Equityholders  Representatives Defense Election_"), and in
the event of such an Equityholders Representatives Defense Election, the

Losses from such Claim. Within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such
notice, the Equityholders Representative shall provide a written notice to

provided within such period, the Equityholders Representative and the Parent
Indemnified Person or its, his or her representative(s) shall then attempt in
good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such Claims. If no such resolution can be

 Section 9.12 Other Matters. For purposes of this Agreement, a Claim that involves continuing behavior or a series of events, accidents or occurrences shall be deemed to "occur" on the first day of any alleged event, circumstance, or omission (" _EC andO_"), so long as (a) any subsequent alleged ECandO is in substance a continuation, or is an unambiguous result, of the first ECandO and (b) Parent shall not have become aware of such ECandO and the circumstances that may give rise to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto. Any other ECandO shall constitute a new ECandO. 

  

 Section 9.13 Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the existence of this _Article 9_ and of the rights and restrictions set forth herein do not limit any legal or other remedy against any Party hereto for Claims based on fraud or willful misconduct by such Party, or against Parent for any breach hereof. In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit any right or remedy that any Party may have against any other Party under the Related Agreement.

 (a) The Company shall prepare and file in a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Company that are due on or before the date of the Effective Time. The Company shall pay in a timely manner all Taxes that are due on or before the date of the Effective Time. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Company and shall utilize accounting methods, elections and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting the allocation of income or expense between the Tax periods covered by such Tax Returns and subsequent Tax periods.

 (a) After the date of the Effective Time, Parent shall promptly notify the Equityholders Representative in writing of any written notice of a proposed adjustment or claim in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving Parent or the Company which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under _Article 9_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not affect Parents right to

The Equityholders Representative shall keep Parent informed of the progress of any such audit or proceeding, and Parent also may participate in any such audit or proceeding at its expense. The Equityholders Representative shall not settle any proceeding without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if the settlement would adversely affect the Surviving Corporation. If the Equityholders Representative does not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, Parent may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate at its expense, including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding.
