the shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock subject to such Exchanged Options
and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_.

reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
Company Stock evidenced by certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") entitled to

acceptable to Spartan and the Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and
shall specify (A) that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the

Spartan shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section
3.01_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , each Certificate
entitled to receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.01_ shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.01_.

  



  

   

19

Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan
Class B Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class B Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate
in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or
other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, Spartan
shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the shares of Spartan Class A
Common Stock or Spartan Class B Common Stock issued in exchange therefore,
without interest, (i) promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business
Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class B Common Stock,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to

to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Stock.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(e)  _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Spartan Class A Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(f)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Spartan, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 3.02_
shall thereafter look only to Spartan for the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Company Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of Spartan free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g)  _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Spartan or the Surviving

Preferred Stock, Company Convertible Notes and the Company Convertible Equity
Security described in _Section 3.01(a)_ , _Section 3.01(b)_ and _Section

resulting from the conversion of Company Preferred Stock, Company
Convertible Notes and the Company Convertible Equity Security described in

such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment, issuance or transfer under the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to
the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid,
issued or transferred to the holder of the Company Stock (or intended
recipients of compensatory payments) in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

(i)  _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is otherwise
entitled to receive pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of
_Section 3.01_.

(j)  _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares representing
fractional shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class B Common
Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Company Common Stock or Company
Founders Stock and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Spartan or a holder
of shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class B Common Stock. In
lieu of any fractional share of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class
B Common Stock to which any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Founders
Stock would otherwise be entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down
to the nearest whole share of Spartan Class A Common Stock or Spartan Class B
Common Stock, as applicable, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash
settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by
rounding.

  



  

Section 3.03  _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates

Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Spartan for any
reason shall be converted into the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration

the extent available under the DGCL or, to the extent applicable, the CCC,
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Founders Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders of
the Company who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal
or dissenters' rights for such Company Common Stock and Company Founders
Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, or to the extent applicable,
Chapter 13 of the CCC, and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of
the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of appraisal rights or, to
the extent applicable, complied with all of the provisions of the CCC
relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights, shall not
be converted into, and such stockholders shall have no right to receive, the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration unless and until such stockholder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, or to the extent applicable, right to
dissenters' rights under the CCC. Any stockholder of the Company who fails
to perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Founders Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL, or to the extent applicable,
dissenters' rights pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC, shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, if
applicable, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02(b)_, of the Certificate
or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Founders Stock (as the case may be).

shall not, except with the prior written consent of Spartan (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

converted into the right to receive the number of shares of Spartan Class B
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded up or down to the nearest whole
number, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up) of (x) the number of shares of
Company Class A Common Stock that would have been issuable upon the
conversion of such share of Company Founders Stock at the then-

(ii) is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion letter from the IRS, and to
the knowledge of Company, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such

information made available to Spartan, its affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives by, or on behalf of, Company, and any such
representations or warranties are expressly disclaimed. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule) or in any
certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement,
neither Company nor any other person on behalf of Company has made or makes,
any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to
any projections, forecasts, estimates or budgets made available to Spartan,
its affiliates or any of their respective Representatives of future revenues,
future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any of the
foregoing), whether or not included in any management presentation or in any
other information made available to Spartan, its affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives or any other person, and any such representations
or warranties are expressly disclaimed.

  



  

Article V. _ 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SPARTAN AND MERGER SUB_

  



  

Except as set forth in the Spartan SEC Reports (to the extent the qualifying
nature of such disclosure is readily apparent from the content of
such Spartan SEC Reports, but excluding disclosures referred to in "Forward-
Looking Statements", "Risk Factors" and any other disclosures therein to the
extent they are of a predictive or cautionary nature or related to forward-
looking statements) (it being acknowledged that nothing disclosed in such a
Spartan SEC Report will be deemed to modify or qualify the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.01_ (Corporate
Organization), _Section 5.03_ (Capitalization) and _Section 5.04_  (Authority
Relative to This Agreement)), Spartan hereby represents and warrants to the
Company as follows:

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority and all
necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals would not be
a Spartan Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Merger Sub is the only subsidiary of Spartan. Except for Merger Sub,
Spartan does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest
in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or

and the Merger Sub Organizational Documents.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists of 10,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "). As of the date hereof, 10,000 shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock are issued and outstanding. All outstanding shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and are non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights, and are held
by Spartan free and clear of all Liens, other than transfer restrictions
under applicable securities laws and the Merger Sub Organizational Documents.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(c) All outstanding Spartan Units, shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock,
shares of Spartan Founders Stock and Spartan Warrants have been issued and
granted in compliance with all applicable securities laws and other applicable
Laws and were issued free and clear of all Liens other than transfer
restrictions under applicable securities laws and the Spartan Organizational
Documents.

  



  

(d) The Per Share Merger Consideration being delivered by Spartan hereunder
shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each such
share or other security shall be issued free and clear of preemptive rights
and all Liens, other than transfer restrictions under applicable securities
laws and the Spartan Organizational Documents. The Per Share Merger
Consideration will be issued in compliance with all applicable securities
Laws and other applicable Laws and without contravention of any other
person's rights therein or with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) Except for the Subscription Agreements, this Agreement, the Spartan
Warrants and the Spartan Founders Stock, Spartan has not issued any options,
warrants, preemptive rights, calls, convertible securities or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the
issued or unissued capital stock of Spartan or obligating Spartan to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, Spartan.
All shares of Spartan Class A Common Stock and Spartan Class B Common Stock
subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Neither
Spartan nor any subsidiary of Spartan is a party to, or otherwise bound by,
and neither Spartan nor any subsidiary of Spartan has granted, any equity
appreciation rights, participations, phantom equity or similar rights. Except
for the Letter Agreement, Spartan is not a party to any voting trusts, voting
agreements, proxies, shareholder agreements or other agreements with respect
to the voting or transfer of Spartan Common Stock or any of the equity
interests or other securities of Spartan or any of its subsidiaries. Except
with respect to the Redemption Rights and the Spartan Warrants, there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Spartan to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any shares of Spartan Common Stock. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Spartan to make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any person.

  



  

Section 5.04  _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Each of Spartan and
Merger Sub have all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Spartan and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Spartan and Merger Sub
of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Spartan
or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than (a) with respect to the Merger, the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding shares of Spartan Common Stock and by the holders of a majority
of the then outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock, and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (b)
with respect to the issuance of Spartan Class A Common Stock and Spartan
Class B Common Stock and the amendment and restatement of the Spartan
Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to this Agreement, the approval of a
majority of the then-outstanding shares of Spartan Common Stock). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Spartan and
Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Spartan or
Merger Sub, enforceable against Spartan or Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms subject to the Remedies Exceptions. The Spartan Board has approved this
Agreement and the Transactions, and such approvals are sufficient so that the
restrictions on business combinations set forth in the Spartan Certificate of
Incorporation shall not apply to the Merger, this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or any of the other Transactions. To the knowledge of Spartan, no
other state takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or the other
Transactions.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

Section 5.05  _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Spartan and
Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of Spartan
and Merger Sub will not, (i) conflict with or violate the Spartan
Organizational Documents or the Merger Sub Organizational Documents, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations, expiration or
termination of waiting periods and other actions described in _Section
5.05(b)_ have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in
_Section 5.05(b)_ have been made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable
to each of Spartan or Merger Sub or by which any of their property or assets
is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien on any property or asset of each of Spartan or Merger Sub pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which each of Spartan
or Merger Sub is a party or by which each of Spartan or Merger Sub or any of
their property or assets is bound or affected, except, with respect to
_clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not have or reasonably be
expected to have a Spartan Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Spartan and
Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of Spartan
and Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, or expiration or termination of
any waiting period by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws
and state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR
Act, and filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by
the DGCL and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Spartan or
Merger Sub from performing its material obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.06  _Compliance_. Neither Spartan nor Merger Sub is or has been in
conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable
to Spartan or Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of Spartan or
Merger Sub is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Spartan or Merger Sub is a party or by which Spartan or
Merger Sub or any property or asset of Spartan or Merger Sub is bound,
except, in each case, for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations
that would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Spartan Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Spartan and Merger Sub is in possession of all
material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Authority necessary for Spartan or Merger Sub to own, lease and
operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

Section 5.07  _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley_.

  



  

(a) Spartan has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since August 9, 2018,
together with any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto
(collectively, the " _Spartan SEC Reports_ "). Spartan has heretofore
furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments and
modifications that have not been filed by Spartan with the SEC to all
agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by
Spartan with the SEC and are currently in effect. As of their respective
dates, the Spartan SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
(ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of any Spartan SEC
Report that is a registration statement, or include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, in the case of any other Spartan SEC Report. Each
director and executive officer of Spartan has filed with the SEC on a timely
basis all documents required with respect to Spartan by Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

  



  

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the Spartan SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with
GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, as
applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of Spartan as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or
in the aggregate be material). Spartan has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that are not disclosed in the Spartan SEC Reports. No financial statements
other than those of Spartan are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of Spartan.

  



  

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the Spartan SEC Reports, neither
Spartan nor Merger Sub has any liability or obligation of a nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be reflected on a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities and
obligations arising in the ordinary course of Spartan's and Merger Sub's
business.

  



  

(d) Spartan is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(e) Spartan has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Spartan and other material information required to be disclosed by Spartan in
the reports and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Spartan's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Spartan's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Spartan's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(f)  Spartan maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting
that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that Spartan maintains records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all material
respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board
of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. Spartan has delivered to the
Company a true and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a
summary thereof) by any representative of Spartan to Spartan's independent
auditors relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls and any
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that
would adversely affect the ability of Spartan to record, process, summarize
and report financial data. Spartan has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-
blower allegations, whether or not material, that involve management or other
employees or consultants who have or had a significant role in the internal
control over financial reporting of Spartan. Since March 31, 2020, there have
been no material changes in Spartan's internal control over financial
reporting.

  



  

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by
Spartan to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) or director of Spartan, and Spartan has not taken any action prohibited
by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(h) Neither Spartan (including any employee thereof) nor Spartan's
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by Spartan, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Spartan's management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by Spartan
or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

  



  

(i) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC
with respect to the Spartan SEC Reports. To the knowledge of Spartan, none of
the Spartan SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof is subject to
ongoing SEC review or investigation as of the date hereof.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

Section 5.08  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2019
and prior to the date of this Agreement, except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, (a) Spartan has conducted its business in all material
respects in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past
practice, other than due to any actions taken due to a "shelter in
place," "non-essential employee" or similar direction of any Governmental
Authority, (b) Spartan has not sold, assigned, transferred, permitted to
lapse, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of any right, title, or interest in or
to any of its material assets, (c) there has not been a Spartan Material
Adverse Effect, and (d) Spartan has not taken any action that, if taken after
the date of this Agreement, would constitute a material breach of any of the
covenants set forth in _Section 6.02_.

  



  

Section 5.09  _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Spartan, threatened against Spartan, or any property or asset of
Spartan, before any Governmental Authority. Neither Spartan nor any material
property or asset of Spartan is subject to any continuing order of, consent
decree, settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to
the knowledge of Spartan, continuing investigation by, any Governmental
Authority.

  



  

Section 5.10  _Board Approval; Vote Required_.

  



  

(a) The Spartan Board, by resolutions duly adopted by majority vote of those
voting at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of Spartan and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and declared their
advisability, (iii) recommended that the stockholders of Spartan approve and
adopt this Agreement and the Merger, and directed that this Agreement and the
Merger, be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of Spartan at the
Spartan Stockholders' Meeting.

  



  

(b) The only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Spartan necessary to approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Spartan Common Stock.

  



  

(c) The Merger Sub Board, by resolutions duly adopted by written consent and
not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, has duly (i) determined
that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of
Merger Sub and its sole stockholder, (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Merger and declared their advisability, (iii) recommended that the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger and directed that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted for consideration by the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub.

  



  

(d) The only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

Section 5.11  _No Prior Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations or incurred any obligation or liability, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.12  _Brokers_. Except for Cowen and Company, LLC, Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC and Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of Spartan or Merger Sub. Spartan has provided the Company
with a true and complete copy of all contracts, agreements and arrangements
including its engagement letters, with Cowen and Company, LLC, Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC and Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, other than those that have
expired or terminated and as to which no further services are contemplated
thereunder to be provided in the future.

  



  

Section 5.13  _Spartan Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement, Spartan
has no less than $569,000,000 in the trust fund established by Spartan for
the benefit of its public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ") (including, if
applicable, an aggregate of approximately $19,320,000 of deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions being held in the Trust Fund) maintained in a trust
account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Trust Account_ "). The
monies of such Trust Account are invested in United States Government
securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in
trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Trustee_ ")
pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of August 9,
2018, between Spartan and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust
Agreement has not been amended or modified and is valid and in full force and
effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Remedies Exceptions. Spartan has complied in all material respects with the
terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default
thereunder and there does not exist any event which, with the giving of notice
or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by Spartan or
the Trustee. There are no separate contracts, agreements, side letters or
other agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied): (i) between Spartan and the Trustee that would cause the
description of the Trust Agreement in the Spartan SEC Reports to be inaccurate
in any material respect; or (ii) that would entitle any person (other than
stockholders of Spartan who shall have elected to redeem their shares of
Spartan Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Spartan Organizational
Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to
the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released
except: (A) to pay income and franchise Taxes from any interest income earned
in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of Redemption Rights in
accordance with the provisions of the Spartan Organizational Documents. To
Spartan's knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, following the
Effective Time, no stockholder of Spartan shall be entitled to receive any
amount from the Trust Account except to the extent such stockholder is
exercising its Redemption Rights. There are no Actions pending or, to the
knowledge of Spartan, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust
Account. Upon consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee
pursuant to the Trust Agreement, Spartan shall cause the Trustee to, and the
Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Spartan as promptly as
practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust Agreement at which
point the Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however that the
liabilities and obligations of Spartan due and owing or incurred at or prior
to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts
payable (a) to stockholders of Spartan who shall have exercised their
Redemption Rights, (b) with respect to filings, applications and/or other
actions taken pursuant to this Agreement required under Law, (c) to the
Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with the Trust Agreement,
and (d) to third parties (e.g., professionals, printers, etc.) who have
rendered services to Spartan in connection with its efforts to effect the
Merger. Spartan has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
use of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in
the Trust Account will not be available to Spartan at the Effective Time.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

Section 5.14  _Employees_. Other than any officers as described in the
Spartan SEC Reports, Spartan and Merger Sub have no employees on their
payroll, and have not retained any contractors, other than consultants and
advisors in the ordinary course of business. Other than reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Spartan's officers and directors in
connection with activities on Spartan's behalf in an aggregate amount not in
excess of the amount of cash held by Spartan outside of the Trust Account,
Spartan has no unsatisfied material liability with respect to any officer or
director. Spartan and Merger Sub have never and do not currently maintain,
sponsor, or contribute to any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

Section 5.15  _Taxes_.

they are required to file as of the date hereof and all such filed Tax Returns
are complete and accurate in all material respects; (ii) have timely paid all
Taxes that are shown as due on such filed Tax Returns and any other
material Taxes that they are otherwise obligated to pay, except with respect
to current Taxes that are not yet due and payable or otherwise being

no material penalties or charges are due with respect to the late filing of
any Tax Return required to be filed by or with respect to them; (iii) with
respect to all material Tax Returns filed by or with respect to them, have
not waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any

litigation or other proceeding in respect of a material amount of Taxes or
material Tax matters pending, asserted or proposed or threatened in writing,
for a Tax period which the statute of limitations for assessments remains
open; and (v) have provided adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP in the
most recent consolidated financial statements of Spartan for any material
Taxes of Spartan as of the date of such financial statements that have not
been paid.

  



  

(b) Neither Spartan nor Merger Sub is a party to, is bound by or has an
obligation under any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnification agreement,
Tax allocation agreement or similar contract or arrangement (including any
agreement, contract or arrangement providing for the sharing or ceding of
credits or losses) or has a potential liability or obligation to any person as
a result of or pursuant to any such agreement, contract, arrangement or
commitment, in each case, other than an agreement, contract, arrangement or
commitment the primary purpose of which does not relate to Taxes.

  



  

   

52

similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. income Tax law); (ii) "closing

entered into or created prior to the Closing, or (v) prepaid amount received
prior to the Closing outside the ordinary course of business.

  



  

(d) Each of Spartan and Merger Sub has withheld and paid to the appropriate
Tax authority all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any current or former employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party and has
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations relating to the reporting and withholding of Taxes.

  



  

(e) Neither Spartan nor Merger Sub has been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated, combined or unitary U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. income Tax Return (other than a group of which Spartan was the common
parent).

  



  

(f) Neither Spartan nor Merger Sub has any material liability for the Taxes
of any person (other than Spartan and Merger Sub) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise, in each case other
than an agreement, contract, arrangement or commitment the primary purpose of
which does not relate to Taxes.

  



  

(g) Neither Spartan nor Merger Sub has any request for a material ruling in

SEC; provided that Spartan may postpone or adjourn the Spartan Stockholders'
Meeting on one or more occasions for up to 30 days in the aggregate upon the

recommend to its stockholders that they approve the Spartan Proposals

solicit, initiate or continue any discussions or negotiations with, or
knowingly encourage or respond to any inquiries or proposals by, or
participate in any negotiations with, or provide any information to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person or other entity or "group"
within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, concerning any sale
of any material assets of such party or any of the outstanding capital stock
or any conversion, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving such party or any of such party's Subsidiaries other
than with the other parties to this Agreement and their respective
Representatives (an " _Alternative Transaction_ "), (ii) enter into any
agreement regarding, continue or otherwise knowingly participate in any
discussions regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or cooperate in any way that would otherwise reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Alternative Transaction or (iii) commence, continue or renew any
due diligence investigation regarding any Alternative Transaction; provided
that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not be deemed a violation of this _Section 7.05_. Each party
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Alternative Transaction. Each party also agrees that it
will promptly request each person (other than the parties hereto and their
respective Representatives) that has prior to the date hereof executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an
Alternative Transaction to return or destroy all Confidential Information
furnished to such person by or on behalf of it prior to the date hereof
(to the extent so permitted under, and in accordance with the terms of, such
confidentiality agreement). If a party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their respective Representatives receives any inquiry or proposal with
respect to an Alternative Transaction at any time prior to the Closing, then
such party shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after such party becomes aware of such inquiry or proposal) notify such
person in writing that such party is subject to an exclusivity agreement with
respect to the Transaction that prohibits such party from considering such
inquiry or proposal, but only, in the case of Spartan, to the extent not
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Spartan Board. Without limiting
the foregoing, the parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 7.05_ by a party or any of its Subsidiaries or its or
their respective affiliates or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach
of this _Section 7.05_ by such party.

Section 7.06  _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a) The parties shall cooperate to establish, prior to the filing of the
definitive Proxy Statement, an equity incentive award plan that will allow
the parties to effectuate the actions set forth in _Section 3.01(d)(vi)_ ,
which may include Spartan assuming the Company Stock Plan or establishing a
new equity incentive award plan. In the event that Spartan determines to
assume the Company Stock Plan, Spartan, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cooperate to take all actions necessary for the adoption to take place
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) The Company shall cause all notices to be timely provided to each
participant under the Company Stock Plan as required by the Company Stock
Plan.

  



  

(c) Spartan shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
subsidiary to provide the employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") credit for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and determining the level of benefits, as applicable, under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by
the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (excluding any retiree
health plans or programs, or defined benefit retirement plans or programs) for
service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided, however, that such crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit. In addition, subject to the terms of all governing documents,
Spartan shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under each of the
employee benefit plans established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries that cover the Continuing Employees or their
dependents, and (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, during the portion of the plan
year in which the Closing occurs, under those health and welfare benefit plans
in which such Continuing Employee currently participates to be taken into
account under those health and welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing
Employee participates subsequent to the Closing Date for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year. Following the Closing, Surviving Corporation will
honor all accrued but unused vacation and other paid time off of the
Continuing Employees that existed immediately prior to the Closing with
respect to the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(d) Prior to the filing of the definitive Proxy Statement, Spartan will adopt
a customary equity incentive plan that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

  



  

(e) Prior to the filing of the definitive Proxy Statement, the Company will
amend and restate the employment agreements with each of the Company's
current chief executive officer and current chief financial officer (the "
_Employment Agreements_ "), which Employment Agreements shall contain market
terms for a public company of similar size and industry to the Company.

  



  

(f)  The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to the Agreement, and nothing contained in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or legal representative or
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other person, any rights or remedies
of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement,
whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise, including, without
limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, or level of compensation or benefits. Nothing contained in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall constitute an amendment or modification
of any employee benefit plan of the Company or shall require the Company,
Spartan, the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries to continue
any Plan or other employee benefit arrangements, or prevent their amendment,
modification or termination.

  



  

Section 7.07  _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement or expense reimbursement than are set forth in the bylaws of the
Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by
applicable Law. Spartan further agrees that with respect to the provisions of
the bylaws or limited liability company agreements of the Company Subsidiaries
relating to indemnification, advancement or expense reimbursement, such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of
such Company Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required by
applicable Law. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Spartan
agrees that it shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
the bylaws of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify
such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law).

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Spartan shall maintain
in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_")
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy (true, correct and complete copies of
which have been heretofore made available to Spartan or its agents or
Representatives in the Virtual Data Room) on terms not less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall
Spartan be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of
300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance
policy for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
"). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium, then Spartan will be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with
respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance carrier so long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does
not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such
a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Spartan will maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years
after the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If
the Company is unable to obtain the "tail" policy and Spartan is unable to
obtain the insurance described in this _Section 7.07(b)_ for an amount less
than or equal to the Maximum Annual Premium, Spartan will instead obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Annual Premium.

  



  

(c) On the Closing Date, Spartan shall enter into customary indemnification
agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and Spartan with
the post-Closing directors and officers of Spartan, which indemnification
agreements shall continue to be effective following the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.08  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Spartan, and Spartan shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of any event which a party becomes aware of between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article IX_ ), the occurrence, or non-occurrence of which
causes or would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ to fail.

  



  

Section 7.09  _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, such things as
are necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise, and
each shall cooperate with the other, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including, without limitation, using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders of, and the expiration or termination of waiting
periods by, Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section 4.05_ necessary
for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the
Merger. In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of each party shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take all such action.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(b) Each of the parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other
parties of any communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permitting the other parties to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. No party
to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting, or video or
telephone conference, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting or conference. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other parties
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications, including
any documents, information and data contained therewith, between them or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby. No party shall take or cause to be taken any
action before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with or
intended to delay its action on requests for a consent or the consummation of
the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Spartan shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Private Placement in accordance
with the Subscription Agreements, and the Company shall cooperate with Spartan
in such efforts. Spartan shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or modification
to any Subscription Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause the
condition set forth in _Section 8.02(j)_ to fail.

  



  

Section 7.10  _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Spartan and the Company. Thereafter, between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ ) unless otherwise prohibited
by applicable Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, each of
Spartan and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements (including through social media platforms) with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement (including
through social media platforms) without the prior written consent of the
other party. Furthermore, nothing contained in this _Section 7.10_ shall
prevent Spartan or the Company and/or its respective affiliates from
furnishing customary or other reasonable information concerning the
Transactions to their investors and prospective investors that is
substantively consistent with public statements previously consented to by the
other party in accordance with this _Section 7.10_.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

Section 7.11  _Stock Exchange Listing_. Spartan will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Spartan Class A Common Stock issued in connection with
the Transactions to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange at
Closing. During the period from the date hereof until the Closing, Spartan
shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Spartan Units,
Spartan Class A Common Stock and Spartan Warrants listed for trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.

  



  

Section 7.12  _Antitrust_.

  



  

(a) To the extent required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade, including the HSR Act (" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each

Antitrust Laws, as applicable, and no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, the Company and Spartan each shall file (or cause
to be filed) with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission a Notification and Report From as
required by the HSR Act. The parties hereto agree to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to take all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods or obtain required approvals, as applicable
under Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, including by requesting early
termination of the waiting period provided for under the HSR Act.

  



  

(b) Spartan and the Company each shall, in connection with its efforts to
obtain all requisite approvals and expiration or termination of waiting
periods for the Transactions under any Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each other party or its
affiliates in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private person; (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private person, in each case regarding
any of the Transactions, and promptly furnish the other with copies of all
such written communications (with the exception of the filings, if any,
submitted under the HSR Act); (iii) permit the other to review in advance any
written communication to be given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or video or telephonic conference with, any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
person, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority or other person, give the other the opportunity
to attend and participate in such in person, video or telephonic meetings and
conferences; (iv) in the event a party is prohibited from participating in or
attending any in person, video or telephonic meetings or conferences, the
other shall keep such party promptly and reasonably apprised with respect
thereto; and (v) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the filing of
any memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending the Transactions, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to requests or
objections made by any Governmental Authority; _provided_  that materials
required to be provided pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_ may be restricted
to outside counsel and may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company, and (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(c) No party hereto shall take any action that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect or materially delay the approval of any Governmental
Authority, or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
Antitrust Laws, including by agreeing to merge with or acquire any other
person or acquire a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any
other person. The parties hereto further covenant and agree, with respect to
a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions,
to use reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 7.13  _Trust Account_. As of the Effective Time, the obligations of
Spartan to dissolve or liquidate within a specified time period as contained
in the Spartan Certificate of Incorporation will be terminated and Spartan
shall have no obligation whatsoever to dissolve and liquidate the assets of
Spartan by reason of the consummation of the Merger or otherwise, and no
stockholder of Spartan shall be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust
Account. At least 48 hours prior to the Effective Time, Spartan shall provide
notice to the Trustee in accordance with the Trust Agreement and shall deliver
any other documents, opinions or notices required to be delivered to the
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement and cause the Trustee prior to the
Effective Time to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, transfer

cash for immediate use on the balance sheet of Spartan, and to be used (a) to
pay the Company's and Spartan's unpaid transaction expenses in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions and (b) thereafter, for working
capital and other general corporate purposes of the business following the
Closing) and thereafter shall cause the Trust Account and the Trust Agreement
to terminate.

  



  

Section 7.14  _Tax Matters_. This Agreement is intended to constitute, and
the parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).
Each of Spartan, Merger Sub and the Company shall (a) use its respective
reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii) not
(and not permit or cause any of their affiliates, subsidiaries or
Representatives to) take any action which to its knowledge could reasonably be
expected to materially prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b)
report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, including attaching the statement
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a) on or with its Tax
Return for the taxable year of the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, except
as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, no party (or its respective
affiliates and owners) shall be required to satisfy its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ by foregoing, reducing, or adversely
modifying the amount, rights or nature of any shares, options or other
property such party (or its respective affiliates or owners) is entitled to
retain or receive pursuant to this Agreement (including indirectly by
agreeing to grant, increase, or modify the amount, rights or nature of any
shares, options or other property to which another party (or its respective
affiliates or owners) is entitled to retain or receive pursuant to this
agreement) without reasonable compensation therefor. To the extent the
parties reasonably determine the Transactions qualify as a tax-free
incorporation pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, either in addition to or
in lieu of the "reorganization" treatment discussed above, the parties agree
to undertake similar obligations as set forth in this Section 7.14 in respect
of such tax-free incorporation treatment.

  



  

   

69

that any such representation or warranty expressly is made as of an
earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such specified date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in more
than de minimis additional cost, expense or liability to the Company, Spartan,
Merger Sub or their affiliates and (iv) the other provisions of _Article V_
shall be true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any
"materiality," "Spartan Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers

an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such earlier date), except where the failures of any such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Spartan Material
Adverse Effect.

(b)  _Agreements and Covenants_. Spartan and Merger Sub shall have performed
or complied (i) in all respects with the covenant in _Section 7.16_, and

if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company, Spartan may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(f)_ for so long as the
Company continues to exercise its reasonable efforts to cure such breach,
unless such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice of such
breach is provided by Spartan to the Company; or

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a

Section 10.04   _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the

respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede, except as set forth in
_Section 7.04(b)_ , all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be
assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise) by
any party without the prior express written consent of the other parties
hereto.

and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other

reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 7.07_ (which is intended to
be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons).

  



  

Section 10.06   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All legal actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and

any such legal Action may be brought in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties hereto hereby
(a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
for themselves and with respect to their respective properties for the purpose
of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any
party hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any Action relating thereto
except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the

sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is

or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in
or by such courts.

  



  

Section 10.07  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event
of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

Section 10.08   _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.09   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in
one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 10.10   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and,
accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties'
obligation to consummate the Merger) in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, County of Newcastle, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction,
any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware without proof
of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any Law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Outside Date any party initiates an Action to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended by: (A) the amount of time during which such Action is pending plus
20 Business Days; or (B) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action.

  



  

Section 10.11  _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or
otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that
may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, execution, or performance or non-
performance of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents), may be
made only against (and such representations and warranties are those
solely of) the persons that are expressly identified as parties to this
Agreement or the applicable Transaction Document (the " _Contracting Parties_
") except as set forth in this _Section 10.11_. In no event shall any
Contracting Party have any shared or vicarious liability for the actions or
omissions of any other person. No person who is not a Contracting Party,
including without limitation any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, financing source, attorney or Representative or assignee of
any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate,
agent, financing source, attorney or Representative or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise,
or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any
other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or their negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, except with respect to willful misconduct or common law fraud against
the person who committed such willful misconduct or common law fraud, and, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law; and each party hereto waives
and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and obligations
against any such Nonparty Affiliates. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the Nonparty Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 10.11_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the
Contracting Parties or any Nonparty Affiliate shall be responsible or liable
for any multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or
punitive damages which may be alleged as a result of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, or the termination or
abandonment of any of the foregoing.

in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of the Company included in such Registration and to permit the
sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with
the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to
distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering under
this _subsection 2.2.1_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in

reached under the foregoing _clauses (i)_,  _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , Class A
Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other persons or
entities that the Company is obligated to include pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration or the launch of the Underwritten Offering with respect
to such Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons or
entities pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement or abandon an Underwritten Offering in connection with
a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the launch of such Underwritten

counted as an Underwritten Offering pursuant to an Underwritten Demand
effected under _Section 2.1_ hereof.

  



  

2.3 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (a) the Holders of Registrable
Securities have requested an Underwritten Offering pursuant to
an Underwritten Demand and the Company and the Holders are unable to obtain
the commitment of underwriters to firmly underwrite the offering; or (b) in
the good faith judgment of the Board a Registration or Underwritten Offering
would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board concludes as a
result that it is essential to defer the filing of the applicable Registration
Statement or the undertaking of such Underwritten Offering at such time, then
in each case the Company shall furnish to such Holders a certificate signed
by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the
Board it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for such Registration
Statement to be filed or to undertake such Underwritten Offering in the near
future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement or undertaking of such Underwritten Offering. In such
event, the Company shall have the right to defer such filing or offering for
a period of not more than thirty (30) days; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than once in
any 12-month period.

understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such notice),
or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of
the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or
continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration or
Underwritten Offering at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the

under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it
shall take such further action as any Holder of Registrable Securities may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such Holder to sell Registrable Securities held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal
opinions. Upon the request of any Holder of Registrable Securities, the
Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly
authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

jointly, indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and agents and
each person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities
Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any
untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement

written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to
the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party)
and (b) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim or there may be reasonable defenses available to the
indemnified party that are different from or addition to those available to
the indemnifying party, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense
of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such
money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such
settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

   

Ex A-13

 



    



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of
such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering
also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the Company's or
such Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to herein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party,
shall to the extent permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or payable
by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by a court of
law by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or relates
to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and
the indemnifying party's and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of any Holder under this
_subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds
received by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The
amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other
liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_, _4.1.2_  and _4.1.3_ above,
any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party
in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this _subsection
4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or
remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or
remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any

Re: Lock-Up Agreement1

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter (this " _Letter Agreement_ ") is being delivered to you in
accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the " _BCA_ ") entered into by and among Fisker Inc., a
Delaware corporation f/k/a Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. (the " _Company_
"), Spartan Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Fisker Group Inc., a
Delaware corporation f/k/a Fisker Inc. (" _Fisker_ "), pursuant to which,
among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Fisker on or about
the date hereof (the " _Merger_ "), with Fisker surviving the Merger as a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

  



  

In order to induce the Company to proceed with the Merger and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned (the " _Securityholder_ ") hereby agrees with
the Company as follows:

  



  

1\. Subject to the exceptions set forth herein, the Securityholder agrees not
to, without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the
Company, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate,
pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to
dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent
position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the
meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
" _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, any shares of Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Class A Common Stock_
") or any shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Company (" _Class B Common Stock_ " and together with Class A Common Stock,
collectively, " _Common Stock_ ") held by the Securityholder
immediately after the effective time of the Merger, including any shares of
Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of Class B
Common Stock, or any shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
options to purchase shares of Common Stock held by the Securityholder
immediately after the effective time of the Merger (" _Lock-Up Shares_ "),
(ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in
whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of
such Lock-Up Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery
of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any
intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) (the
actions specified in clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, " _Transfer_ ") for one
hundred eighty (180) days after the closing date of the Merger (the " _Lock-
Up_ "). [Thereafter, until the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the closing
date of the Merger, subject to the exceptions set forth herein, the
Securityholder agrees not to Transfer more than the lesser of (i) such number
of Lock-Up Shares resulting in gross proceeds to the Securityholder of
$25,000,000 and (ii) 10% of the Lock-Up Shares. Thereafter, until the two (2)
year anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, subject to the exceptions
set forth herein, the Securityholder agrees not to Transfer more than the
number of Lock-Up Shares that, together with any amounts Transferred pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, would constitute 80% of Lock-Up
Shares. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph that are applicable
after the Lock-Up are referred to herein collectively as the " _Extended
Lock-Up_."]2

member or affiliate of such entity; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| in the case of an individual, Transfers by gift to members of
the individual's immediate family (as defined below) or to a trust, the
beneficiary of which is a member of one of the individual's immediate
family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| in the case of an individual, Transfers by virtue of laws of
descent and distribution upon death of the individual;

   | (iv)| in the case of an individual, Transfers pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| in the case of an entity, Transfers by virtue of the laws of the
state of the entity's organization and the entity's organizational documents
upon dissolution of the entity; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| the exercise of any options to purchase Common Stock (which
exercises may be effected on a cashless basis to the extent the instruments
representing such options or warrants permit exercises on a cashless basis); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vii)| Transfers to the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations
pursuant to the Company's equity incentive plans or arrangements; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (viii)| Transfers to the Company pursuant to any contractual
arrangement in effect at the effective time of the Merger that provides for
the repurchase by the Company or forfeiture of the Securityholder's Common
Stock or options to purchase shares of Common Stock in connection with the
termination of the Securityholder's service to the Company; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ix)| the entry, by the Securityholder, at any time after the
effective time of the Merger, of any trading plan providing for the sale of
Common Stock by the Securityholder, which trading plan meets the requirements
of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , _however_ , that such
plan does not provide for, or permit, the sale of any Common Stock during the
Lock-Up [or the Extended Lock-Up that would be in violation of paragraph 1 of
this Letter Agreement] 3 and no public announcement or filing is voluntarily
made or required regarding such plan during the Lock-Up;

Ex B-2

 



    



   | (x)| a bona fide pledge of Common Stock to a financial institution;
_provided, however,_ that no public announcement or filing is voluntarily
made or required regarding such pledge during the Lock-Up and the financial
institution, upon any foreclosure, must enter into a written agreement, in
substantially the form of this Letter Agreement, agreeing to be bound by
these Transfer restrictions; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (xi)| transactions in the event of completion of a liquidation,
merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of
the Company's securityholders having the right to exchange their shares of
Common Stock for cash, securities or other property; 
---|---|--- 
  

 _ _

  

 _provided, however_ , that in the case of clauses (i) through (v), these
permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement, in substantially
the form of this Letter Agreement (it being understood that any references to
"immediate family" in the agreement executed by such transferee shall
expressly refer only to the immediate family of the Securityholder and not to
the immediate family of the transferee), agreeing to be bound by these
Transfer restrictions. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediate family"
shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild or other lineal
descendant (including by adoption), father, mother, brother or sister of
the undersigned; and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 405
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

  



  

3\. This Letter Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding
of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the
parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the
subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Letter
Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to
correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a
written instrument executed by all parties hereto.

  



  

4\. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other party. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph
shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any
interest or title to the purported assignee. This Letter Agreement shall be
binding on the Securityholder and each of its respective successors, heirs
and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

5\. This Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the
substantive laws of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto (i) all agree
that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in
any way to, this Letter Agreement shall be brought and enforced in any
Delaware Chancery Court, and irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction
and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive and (ii) waive any
objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts
represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

6\. This Letter Agreement shall terminate on the expiration of the Lock-Up
[and the Extended Lock-Up] 4.

effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by

 _ARTICLE VIII_ - _INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS_

  



  

Section 1\. _Right to Indemnification_.

  



  

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "),
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of
the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to
an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of
such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director,
officer, or trustee, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability, and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE VIII with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

  



  

Section 2\. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this
ARTICLE VIII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "
_advancement of expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the DGCL
requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "), by or on
behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that such
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this
Section 2 or otherwise.

  



  

Section 3\. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_.

  



  

If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this ARTICLE VIII is not paid in full by
the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by
the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of
expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the
indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought
by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon
a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard
for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who
are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit
brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving
that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement
of expenses, under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



  

   

Ex D-11

 



    



  

Section 4\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_.

  



  

The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in
this ARTICLE VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders, or
disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 5\. _Insurance_.

  



  

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and
any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise
against any expense, liability, or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability, or
loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 6\. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_.

  



  

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any
employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions
of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 7\. _Nature of Rights_.

  



  

The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this ARTICLE VIII shall be contract
rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to
be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration
or repeal of this ARTICLE VIII that adversely affects any right of an
indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit,
eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.

  



  

 _ARTICLE IX_ - _AMENDMENTS_

  



  

These Bylaws may be amended or repealed by the Board at any meeting or by the
stockholders at any meeting.

thereon, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, and no vote of the holders of the Class A Common Stock or

Section 2. Preferred Stock

  



  

2.1 The Corporation's Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") is authorized,
subject to any limitations prescribed by the law of the State of Delaware, by
resolution or resolutions adopted from time to time, to provide for the
issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, and, by filing a
certificate of designation pursuant to the applicable law of the State of
Delaware (the " _Certificate of Designation_ "), to establish from time to
time the number of shares to be included in each such series, to fix the
designation, vesting, powers (including voting powers), preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other rights (and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof) of the shares of each such series and
to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the
class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such series then
outstanding) the number of shares of any such series. The number of authorized
shares of Preferred Stock may also be increased or decreased (but not below
the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, without a
separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock or any series thereof,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the General
Corporation Law, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the
terms of any Certificate of Designation designating a series of Preferred
Stock.

  



  

2.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in any Certificate of Designation
designating any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Article IV, (i) any new series of Preferred
Stock may be designated, fixed and determined as provided herein by the Board
without approval of the holders of Common Stock or the holders of Preferred
Stock, or any series thereof, and (ii) any such new series may have powers,
preferences and rights, including, without limitation, voting rights, dividend
rights, liquidation rights, redemption rights and conversion rights, senior
to, junior to or _pari passu_ with the rights of the Common Stock, the
Preferred Stock or any future class or series of Preferred Stock or Common
Stock.

  



  

Section 3. Rights of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock

  



  

3.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or required by applicable law, shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have the same rights and powers, rank
equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation), share ratably and
be identical in all respects and as to all matters.

  



  

   

Ex E-2

 



    



  

3.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or as provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock shall (a) at all times vote together as a
single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted
to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation, (b) be entitled to notice of
any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation
(the " _Bylaws_ ") and (c) be entitled to vote upon such matters and in such
manner as may be provided by applicable law; provided, however, that, except
as otherwise required by law, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to
this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of
Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to
the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a
class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon
pursuant to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Certificate of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock). Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein or required by applicable law, each
holder of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to one (1) vote per share
of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder and each holder of Class
B Common Stock shall have the right to ten (10) votes per share of Class B
Common Stock held of record by such holder.

  



  

3.3 Shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be treated
equally, identically and ratably, on a per share basis, with respect to any
dividends or distributions as may be declared and paid from time to time by
the Board out of any assets of the Corporation legally available therefor;
provided, however, that in the event a dividend is paid in the form of shares
of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (or rights to acquire such
shares), then holders of Class A Common Stock shall receive shares of Class A
Common Stock (or rights to acquire such shares, as the case may be) and
holders of Class B Common Stock shall receive shares of Class B Common Stock
(or rights to acquire such shares, as the case may be), with holders of shares
of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock receiving, on a per share
basis, an identical number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may pay
or make a disparate dividend or distribution per share of Class A Common
Stock or Class B Common Stock (whether in the amount of such dividend or
distribution payable per share, the form in which such dividend or
distribution is payable, the timing of the payment, or otherwise) if such
disparate dividend or distribution is approved in advance by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then-
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as a class.

  



  

3.4 Shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock may not be
subdivided, combined or reclassified unless the shares of the other class are
concurrently therewith proportionately subdivided, combined or reclassified in
a manner that maintains the same proportionate equity ownership between the
holders of the outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on
the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification;
provided, however, that shares of one such class may be subdivided, combined
or reclassified in a different or disproportionate manner if such
subdivision, combination or reclassification is approved in advance by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the
then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting separately as a class.

  



  

   

Ex E-3

 



    



  

3.5 Subject to any preferential or other rights of any holders of Preferred
Stock then outstanding, upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock will be entitled to receive ratably all assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders unless
disparate or different treatment of the shares of each such class with
respect to distributions upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up
is approved in advance by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common
Stock and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of all the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each voting
separately as a class.

  



  

3.6 In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of
Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock upon the merger or consolidation
of the Corporation with or into any other entity, or in the case of any other
transaction having an effect on stockholders substantially similar to that
resulting from a merger or consolidation, such distribution or payment shall
be made ratably on a per share basis among the holders of the Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock as a single class; provided, however, that
shares of one such class may receive different or disproportionate
distributions or payments in connection with such merger, consolidation or
other transaction if (i) the only difference in the per share distribution to
the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is that any
securities distributed to the holder of a share Class B Common Stock have
ten (10) times the voting power of any securities distributed to the holder
of a share of Class A Common Stock, or (ii) such merger, consolidation or
other transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of Class A
Common Stock and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each
voting separately as a class.

  



  

Article V

  



  

Section 1. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall be convertible into one
(1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock at the option
of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Corporation.
Before any holder of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to convert any of
such holder's shares of such Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock, such holder shall deliver an instruction, duly signed and
authenticated in accordance with any procedures set forth in the Bylaws or any
policies of the Corporation then in effect, at the principal corporate office
of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Class B Common Stock,
and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate
office of such holder's election to convert the same and shall state therein
the name or names in which the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on
conversion thereof are to be registered on the books of the Corporation. The
Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, register on the
Corporation's books ownership of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
to which such record holder of Class B Common Stock, or to which the nominee
or nominees of such record holder, shall be entitled as aforesaid. Such
conversion shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the close of
business on the date such notice of the election to convert is received by the
Corporation, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of
Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Class A Common
Stock as of such date.

  



  

   

Ex E-4

 



    



  

Section 2. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without
further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof, be converted into one
(1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock immediately
prior to the close of business on the earliest of (i) the later of (a) ten
(10) years from the Effectiveness Date (as defined below) and (b) the date
that is one (1) year after the Separation Date (as defined below) of the last
to Separate (as defined below) of the Founders (as defined below); and (ii)
the date that is one (1) year after the death or Permanent Disability (as
defined below) of the last to die or become Disabled (as defined below)
of the Founders; and (iii) the date specified by the affirmative vote of the
holders of Class B Common Stock representing not less than two-thirds (2/3)
of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, voting
separately as a single class (each of the events referred to in (i), (ii) and
(iii) are referred to herein as an " _Automatic Conversion_ "). The
Corporation shall provide notice of the Automatic Conversion of shares of
Class B Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2 of Article V to record
holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock as soon as practicable
following the Automatic Conversion. Such notice shall be provided by any
means then permitted by the General Corporation Law; provided, however, that
no failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the
validity of the Automatic Conversion. Upon and after the Automatic
Conversion, the person registered on the Corporation's books as the record
holder of the shares of Class B Common Stock so converted immediately prior
to the Automatic Conversion shall be registered on the Corporation's books as
the record holder of the shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon Automatic
Conversion of such shares of Class B Common Stock, without further action on
the part of the record holder thereof. Immediately upon the effectiveness of
the Automatic Conversion, the rights of the holders of shares of Class B
Common Stock as such shall cease, and the holders shall be treated for all
purposes as having become the record holder or holders of such shares of
Class A Common Stock into which such shares of Class B Common Stock were
converted.

  



  

Section 3. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without
further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof, be converted into one
(1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock, upon the
occurrence of a Transfer (as defined below), other than a Permitted
Transfer (as defined below), of such share of Class B Common Stock.

  



  

Section 4. Each share of Class B Common Stock held of record by a natural
person, or by such person's Permitted Transferees, shall automatically,
without any further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof, convert
into one share of Class A Common Stock upon the death or Permanent
Disability of such holder; provided, however, that upon the death or
Permanent Disability of the first to die or become Disabled of the
Founders, subject to the other provisions of Section 2 of this Article V, the
shares of Class B Common Stock held by such Founder prior to his or her death
or Permanent Disability shall not convert into shares of Class A Common Stock
unless the other Founder or a Permitted Trust, Permitted IRA, Permitted
Entity or Permitted Foundation of such other Founder does not have (whether by
operation of law or pursuant to transfer agreements to be provided by the
Corporation) voting and dispositive power with respect to such shares from
and after such death or Permanent Disability; provided, further, that upon the
death or Permanent Disability of the last to die or become Disabled of the
Founders, the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such Founder shall
automatically, without any further action by the Corporation or the holder
thereof, convert into one share of Class A Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2 of this Article V.

  



  

   

Ex E-5

 



    



  

Section 5. The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such policies
and procedures, not in violation of applicable law or this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, relating to the administration of
the conversion of shares of the Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock as it may deem necessary or advisable. If the Corporation has
reason to believe that a Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer has
occurred, the Corporation may request that the purported transferor furnish
affidavits or other evidence to the Corporation as it reasonably deems
necessary to determine whether a Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer has
occurred, and if such transferor does not within ten (10) days after the date
of such request furnish sufficient (as determined in good faith by the Board)
evidence to the Corporation (in the manner provided in the request) to enable
the Corporation to determine that no such Transfer has occurred, any such
shares of Class B Common Stock, to the extent not previously converted, shall
be automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock and such
conversion shall thereupon be registered on the books and records of the
Corporation. In connection with any action of stockholders taken at a
meeting, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be presumptive evidence as
to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of stockholders and the classes of shares held by each such
stockholder and the number of shares of each class held by such stockholder.

outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. If at any time the number of
authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be sufficient
to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock, the Corporation shall promptly take such corporate action as may be
necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common
Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose,
including, without limitation, obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of
any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. All
shares of Class A Common Stock which are so issuable shall, when issued, be
duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares. The
Corporation shall take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all
such shares of Class A Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any
applicable law or regulation.

  



  

Article VI

  



  

Section 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or
under the direction of the Board, except as otherwise provided by law. In
addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute
or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, the
directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such
acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

  



  

Section 2. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the total
number of directors constituting the Whole Board shall be fixed from time to
time exclusively by resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For
purposes of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the term " _Whole
Board_ " shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not
there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.

  



  

   

Ex E-10

 



    



  

Section 3. Subject to the special rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors, the directors shall be divided, with
respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes
designated as Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively (the "
_Classified Board_ "). The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to such classes of the Classified Board, which assignments
shall become effective at the same time the Classified Board becomes
effective. Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance with a
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board, with the number of directors
in each class to be divided as nearly equal as reasonably possible. The
initial term of office of the Class I directors shall expire at the
Corporation's first annual meeting of stockholders following the
Effectiveness Date, the initial term of office of the Class II directors
shall expire at the Corporation's second annual meeting of stockholders
following the Effectiveness Date and the initial term of office of the Class
III directors shall expire at the Corporation's third annual meeting of
stockholders following the Effectiveness Date. At each annual meeting of
stockholders following the Effectiveness Date, directors elected to succeed
those directors of the class whose terms then expire shall be elected for a
term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders after their election. In the event of any increase or decrease
in the authorized number of directors (a) each director then serving as such
shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which the director
is a member and (b) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting
from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the
three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than
one director more than any other class.

  



  

Section 4. Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which
such director's term expires and until such director's successor is elected
and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation,
disqualification or removal. Any director may resign at any time upon notice
to the Corporation given in writing or by any electronic transmission
permitted by the Bylaws. Subject to the special rights of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock, no director may be removed from the Board except
for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-
thirds (2/3) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors voting together as a single class. In the event of any increase or
decrease in the authorized number of directors, (a) each director then
serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of
which the director is a member and (b) the newly created or eliminated
directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned
by the Board among the classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class
has more than one director more than any other class. To the extent possible,
consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be
added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest
dates following such allocation, and any newly eliminated directorships shall
be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the
earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided from time
to time by resolution adopted by the Board. No decrease in the authorized
number of directors constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any
incumbent director.

  



  

   

Ex E-11

 



    



  

Section 5. Subject to the special rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors, any vacancy occurring in the Board for any
cause, and any newly created directorship resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors, shall, unless (a) the Board determines by
resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be
filled by the stockholders or (b) as otherwise provided by law, be filled
only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office,
even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the
stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
at which the term of office of the class to which the director has been
assigned expires or until such director's successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation,
disqualification or removal. No decrease in the authorized number of directors
shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

  



  

Section 6. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
Bylaws shall so provide.

  



  

Article VII

  



  

Section 1. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no director of the
Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Without
limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, if the General Corporation Law
is hereafter amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of
the liability of a director, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the General Corporation Law, as so amended.

  



  

Section 2. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII, nor the
adoption of any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation
inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise
adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of
such an inconsistent provision.

  



  

Article VIII

  



  

The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws. Any
adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the Board shall require the
approval of a majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have
power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision
of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in addition to
any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation
required by applicable law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(including any Preferred Stock issued pursuant to any Certificate of
Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3)
of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt,
amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws; provided, further, that if two-
thirds (2/3) of the Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or
repeal of any provisions of the Bylaws, then only the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws.

  



  

   

Ex E-12

 



    



  

Article IX

  



  

Section 1. Subject to the rights of any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders
of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any
consent in writing by such stockholders.

  



  

Section 2. Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called
only by the Chairperson of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board
acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board, and
may not be called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be
considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been stated in
the notice for such meeting.

  



  

Section 3. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of
directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner and to the
extent provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

Article X

  



  

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all
such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court
for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the
following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common
law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the
Corporation; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other
employee of the Corporation or any stockholder to the Corporation or the
Corporation's stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim
against the Corporation or any current or former director, officer or other
employee of the Corporation or any stockholder in such stockholder's capacity
as such arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation
Law, this Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as each may
be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret,
apply, enforce or determine the validity of this Restated Certificate or the
Bylaws of the Corporation (including any right, obligation or remedy
thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation
Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;
and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director,
officer or other employee of the Corporation or any stockholder, governed by
the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by
law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the
indispensable parties named as defendants. This Article X shall not apply to
suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the
federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

  



  

   

Ex E-13

 



    



  

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of
the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution
of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended.

  



  

Any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in
any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have
consented to the provisions of this Article X.

  



  

Article XI

  



  

If any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall nonetheless
be enforced to the maximum extent possible consistent with such holding and
the remaining provisions of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including without limitation, all portions of any section of
this Restated Certificate of Incorporation containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

Article XII

  



  

Section 1. The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any
provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the
manner prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware and all rights
conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to this reservation; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or
any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but
in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of
the Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation), and subject to
Sections 1 and 2.1 of Article IV, the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be
required to amend or repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with Sections
1.2 and 2 of Article IV, or Article V, Article VI, Article VI, Article VIII,
Article IX, Article X, Article XI, or Section 1 of this Article XII (the "
_Specified Provisions_ "); provided, further, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the
Whole Board has approved such amendment or repeal of, or any provision
inconsistent with, the Specified Provisions, then only the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required to amend or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent
with, the Specified Provisions.

  



  

Section 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) or any provision
of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition
to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of the
Corporation required by law or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(including any Certificate of Designation), the affirmative vote of the
holders of Class A Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent
(75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class A Common
Stock, voting separately as a single class, and the affirmative vote of the
holders of Class B Common Stock representing at least seventy-five percent
(75%) of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock, each voting separately as single classes, shall be required to amend
or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, Section 3 of Article
IV or this Section 2 of Article XII.

The undersigned constitute the holders of shares of capital stock of Fisker
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), having, in the
aggregate, not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to authorize or take action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
on such action were present and voted, waive notice, and consent under
Sections 228, 242, and 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), the Bylaws of the Company (as amended to date, the
" _Bylaws_ "), and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company (as amended to date, the " _Charter_ "), to the adoption of the
following resolutions and agree that such resolutions will have the same
effect as if duly adopted at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company duly
called and held for the purpose. Capitalized terms used in this Written
Consent (as defined below) but not defined have the meanings set forth in the
BCA (as defined below).

  



  

 _Approval of the Transactions and the Transaction Documents_

  



  

WHEREAS, Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
_Spartan_ "), proposes to acquire the Company by means of a business
combination transaction in which (i) Spartan Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Spartan (" _Merger Sub_
"), will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
surviving the Merger as a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Spartan.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) determined that it is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for
the Company to execute, deliver, enter into, and otherwise become a party to
the Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of
July __, 2020 by and among Spartan, Merger Sub, and the Company
(substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ , the " _BCA_ ") and the
other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party, (iii) approved
the Merger and the other Transactions, and (iv) recommended that the Company's
stockholders approve the Merger and adopt the BCA and the other Transaction
Documents.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE BE IT:

  



  

RESOLVED, that the Merger, the other Transactions, the BCA, and the other
Transaction Documents, are adopted, approved, and ratified in all respects, in
each case subject to such changes and modifications as the proper officers of
the Company may consider necessary or appropriate.

  



  

   

Ex G-1

 



    



  

RESOLVED, that the undersigned Company stockholders acknowledge and agree
that the Per Share Merger Consideration under ARTICLE III of the BCA complies
with the Charter and all other organizational documents and any other
stockholder agreements of the Company, and accordingly, that the undersigned
Company stockholders are not entitled to any consideration under the Merger
except as set forth in ARTICLE III of the BCA.

  



  

RESOLVED, each of the undersigned Company stockholders had the opportunity to
ask representatives of the Company questions with regard to all the
resolutions, agreements, consents, and other provisions in this Written
Consent in Lieu of Special Meeting of Stockholders (" _Written Consent_
"), that all such questions have been answered fully and to the satisfaction
of such stockholder, and that such stockholder has had a reasonable time and
opportunity to consult with such stockholder's financial, legal, tax, and
other advisors, if desired, before signing this Written Consent.

  



  

RESOLVED, that each of the undersigned Company stockholders received and
reviewed and understand the terms of the BCA, the other Transactions Documents
to which such Company stockholder is a party, and all schedules and exhibits
to the BCA and such other Transaction Documents.

  



  

 _Waiver of Appraisal and Dissenters ' Rights_

  



  

WHEREAS, any Company stockholder who neither votes in favor of nor consents
to the Merger may, under certain circumstances by following procedures under
Section 262 of the DGCL (a copy of which is attached as _Exhibit B-1_ ) and
Chapter 13 of the CCC (a copy of which is attached as _Exhibit
B-2_), exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights under the DGCL or CCC, as
applicable, to receive cash in an amount equal to the "fair value" of such
stockholder's shares of the Company's capital stock to which such stockholder
has exercised such appraisal or dissenters' rights.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT:

  



  

RESOLVED, that each undersigned Company stockholder, only with respect to
such stockholder, (i) acknowledges and agrees that such stockholder (a)
received and read a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of the
CCC, and (b) is aware of such stockholder's ability to seek appraisal and
dissenters' rights and request an appraisal of the fair market value of shares
of the Company's capital stock held by such stockholder under Section 262 of
the DGCL and Chapter 13 of the CCC, (ii) that by signing this Written
Consent, such stockholder adopts the BCA and the other Transaction Documents
and approves the Merger, and as a result, (iii) irrevocably waives any
appraisal or dissenters' rights for such shares under the DGCL, the CCC,
and/or other applicable laws with respect to the BCA, the Transactions, and
the Transaction Documents.

RESOLVED, that the undersigned Company stockholders irrevocably waive
delivery of any notices with respect to the Transactions to which such

RESOLVED, that effective immediately prior to and contingent upon the
Effective Time, the Company Stockholder Agreements, and all rights and
obligations contained in such agreements, will be terminated in all respects,
the survival of any provisions therein will be waived in all respects, and
such agreements will cease to have force and effect upon termination.

  



  

 _General_

  



  

RESOLVED, that, notwithstanding the foregoing resolutions, the Company Board
may, at any time prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, abandon the Merger and the other

State without further action by the Company stockholders.

  



  

RESOLVED, that the officers of the Company be, and each of them acting is,
authorized and empowered to take any and all such further action, to execute
and deliver any and all such additional agreements, instruments, documents,
filings, and certificates, and to pay such expenses, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or such officer, as any such officer may deem
necessary or advisable to effectuate the purposes and intent of the foregoing
resolutions, the taking of such actions, the execution and delivery of such
agreements, instruments, documents, filings, and certificates, and the
payment of such expenses by any such officer, to be conclusive evidence of
such officer's authorization under the foregoing resolutions and approval
thereof.

  



  

RESOLVED, that any and all actions taken by the directors or officers of the
Company to carry out the purposes and intent of the foregoing resolutions
prior to their adoption are approved, ratified, and confirmed in all

§ 262 Appraisal rights.

  



  

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock
on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has
otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in
writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by
the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock
under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of
stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what
is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in
1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

  



  

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g)
of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of
this title:

  



  

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this
title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository
receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act
upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger
pursuant to § 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the
agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities
exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock
of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock
of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms
of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

  



  

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

  



  

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect
thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or
consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held
of record by more than 2,000 holders;

  



  

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

  



  

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in
lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

  



  

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party
to a merger effected under § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available
for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

  



  

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of
incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights
shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the
procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word
"amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or
"surviving or resulting corporation."

  



  

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate
of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.

  



  

   

Ex B1-2

 



    



  

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

  



  

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if
1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114
of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder's shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the
corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such
notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the
corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A
proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a
demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate
written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall
notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with
this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
effective; or

  



  

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h),
§ 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before
the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or
resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who
are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of
such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this
title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective
date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal
rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the
later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title
and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the
surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares;
provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic
transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any)
expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal
of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such
constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date
of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to
appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii)
the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all
such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided,
however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the
sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to
§ 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of
the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who
is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the
secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given.

  



  

   

Ex B1-3

 



    



  

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing
a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request
given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information
processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the
notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation
surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger
or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h)
of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock
(as defined in § 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and
were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer
referred to in § 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder
within 10 days after such stockholder's request for such a statement is
received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding
subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of
shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf
of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request
from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

  



  

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy
thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the
addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such
publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof
shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

  



  

   

Ex B1-4

 



    



  

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as
to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the
shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities
exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such
shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares
of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number
of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to §
253 or § 267 of this title.

  



  

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all
relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise
for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the
judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date
of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled
to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter
as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between
the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any
stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court
may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the
final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or
resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has
submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in
Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until
it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal
rights under this section.

  



  

   

Ex B1-5

 



    



  

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and
the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender
to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of
this State or of any state.

  



  

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon
the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the
appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's
fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

  



  

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock
(except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at
a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal
of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger
or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of
such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that
this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

  



  

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares
of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to
the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

CHAPTER 13. Dissenters' Rights [1300 - 1313]

  



  

 _1300._

  



  

(a) If the approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of a corporation
is required for a reorganization under subdivisions (a) and (b) or subdivision
(e) or (f) of Section 1201, each shareholder of the corporation entitled to
vote on the transaction and each shareholder of a subsidiary corporation in a
short-form merger may, by complying with this chapter, require the corporation
in which the shareholder holds shares to purchase for cash at their fair
market value the shares owned by the shareholder which are dissenting shares
as defined in subdivision (b). The fair market value shall be determined as
of the day of, and immediately prior to, the first announcement of the terms
of the proposed reorganization or short-form merger, excluding any
appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the proposed reorganization or
short-form merger, as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, or
share dividend that becomes effective thereafter.

  



  

(b) As used in this chapter, "dissenting shares" means shares to which all of
the following apply:

  



  

(1) That were not, immediately prior to the reorganization or short-form
merger, listed on any national securities exchange certified by the
Commissioner of Business Oversight under subdivision (o) of Section 25100,
and the notice of meeting of shareholders to act upon the reorganization
summarizes this section and Sections 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304; provided,
however, that this provision does not apply to any shares with respect to
which there exists any restriction on transfer imposed by the corporation or
by any law or regulation; and provided, further, that this provision does not
apply to any shares where the holder of those shares is required, by the terms
of the reorganization or short-form merger, to accept for the shares anything
except: (A) shares of any other corporation, which shares, at the time the
reorganization or short-form merger is effective, are listed on any national
securities exchange certified by the Commissioner of Business Oversight under
subdivision (o) of Section 25100; (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares
described in the foregoing subparagraph (A); or (C) any combination of the
shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares described in the foregoing
subparagraphs (A) and (B).

  



  

(2) That were outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to vote on the reorganization and (A) were not voted in favor of the
reorganization or, (B) if described in paragraph (1), were voted against the
reorganization, or were held of record on the effective date of a short-form
merger; provided, however, that subparagraph (A) rather than subparagraph (B)
of this paragraph applies in any case where the approval required by Section
1201 is sought by written consent rather than at a meeting.

  



  

(3) That the dissenting shareholder has demanded that the corporation
purchase at their fair market value, in accordance with Section 1301.

  



  

(4) That the dissenting shareholder has submitted for endorsement, in
accordance with Section 1302.

  



  

(c) As used in this chapter, "dissenting shareholder" means the recordholder
of dissenting shares and includes a transferee of record.

(a) If, in the case of a reorganization, any shareholders of a corporation
have a right under Section 1300, subject to compliance with paragraphs (3) and
(4) of subdivision (b) thereof, to require the corporation to purchase their
shares for cash, that corporation shall mail to each of those shareholders a
notice of the approval of the reorganization by its outstanding shares
(Section 152) within 10 days after the date of that approval, accompanied by
a copy of Sections 1300, 1302, 1303, and 1304 and this section, a statement of
the price determined by the corporation to represent the fair market value of
the dissenting shares, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed
if the shareholder desires to exercise the shareholder's right under those
sections. The statement of price constitutes an offer by the corporation to
purchase at the price stated any dissenting shares as defined in subdivision
(b) of Section 1300, unless they lose their status as dissenting shares under
Section 1309.

  



  

(b) Any shareholder who has a right to require the corporation to purchase
the shareholder's shares for cash under Section 1300, subject to
compliance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, and who
desires the corporation to purchase shares shall make written demand upon the
corporation for the purchase of those shares and payment to the shareholder in
cash of their fair market value. The demand is not effective for any purpose
unless it is received by the corporation or any transfer agent thereof (1) in
the case of shares described in subdivision (b) of Section 1300, not later
than the date of the shareholders' meeting to vote upon the
reorganization, or (2) in any other case, within 30 days after the date on
which the notice of the approval by the outstanding shares pursuant to
subdivision (a) or the notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was
mailed to the shareholder.

  



  

(c) The demand shall state the number and class of the shares held of record
by the shareholder which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase
and shall contain a statement of what the shareholder claims to be the fair
market value of those shares as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of
Section 1300. The statement of fair market value constitutes an offer by the
shareholder to sell the shares at that price.

 _1302._

  



  

Within 30 days after the date on which notice of the approval by the
outstanding shares or the notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110
was mailed to the shareholder, the shareholder shall submit to the
corporation at its principal office or at the office of any transfer agent
thereof, (a) if the shares are certificated securities, the shareholder's
certificates representing any shares which the shareholder demands that the
corporation purchase, to be stamped or endorsed with a statement that the
shares are dissenting shares or to be exchanged for certificates of
appropriate denomination so stamped or endorsed or (b) if the shares are
uncertificated securities, written notice of the number of shares which the
shareholder demands that the corporation purchase. Upon subsequent transfers
of the dissenting shares on the books of the corporation, the new
certificates, initial transaction statement, and other written statements
issued therefor shall bear a like statement, together with the name of the
original dissenting holder of the shares.

  

 _(Amended by Stats. 2012, Ch. 473, Sec. 3. (AB 1680) Effective January 1,

 _1303._

  



  

(a) If the corporation and the shareholder agree that the shares are
dissenting shares and agree upon the price of the shares, the dissenting
shareholder is entitled to the agreed price with interest thereon at the
legal rate on judgments from the date of the agreement. Any agreements
fixing the fair market value of any dissenting shares as between the
corporation and the holders thereof shall be filed with the secretary of the
corporation.

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, payment of the fair market
value of dissenting shares shall be made within 30 days after the amount
thereof has been agreed or within 30 days after any statutory or contractual
conditions to the reorganization are satisfied, whichever is later, and in
the case of certificated securities, subject to surrender of the certificates
therefor, unless provided otherwise by agreement.

  

 _(Amended by Stats. 1986, Ch. 766, Sec. 24.)_

  



  

 _1304._

  



  

(a) If the corporation denies that the shares are dissenting shares, or the
corporation and the shareholder fail to agree upon the fair market value of
the shares, then the shareholder demanding purchase of such shares as
dissenting shares or any interested corporation, within six months after the
date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152)
or notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the
shareholder, but not thereafter, may file a complaint in the superior court of
the proper county praying the court to determine whether the shares are
dissenting shares or the fair market value of the dissenting shares or both or
may intervene in any action pending on such a complaint.

  



  

(b) Two or more dissenting shareholders may join as plaintiffs or be joined
as defendants in any such action and two or more such actions may be
consolidated.

  



  

(c) On the trial of the action, the court shall determine the issues. If the
status of the shares as dissenting shares is in issue, the court shall first
determine that issue. If the fair market value of the dissenting shares is in
issue, the court shall determine, or shall appoint one or more impartial
appraisers to determine, the fair market value of the shares.

 _1305._

  



  

(a) If the court appoints an appraiser or appraisers, they shall proceed
forthwith to determine the fair market value per share. Within the time fixed
by the court, the appraisers, or a majority of them, shall make and file a
report in the office of the clerk of the court. Thereupon, on the motion of
any party, the report shall be submitted to the court and considered on such
evidence as the court considers relevant. If the court finds the report
reasonable, the court may confirm it.

  



  

(b) If a majority of the appraisers appointed fail to make and file a report
within 10 days from the date of their appointment or within such further time
as may be allowed by the court or the report is not confirmed by the court,
the court shall determine the fair market value of the dissenting shares.

  



  

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, judgment shall be rendered
against the corporation for payment of an amount equal to the fair market
value of each dissenting share multiplied by the number of dissenting shares
which any dissenting shareholder who is a party, or who has intervened, is
entitled to require the corporation to purchase, with interest thereon at the
legal rate from the date on which judgment was entered.

  



  

(d) Any such judgment shall be payable forthwith with respect to
uncertificated securities and, with respect to certificated securities, only
upon the endorsement and delivery to the corporation of the certificates for
the shares described in the judgment. Any party may appeal from the judgment.

  



  

(e) The costs of the action, including reasonable compensation to the
appraisers to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or apportioned as the
court considers equitable, but, if the appraisal exceeds the price offered by
the corporation, the corporation shall pay the costs (including in the
discretion of the court attorneys' fees, fees of expert witnesses and
interest at the legal rate on judgments from the date of compliance with
Sections 1300, 1301 and 1302 if the value awarded by the court for the shares
is more than 125 percent of the price offered by the corporation under
subdivision (a) of Section 1301).

To the extent that the provisions of Chapter 5 prevent the payment to any
holders of dissenting shares of their fair market value, they shall become
creditors of the corporation for the amount thereof together with interest at
the legal rate on judgments until the date of payment, but subordinate to all
other creditors in any liquidation proceeding, such debt to be payable when
permissible under the provisions of Chapter 5.

Cash dividends declared and paid by the corporation upon the dissenting

shares (Section 152) and prior to payment for the shares by the corporation
shall be credited against the total amount to be paid by the
corporation therefor.

corporation consents thereto.

Dissenting shares lose their status as dissenting shares and the holders
thereof cease to be dissenting shareholders and cease to be entitled to
require the corporation to purchase their shares upon the happening of any of
the following:

  



  

(a) The corporation abandons the reorganization. Upon abandonment of the
reorganization, the corporation shall pay on demand to any dissenting
shareholder who has initiated proceedings in good faith under this chapter
all necessary expenses incurred in such proceedings and reasonable
attorneys' fees.

  



  

(b) The shares are transferred prior to their submission for endorsement in
accordance with Section 1302 or are surrendered for conversion into shares of
another class in accordance with the articles.

  



  

(c) The dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree upon the
status of the shares as dissenting shares or upon the purchase price of the
shares, and neither files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action as
provided in Section 1304, within six months after the date on which notice of

This chapter, except Section 1312, does not apply to classes of shares whose
terms and provisions specifically set forth the amount to be paid in respect
to such shares in the event of a reorganization or merger.

  

 _(Amended by Stats. 1988, Ch. 919, Sec. 8.)_

 _1312._

  



  

(a) No shareholder of a corporation who has a right under this chapter to
demand payment of cash for the shares held by the shareholder shall have any
right at law or in equity to attack the validity of the reorganization or
short-form merger, or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set
aside or rescinded, except in an action to test whether the number of shares
required to authorize or approve the reorganization have been legally voted
in favor thereof; but any holder of shares of a class whose terms and
provisions specifically set forth the amount to be paid in respect to them in
the event of a reorganization or short-form merger is entitled to payment in
accordance with those terms and provisions or, if the principal terms of the
reorganization are approved pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1202, is
entitled to payment in accordance with the terms and provisions of the
approved reorganization.

  



  

(b) If one of the parties to a reorganization or short-form merger is
directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control with, another
party to the reorganization or short-form merger, subdivision (a) shall not
apply to any shareholder of such party who has not demanded payment of cash
for such shareholder's shares pursuant to this chapter; but if the shareholder
institutes any action to attack the validity of the reorganization or short-
form merger or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set aside or
rescinded, the shareholder shall not thereafter have any right to demand
payment of cash for the shareholder's shares pursuant to this chapter. The
court in any action attacking the validity of the reorganization or short-form
merger or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set aside or
rescinded shall not restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transaction
except upon 10 days' prior notice to the corporation and upon a determination
by the court that clearly no other remedy will adequately protect
the complaining shareholder or the class of shareholders of which such
shareholder is a member.

  



  

(c) If one of the parties to a reorganization or short-form merger is
directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control with, another
party to the reorganization or short-form merger, in any action to attack the
validity of the reorganization or short-form merger or to have the
reorganization or short-form merger set aside or rescinded, (1) a party to a
reorganization or short-form merger which controls another party to the
reorganization or short-form merger shall have the burden of proving that the
transaction is just and reasonable as to the shareholders of the controlled
party, and (2) a person who controls two or more parties to a reorganization
shall have the burden of proving that the transaction is just and reasonable
as to the shareholders of any party so controlled.

A conversion pursuant to Chapter 11.5 (commencing with Section 1150) shall be
deemed to constitute a reorganization for purposes of applying the provisions
of this chapter, in accordance with and to the extent provided in Section
1159.
