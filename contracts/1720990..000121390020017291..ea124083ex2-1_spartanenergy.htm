Spartan has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to Spartan and other material information
required to be disclosed by Spartan in the reports and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Spartan&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Spartan&rsquo;s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information required to be included in Spartan&rsquo;s periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act.</P>

Spartan maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP,
including policies and procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i)&nbsp;that Spartan maintains records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all material respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii)&nbsp;that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii)&nbsp;that receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board of directors; and (iv)&nbsp;regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect
on its financial statements. Spartan has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten,
a summary thereof) by any representative of Spartan to Spartan&rsquo;s independent auditors relating to any material weaknesses
in internal controls and any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls that would adversely affect
the ability of Spartan to record, process, summarize and report financial data. Spartan has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-blower
allegations, whether or not material, that involve management or other employees or consultants who have or had a significant role
in the internal control over financial reporting of Spartan. Since March 31, 2020, there have been no material changes in Spartan&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting.</P>

Spartan shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Spartan as promptly as practicable,
the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however that

recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense
that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking,
the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable
standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not
parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee
has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation
to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.</P>

of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent
corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of &sect; 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation.
Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to &sect; 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by &sect; 251(h)
of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the
appraisal of such holder&rsquo;s shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission

entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation
shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if
such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant
to &sect; 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by &sect; 251(h) of this title
and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled
to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder&rsquo;s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit
of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that
such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of
determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date
that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the
notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which the notice is given.</P>

consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such
fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for
good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of
payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment
of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of
(1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest
theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder
entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder&rsquo;s
certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.</P>
