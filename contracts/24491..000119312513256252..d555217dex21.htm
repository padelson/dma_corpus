conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of the Company Common Stock (such issued and outstanding shares of the

by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent and any shares of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

WHEREAS, Dutch Holdco is a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, and owns all of
the issued and outstanding stock of Apollo Vredestein B.V. (" _Apollo
Vredestein_ ") and of Merger Sub.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered or caused to be delivered to the Company the irrevocable
standby letter of credit (the " _Letter of Credit_ ") in favor of the Company

waiver of all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of any
such condition) set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the

the Marketing Period.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The parties to this Agreement shall cause the

of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may agree in writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and
time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate
of Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing, being the
" _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without

Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,

case, subject to  _Section 6.7_ hereof). The certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub is set forth as Exhibit A hereto.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The

or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation.

or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent Parties, the
Company or the holders of Shares or securities of the Parent Parties:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_) will be
cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive $35.00
in cash, without interest, payable to the holder of each Share (the "
_Merger Consideration_ ") upon surrender of either certificates formerly
representing such Shares (" _Certificates_ ") or any book-entry Shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") in the manner provided in  _Section 2.2_. All such
Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be
automatically cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect
to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

 

(b) Each (i) Share held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) Share owned by
Ultimate Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Ultimate
Parent immediately before the Effective Time, and (iii) Dissenting Share will
be cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be
made with respect to such shares subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares,
to the right of the holder thereof to receive any payment under _Section
2.4_.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



-3-  Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a U.S. national bank or
trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent
for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_
") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.1(a)_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a separate account for the
benefit of holders of Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ ") the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_.

(b) (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in
any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery
will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) to the Paying Agent or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in
customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.2(f)_) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of
such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter surrender such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent under cover of the
letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a valid
letter of transmittal and the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares
on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares
represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares. Until so
surrendered, Certificates (other than Shares held by Ultimate Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent and shares held
in the treasury of the Company) or Book-Entry Shares will represent solely the
right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the Shares
represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares.

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered
Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Tax is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions, in each case with

 



-4-   a record date (A) prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by the Company on such Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or (B) prior to the date of this Agreement, and in each case which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Companys capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares,
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates
representing Shares held by Ultimate Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent and shares held in the treasury of the
Company) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as provided in this
_ARTICLE II_. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which immediately before the
Effective Time represented the Shares. 

(d) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent will deliver to the Surviving Corporation any cash,
including any interest received with respect to such cash, and any
Certificates or other documents in its possession relating to the
Transactions, which had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have
not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or
previously delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders
will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on
such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to
any holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_,
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares
or other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

(f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or,
at the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in such customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed 

 



-5-   Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the number
of Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

(g) The Paying Agent will invest all cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such cash will
be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, and, in any such case, no such instrument will have a maturity
exceeding three months, and that no such investment or loss thereon will
affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments will be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent will promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment
Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans (an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as
of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be adjusted and
converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Option and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock set forth in such Option, less any required
withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "), and as of the Effective
Time each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. The Option Cash
Payment shall be made at the time required under the applicable Company Stock
Plan and related award or other applicable document, but in any event promptly
(and no later than 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time.

(b) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan (other than awards of
Options, the treatment of which is specified in _Section 2.3(a)_) entitling
the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or
based on the value of Shares (a " _Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding or
payable as of the Effective Time shall be adjusted and converted into the
right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) (A) in the case of Share Units subject to
performance-based vesting conditions which have been notionally earned by an
employee for measurement periods completed prior to the Effective Time but
not yet settled, the number of shares of Company Common Stock determined based
on actual achievement of the applicable performance goals for such measurement
periods, (B) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting
conditions for a measurement period that has begun and is not complete as of
the Effective Time (and which as a result have not been notionally earned by
an employee prior to the Effective Time) (a " _Non-Earned Share Based PSU_
"), the number of shares of Company Common Stock determined as if the
applicable performance goals had been achieved for such measurement

 



-6-   period at the target level of performance, prorated for the number of days
between the commencement of the applicable measurement period and the
Effective Time as compared to the number of days in the entire measurement
period, and (C) in the case of Share Units not subject to performance-based
vesting conditions, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Share Units, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any
required withholding Taxes (the " _Share Unit Payment_ "). As of the Effective
Time each holder of a Share Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except (I) the right to receive the Share Unit Payment and (II) as
described in _Section 6.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Share
Unit Payment shall be made at the time required under the applicable Company
Stock Plan and related award or other applicable document, but in any event
promptly (and no later than 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time;
provided, however, in the event that making such payment at such time would
cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code
with respect to a Share Unit, the payment shall instead be made at the time
specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and related award or other
applicable document.

(c) All account balances (whether or not vested) under any Company Plan (other
than awards under a Company Stock Plan the treatment of which is specified in
_Section 2.3(a)_ or  _(b)_ ) that provides for the deferral of compensation
and represents amounts notionally invested in a number of shares of Company
Common Stock or otherwise provides for distributions or benefits that are
calculated based on the value of a Share (collectively, the " _Deferred
Compensation Plans_ "), shall be adjusted and converted into a right of the
holder to have allocated to the holders account under any such Deferred

the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously deemed invested under
or otherwise referenced by such account and (ii) the Merger Consideration,
less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Deferred Payment_ "), and shall

exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company shall occur as a
result of any merger, business combination, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
reflect such change; provided that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

the legal department), is a Governmental Entity;

 



-16-  (xiv) Contract pursuant to which (A) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its Joint Ventures grants to any third party any license, release,
covenant not to sue or similar right with respect to any material Owned

(xv) Contract that contains any provision expressly requiring the Company or

business or (z) the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make,
sell or distribute any products or services, in each case, in any material
respect.

Any such Contract described in clauses (i)-(xv) is a " _Material Contract_."

(b) A true and correct copy of each Material Contract has previously been made
available to Parent (except with such redactions as may be clearly marked on
such copy) and each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
each other party thereto, subject to the General Enforceability Exceptions,
and is in full force and effect in all material respects. Except as would not

Adverse Effect, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no other party is) in default under

not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by
the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of a Parent
Party specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 

Section 3.11 _Litigation_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Joint Ventures
is party to, is subject to or is in default under the provisions of any
Order, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

Section 3.12 _Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

(a) As used herein, the term " _Company Plan_ " shall mean each material
employee benefit plan (including but not limited to "employee benefit plans"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), "voluntary employees beneficiary
associations" under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (each, a " _VEBA_ ") and
each other material equity incentive, compensation, severance, employment,
change-in-control, termination, retention, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive,
stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, stock-based, savings,
retirement, deferred compensation, health and welfare, or other benefit plan,
agreement, program, policy or Contract, whether or not subject to ERISA
(including any related funding mechanism), in each case other than a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (" _Multiemployer
Plan_ "), under which (i) any current or former employee, officer, director,
contractor or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Covered
Employees_ ") has any present or future right to benefits and which are
entered into, contributed to, sponsored by or maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
present or future liability. With respect to each material Company Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, true, correct
and complete copies of (1) all documents embodying such Company Plan,
including (without limitation) all amendments thereto and all related trust
documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, (2) written
descriptions of any Company Plans that are not set forth in a written
document, (3) the most recent summary plan description for each applicable
Company Plan, together with the summary or summaries of material
modifications thereto, (4) the two most recent annual actuarial valuations,
(5) the most recent determination or opinion letter issued by the IRS with
respect to any Company Plan and related trust intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and any pending request for such a determination
letter and (6) the two most recent annual reports (Form 5500 or 990 series and
all schedules and financial statements attached thereto).

(b) Each Company Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code. All contributions required to be made
under each Company Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been timely
made and all obligations in respect of each Company Plan have been properly
accrued and reflected in the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or
incorporated by reference in the Company Financial Statements prior to the
date of this Agreement. No Company Plan is in "at-risk" status (within the
meaning of Section 303(i)(4)(A) of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4)(A) of the
Code).

(c) Each Company Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter to
that effect from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred since the date of such determination or opinion that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect such

 



-18-   determination. Any VEBA, which provides benefits under a Company Plan, has
(i) received an opinion letter from the IRS recognizing its exempt status
under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and (ii) filed a timely notice with the
IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of
circumstances likely to result in the loss of such exempt status under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(d) No condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates to any material direct or indirect liability
under Title IV of ERISA or to a civil penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or
liability under Section 4069 of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976, 4980B or 4980F of
the Code. No "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
(excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has
been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with
respect to any Company Plan or will be required to be filed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, nor has any event
described in Sections 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred.

(e) No Company Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA which is a single-employer plan (a " _Pension
Plan_ ") had a "funding shortfall" within the meaning of Section 430(c) of
the Code or Section 303(c) of ERISA as of January 1, 2012, and there has been
no material adverse change in the financial condition, whether or not as a
result of a change in the funding method, of such Pension Plan since January
1, 2012. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries participates in, nor
has within the six years prior to the date of this Agreement participated in,
any Multiemployer Plan. With respect to any Multiemployer Plan contributed to
by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
material withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA which remains
unsatisfied.

(f) No Actions are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
with respect to any Company Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under
any Company Plan or collective bargaining agreement. The Company or its
Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any retiree health and life benefits at
any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of
claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

(g) (i) Each Company Plan that is maintained primarily for the benefit of
Covered Employees based outside of the United States (a " _Non-U.S. Plan_ ")
has been operated in accordance and is in substantial compliance with its
terms and all applicable Laws; and (ii) each Non-U.S. Plan that is required to
be funded is funded to the extent required by applicable Law, and with respect
to all other Non-U.S. Plans, reserves therefore have been established as
required on the accounting statements of the applicable Company or Subsidiary
of the Company.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to gross up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise taxes, interest
or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 



-19-  (i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter or as expressly provided in this Agreement, the
consummation of the Transactions will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any material severance pay, material
unemployment compensation or any other material payment, (ii) materially
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount
of compensation, due any such employee or officer, or result in any funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under any
of the Company Plans, or (iii) require a "gross-up" or other payment to any
"disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
due to the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on any
payment to such disqualified individual or result in payments under any of the
Company Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section
280G of the Code. The Company has made available to Parent complete copies of
the Section 280G calculations prepared with respect to the individuals set
forth in _Section 3.12(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.13 _Labor Matters_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.13_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement or other
material Contract with a labor union or labor organization, nor is the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any material Action that
asserts that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair
labor practice or that seeks to compel it to bargain with any labor union or
labor organization, nor is there pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has there been for the past five years, any labor strike or
lock-out or any material dispute, walk-out, work stoppage or slow-down
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the
Company, as of the date hereof there are no material organizational efforts
with respect to the formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being
made involving any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company has previously made available to Parent correct and complete copies of
all collective bargaining agreements (and any similar agreement between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a union or similar
group bargaining unit of employees, on the other hand, regulating the terms
and conditions of such employees in the workplace) and material labor
agreements or other material Contracts with a labor union or labor
organization to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by
which any of them are otherwise bound (collectively, the " _Company Labor
Agreements_ "). The consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions
will not entitle any third party (including any labor union or labor
organization) to any material payments under any of the Company Labor
Agreements. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices
(including equal employment opportunity laws), terms and conditions of
employment, workers compensation, occupational safety and health, affirmative
action, employee privacy, plant closings and wages and hours, except as would
not be material. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent
in any payments to their respective employees for any wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any material respect. Since the
Applicable Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
any liability or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act

 



-20-   and the regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar state or local Law
that remains unsatisfied.

Permitted Encumbrances. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,

and (ii) there is no default under any lease for the Leased Real Property
either by the Company or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

Joint Ventures own or have the right to use all material Intellectual
Property and material IT Assets required to operate their businesses as

the Financing.

Ultimate Parent, any Parent Party or any of the Parent Parties respective
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, in the case of clause
(ii)(y) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, losses,

respective Subsidiaries owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of
record), or is a party to any Contract for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of, any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement).

Section 4.5 _Information in Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by any Parent Party in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Special

Financing Documents have not been withdrawn, modified, terminated, expired or
rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date

date of this Agreement, (a) no event has occurred which would reasonably be

of the Parent Parties under the Financing Documents or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party to the Financing Documents and (b) Parent has no
Knowledge that the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that

Company, (ii) any customary engagement letter(s) and non-disclosure
agreements(s), and (iii) as do not impact the conditionality or aggregate

Persons, which Company Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of
this _Section 5.2_ (other than any violation that is immaterial in scope or
effect), the Company and its Representatives may to the extent that the
Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors
and legal counsel, that the failure to take such action, in light of the
Company Takeover Proposal and the terms of this Agreement would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and that such Company Takeover

 



-35-   Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
following execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such
Person, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made
such Company Takeover Proposal; provided, that the Company shall, prior to
such disclosure, provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is made available to such Person to
the extent not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (y)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person or group of Persons making such Company Takeover Proposal.

(c) The Company shall inform Parent promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) of any proposals or offers with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal,
any request for non-public information or any discussions are sought to be
initiated or continued with it or any of its Representatives (indicating the
identity of the Person making the inquiry or proposal and the material terms
of any such proposal, including copies of related written requests, offers or
proposed contracts) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of
any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours of
any material development, discussion or negotiation). In the event that any
Person modifies its Company Takeover Proposal in any material respect (it
being understood that any change in financial terms and any formal written
modification shall be deemed material), the Company shall notify Parent in
writing within 24 hours of receipt of such modification of the fact that such
Company Takeover Proposal has been modified and the terms of such modification
(including, if applicable, copies of written documentation reflecting such
modification). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter
into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this _Section 5.2_ or that contains terms less restrictive
with respect to such Person than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.2(d)_ or _Section
5.2(e)_, the Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) take
any action by board resolution or in any public respect or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a customary
"stop, look and listen" communication (it being understood that the Company
Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal until the close of business as of the tenth U.S. Business Day
after the commencement of a tender offer in connection with such Company
Takeover Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without
such action being considered a modification of the Company Recommendation
adverse to Parent, provided, that if the Company Board fails to take a
position or takes a position after the close of business on such tenth U.S.
Business Day that is other than a recommendation against such offer then such
position shall be considered a modification of the Company Recommendation
adverse to Parent) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover
Proposal (the actions described in this clause (i) being referred 

 



-36-   to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause
or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement or other similar Contract
with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 5.2(b)_)
(each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iii) take any action
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Stockholder Approval
is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or take any action pursuant
to _Section 8.1(c)_ if prior to taking such action the Company Board or any
duly constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel, that
(x) failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; provided, however, that (1) the
Company has given Parent at least five calendar days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall include an unredacted
copy of the Company Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements and an unredacted copy of any financing
commitments relating thereto), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
in writing an offer binding on Parent to effect revisions to the terms of
this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such
notice period, the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof shall have considered in good faith such binding offer, and
shall have determined that the Company Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed in such
binding offer were to be given effect, (4) in the event of any material
change to the terms of such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood
that any change in financial terms and any formal written modification shall
be deemed material), the Company shall, in each case, again comply with this
_Section 5.2(d)_ and shall have delivered to Parent an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (1) above and the notice period shall
have recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least three
calendar days rather than the five calendar days otherwise contemplated by
clause (1) above, and, if applicable, (5) the Company Board (or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof) terminates this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1(c)_ to enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal; and provided,
further, that the Company has complied with its obligations under this
_Section 5.2_ (other than any violation that is immaterial in scope or
effect); and provided, further, that any purported termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and effect,
unless the termination is in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)_ and, to the
extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the
applicable Termination Fee in accordance with  _Section 8.2(b)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

(e) Prior to the time the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board
may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in
_Section 5.2(d)(i)(B)_ (" _Change of Recommendation_ ") if and only if (or to
the extent permitted in _Section 5.2(d)_) (i) the Company Board or any duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, 

 



-37-   that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) such action is not in
response to the receipt, existence of or terms of a Company Takeover Proposal
or a Company Superior Proposal or any inquiry related thereto or the
consequences thereof (which is governed by _Section 5.2(d)_); (iii) such
action is only in response to a material development, fact, change, event,
effect, occurrence or circumstance that is not, or the material consequences
of which are not, known or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of
the date hereof and becomes known to the Company Board prior to the time of
the Stockholder Approval (excluding any Company Takeover Proposal, the "
_Intervening Event_ "); and (iv) prior to taking such action, (w) the Company
Board has given Parent at least five calendar days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice shall describe the Intervening
Event and the basis for such intended Change of Recommendation in reasonable
detail, (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with the Parent Parties during such notice period
after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate,
to enable Parent to propose in writing an offer binding on the Parent Parties
to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement and (y) at the end of such
notice period, the Company Board or any duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof shall have considered in good faith any such binding offer,
and shall have determined in good faith, based on the information then
available and after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that failure to make such Change of Recommendation due to the
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or in _Section 6.6_ shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if, in the Company Boards determination in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel, such disclosure is required under
applicable Law; provided, however, that if any such disclosure has the
substantive effect of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it shall be
deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. 

(g) The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such
Persons consideration of an acquisition of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. The Company
further agrees to enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement and
shall take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been
granted to any Person other than Parent or its Affiliates under any
confidentiality or standstill provisions in any such agreement.

advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective in the
most expeditious manner possible the Transactions including (i) the

Parties, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and
shall not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained prior to Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement with respect to and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, promptly provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their
counsel) copies of), and keep the other parties apprised of the status of, all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Each party to
this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement of
any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
Transactions. If any party to this Agreement or any Representative of such
parties receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party
will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and,
to the extent permitted by Law, after consultation with the other parties

 



-40-   to this Agreement and permitting counsel to the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Each party agrees that it will not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the performance of its obligations
pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_ unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no later than 20 Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, any other filings and/or notifications under
applicable Antitrust Laws, and in each case, if applicable, requesting early
termination of any waiting period with respect to the Transactions, and to
file as soon as practicable any other applicable notifications or other forms
and documentation necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals
under or in connection with any applicable Antitrust Law or in connection with
the approval or authorization of or filings with any Governmental Entity

their respective Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking
of any action contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall use

inquiries and requests received from the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to all
inquiries and requests for additional information and documentation received
from any state Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity in connection
with approvals of or filings with any other Governmental Entity required to be
obtained or made by the Parent Parties, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any
action contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions under applicable Antitrust Laws. In
connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or
state or foreign Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ") or otherwise challenged by any
Governmental Entity, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use
all reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action,
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger or any other Transactions, including by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section
6.3_ shall limit the right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, so long as such party hereto is not in material
breach of its obligations under this _Section 6.3_. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods

 



-41-   under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, contract or
Order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Parent Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates in any manner or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates, in each case, if such action would or would reasonably
be expected to result in or be a Burdensome Condition; provided that, if
requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer
or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order
is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs. For the
purposes of this Agreement, " _Burdensome Condition_ " means the executing or
carrying out, consenting to or to offer to or to agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement (including consent decrees and undertakings) in
respect of, in anticipation of or pursuant to any action contemplated by this
_Section 6.3_ that, individually or in the aggregate with all other such
actions, would reasonably be expected to result in any sale, divestiture,
hold separate arrangement or other disposition of business, product lines or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or Parent and its Affiliates, if
such business or assets, in the aggregate, together generated (directly or
indirectly), revenues of more than $150,000,000 reported for the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2012 calculated in accordance with GAAP.

 

Section 6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent
Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence would be reasonably
likely to cause any condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied and (b) any
material failure of the Company or any Parent Party, as the case may be, or
any Representative of the Company or Parent Party, as applicable, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice.
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any written notice from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person in connection with a Material
Contract is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.

 

Section 6.5 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the
Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, Parent
and its Representatives, from time to time prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, reasonable access
during 

 



-42-   normal business hours to (i) the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective
properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and (ii) such
other information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial
condition and operations, in each case, to the extent related to consummation
of the Transactions or the ownership or operation of the respective
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing,
provided that the foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company, after consultation with legal counsel, would result in the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets or competitively sensitive sales and marketing
information of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure or (b) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. If the Company seeks to withhold information from the
Parent Parties for any reason permitted by this _Section 6.5_, the Company
and the Parent Parties shall cooperate to implement appropriate and mutually
agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner
to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate
clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense
agreement with respect to any information to be so provided. All information
provided shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.6  _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger
shall be joint and thereafter neither the Company nor the Parent Parties shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior consultation
of the other party and giving the other party the opportunity to review and
comment on such press release or other announcement, except to the extent
required by Law or by any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable
national securities exchange, trading market or listing authority, or as may
be requested by a Governmental Entity.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any other Person that is or
was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans
maintained or sponsored by the Company, together with such persons heirs,
executors or administrators, (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) incurred in connection with
any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (i) the fact that an Indemnified Party
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or any such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent,
trustee or fiduciary of another Person) or (ii) acts or omissions by such
Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director or officer
of the

 



-43-   Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or taken at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under (i) or (ii), at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole
or in part to the Merger or the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to the fullest
extent permitted or required by applicable Law or that the Company would have
been required under its certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect on
the date of this Agreement (and made available to the Parent Parties), to
indemnify such Indemnified Party. In addition, from the Effective Time
until six years from the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, advance any expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_
(including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
referred to in this _Section 6.7_) as incurred to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been required under its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement, provided that the individual
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to this  _Section 6.7(a)_.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will assume,
all obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
rights of exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the respective constituent documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any written Contract described on the
Company Disclosure Letter or filed as an exhibit to any document filed with
the SEC; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any Action pending or asserted or any claim made in accordance with the
applicable provisions thereof will continue until the disposition of such
Action or resolution of such claim. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent,
from and after the Effective Time until six years from the Effective Time,
will cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Companys constituent documents, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies or purchase
or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy" with
reputable insurers, in each case of at least the same coverage and scope, and
in amounts, and containing terms and conditions, that are no less favorable to
such individuals than such policy in effect on the date hereof, with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time covering without limitation
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that after the Effective Time, Parent will not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained
pursuant hereto, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount; and provided further, that

 



-44-   if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the same coverage
costs on an annual basis more than 300% of such last annual premium, the
Surviving Corporation will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can
be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. The Company may prior to the
Effective Time purchase a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall
not pay an aggregate amount for such policy in excess of 450% of the current
aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for the existing policy, and
the Company shall reasonably consult with Parent regarding the purchase of
such "tail policy" prior to the purchase of such "tail policy". If such
prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it will be deemed
to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section
6.7(c)_ and the Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ will survive the consummation of
the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under
the Companys constituent documents, by Contract or otherwise. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.7_ may not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies unless (i) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii)
the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies will be third party beneficiaries
of this  _Section 6.7_).

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.7_.

 

Section 6.8 _Parent and Company Compliance_. Whenever this Agreement requires
a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company
to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From the Effective Time until December 31, 2014, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of the Company
and its 

 



-45-   Subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of employment were not, and do not
become, subject to a collective bargaining agreement (the " _Company Non-Union
Employees_ ") compensation and benefits (excluding equity awards) that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits
(including the initial estimated value of any equity awards) provided to each
such Company Non-Union Employee immediately before the Effective Time. As to
each current and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries whose
terms and conditions of employment were subject to a collective bargaining
agreement (the _"Company Union Employees"_ ), the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to comply with the terms and conditions of each
applicable collective bargaining agreement, in a manner consistent with
applicable Law.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any pension plan sponsored
by Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries))
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Non-Union Employees after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Company Non-Union Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors
before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Non-
Union Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar employee benefit plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such Company Non-Union Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Non-Union Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Company Plan in which such Company Non-Union Employee participated
immediately before the consummation of the Transactions (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Non-Union Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as
applicable, will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Section 6.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

__(d) To the extent that, prior to the Effective Time, Parent enters into an
agreement with any beneficiary of the Amended and Restated Master Grantor
Trust Agreement, dated January 1, 2011, between the Company and PNC Bank,
National Association (the " _Rabbi_

 



-46-    _Trust_ ") that provides for waiver of the funding of the Rabbi Trust for
all or a portion of such beneficiarys benefits under any applicable plan or
agreement, the Company shall cause the trustee of the Rabbi Trust to refund
to the Company any amounts contributed to the Rabbi Trust for such
beneficiarys benefits, to the extent funding thereof has been waived by the
applicable beneficiary.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending or terminating
any employee benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely
for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in
this _Section 6.9_, express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Non-
Union Employee and Company Union Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.10 _Dutch Holdco Approval_. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, Dutch Holdco shall execute and deliver, in accordance with
Section 251 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, a written consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Parent Party
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be
taken) all action and to do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Documents, including (i) maintaining in effect the Financing Documents
(including any applicable market flex provision), (ii) negotiating
and entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions no less favorable than those contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(which may include amending any or all of the Commitment Letter and any
related fee letter from time to time between the date hereof and the Closing
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities as a party thereto and the Parent Parties shall promptly deliver to
the Company copies of any such amendment or modification), provided that such
terms do not (1) reduce the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds available
from the Financing, (2) introduce new or additional conditions or that
otherwise prevent, impede, delay, impair or reduce the availability of the
Financing or the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger as of
the Closing in any respect or (3) adversely impact the ability of any Parent
Party to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing
Documents in any respect (any such agreements, together with the Facility
Agreement and any agreement contemplated thereby, the " _Financing Definitive
Agreements_ "), and execute and deliver to the Company a copy thereof as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and no later than two Business Days) after
such execution; (iii) satisfying on a timely basis (and in any event, on or
prior to the Closing) all conditions applicable to the Parent Parties
set forth in the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements
within their control, (iv) consummating the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Documents at or prior to the Closing, (v) fully enforcing the
obligations of the other parties to the Financing Documents or the Financing
Definitive Agreements (and the rights of the Parent Parties), including (at
the

 



-47-   request of the Company) by filing one or more lawsuits against the other
parties to the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements to
fully enforce the obligations of the other parties to the Financing Documents
or the Financing Definitive Agreements (and the rights of the Parent Parties);
provided, however, that the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the
funding of the Financing shall be subject to the satisfaction of all
conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), (vi) complying in
all material respects with its covenants and other obligations under the
Financing Documents and (vii) utilizing any and all available financing to
refinance any existing Indebtedness that becomes unavailable. Parent may
replace any Financing Source with an alternative Financing Source with the
written consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
Parent Party will permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of,
or waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Financing Documents to the
extent such amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver that would (1)
reduce the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds available from the
Financing, (2) introduce new or additional conditions or that would otherwise
prevent, impede, delay, impair or reduce the availability of the Financing or
the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger as of the Closing
in any respect or (3) adversely impact the ability of any Parent Party to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Documents in any
respect. The Parent Parties will deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification, replacement or waiver as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and no later than two Business Days) prior to the execution
thereof. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Parent
Parties may cancel or terminate a portion of the commitments provided under
the Financing Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements to the extent
the Parent Parties have completed an offering of debt securities and received
proceeds in an amount of the commitments so cancelled or terminated so long
as (A) such proceeds have been contributed to Merger Sub, (B) such proceeds
are subject to an escrow acceptable to the Company, and (C) no term or
condition related to such transaction is reasonably likely to prevent,
impede, delay or impair the availability of the Financing (other than the
portion so cancelled or terminated) or the ability of the Parent Parties to
consummate the Merger as of the Closing.

 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of the
material definitive documents for the Financing. The Parent Parties will
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification, replacement
or waiver in respect of the Financing Documents as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) upon the
execution and delivery thereof. Parent shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) notify the Company of
(i) the expiration or termination of the Financing Documents or the Financing
Definitive Agreements, (ii) any refusal by the other parties to the Financing
Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements to provide, any written
notice or other written communication by the other parties to the Financing
Documents or the Financing Definitive Agreements of any intention to refuse to
provide, or asserting that it no longer has an obligation and/or ability to
provide, the full financing contemplated by the Financing Documents or the
Financing Definitive Agreements, (iii) any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
any Financing Documents or

 



-48-   Financing Definitive Agreements the effect of which would relieve the
Financing Sources from the obligation to provide the Financing in any manner
(including in diminution of amount) or would reasonably be expected to delay
the consummation of any portion of the funding of the Financing and (iv) the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from a Financing
Source with respect to any (x) actual or potential material breach, material
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Documents or
any Financing Definitive Agreements or any provisions of the Financing
Documents or any Financing Definitive Agreements the effect of which would
relieve the Financing Sources from the obligation to provide the Financing or
(y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Documents or any Financing Definitive Agreements the effect of which
would relieve the Financing Sources from the obligation to provide the
Financing. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a periodic
basis of any material developments, discussions or negotiations relating to
any circumstance referred to the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be required to provide
any information under this _Section 6.11_ if such disclosure would result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege. 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Documents or the Financing
Definitive Agreements (it being understood that Parent shall be required to
exercise any applicable market flex provision) or any of the Financing
Documents or Financing Definitive Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated,
terminated or rescinded, in each case regardless of the reason therefor,
Parent shall (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event,
within two Business Days) notify the Company of such unavailability and the
reason therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event and
in any event no later than the final day of the Marketing Period, alternative
debt financing (in an amount sufficient to replace such unavailable
Financing) from the same or other sources; provided that in no event shall
Parent be obligated to obtain alternative debt financing on terms and
conditions that are in the aggregate materially less favorable to the Parent
Parties and the Company than such unavailable Financing (including any
applicable market flex provision).

(d) Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
agreements (including any fee letters and engagement letters, provided that
amounts in such letters may be redacted unless such redactions would
adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability or availability of
the Financing) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide any of the Parent Parties with any portion of the
Financing. Any alternative financing will (x) be in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Merger (including paying the Merger Consideration, and all fees
and expenses) and (y) not impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing
in a manner that would (i) delay or prevent the Closing in any respect or (ii)
make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur in any respect. In the event
any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.11_
(" _Alternative Financing_ "), references in this Agreement to the Financing
shall be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing (in lieu of the
Financing replaced thereby, and except for purposes of _Section 5.1(c)_), and
if one or more commitment letters, facility agreements or definitive
agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered

 



-49-   into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Commitment Letter, the Facility Agreement and the Financing
Definitive Agreements shall be deemed to refer to such commitment letters,
facility agreements and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing (in lieu of the Commitment Letter, the Facility
Agreement and the Financing Definitive Agreements replaced thereby), and
all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ shall be
applicable thereto to the same extent as Parents obligations with respect to
the Financing replaced thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ will
require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of the Parent
Parties be deemed or construed to require, any Parent Party pay any fees, any
interest rates or other amounts applicable to the Financing in excess of
those contemplated by the Financing Documents (after the exercise of any
market flex provisions) and whether to secure waiver of any conditions
contained therein or otherwise; provided that the Parent Parties shall pay
all fees required by the Financing Documents as they become due.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to provide and to cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives, including legal,
finance and accounting, to provide, to the Parent Parties, at Parents sole
expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any permitted replacement,
amended, modified or alternative financing (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries), including:

(i) furnishing the Parent Parties as promptly as practicable following
Parents request, (A) financial statements, financial data and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type required by
SEC Regulation S-X and SEC Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (excluding

specifically to the Financing (other than historical information relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries and forward looking information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries otherwise required by applicable Law)) and
(B) information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
information to be used in the preparation of one or more information packages
(including customary confidential information, memoranda, offering circulars
or prospectuses) regarding the business, operations and business plan or

arrangement and/or syndication of loans as contemplated by the Financing
Documents, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent to assist in
preparation of customary offering or information documents or rating agency or
lender or investor presentations relating to such placement, arrangement
and/or syndication of loans; provided, that any memoranda or prospectuses need
not be issued by the Company or any of its Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Required Information_ ");

 

(ii) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub as promptly as practicable, with such
financial and other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
the receipt of which is an express condition to the obligations of a Financing
Source under a Financing Document or Financing Definitive Agreement, including

delivered thereunder;

 



-50-  (iii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary
one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for,

Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting

including making available a reasonable number of times, at reasonable times
and locations, Representatives of the Company and members of the Companys

business to be included in offering documents contemplated by the Financing
and reviewing and commenting on the draft business description; provided that
any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in relation to debt securities
need not be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and provided,
further, that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses shall contain
disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation
and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; 

(v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries customary for financings similar
to the Financing and reasonably requested by Parent;

(vi) taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the

the Contracts set forth on _Section 6.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _Required Consents_ "). Parent and the Company shall reasonably

opinions, assurances or documents, and subject to applicable Law, such
information as may reasonably be requested in connection therewith, in each
case, in consultation with each other and accepting the reasonable comments
and views of the other party.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall amend,
modify, supplement or waive the terms and conditions of the Contracts set
forth on _Section 6.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter without the prior
consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Parent Parties_. Each Parent Party
shall have performed or complied in all material respects with the covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
it prior to or on the Closing Date.

(c) _Officer s Certificate_. Each Parent Party shall have furnished the

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Parent Parties
nor the Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be
satisfied to excuse it from its obligation to effect the Merger if such
failure was caused by such partys breach of its obligations under this
Agreement or, in the case of the Parent Parties, the Financing Documents.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
Stockholder Approval):

(a) by mutual written consent of each Parent Party and the Company; 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2013 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to
any party that has breached in any material respect any provision of this
Agreement or, in the case of the Parent Parties, the Financing Documents,
where such breach has been the cause of the failure to consummate the Merger;

(ii) any Order in an appropriate jurisdiction which is final and nonappealable
shall have been issued or taken restraining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have
used all reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of such Order to the
extent required by and subject to _Section 6.3_; or

 

(iii) if the Special Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements
thereof) shall have concluded without the Stockholder Approval having been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote of the holders
of Shares;

(c) by the Company prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, in order
to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Company Superior Proposal; provided that the Company is not in breach of
_Section 5.2_, including its obligations in _Section 5.2(c)_ and _Section
5.2(d)_ (other than any breach that is immaterial in scope or effect), and
shall have paid or shall concurrently pay the fees due under _Section
8.2(b)_; 

(d) by Parent prior to the Special Meeting, if the Company Board (i) shall
have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Change of Recommendation
or (ii) shall have failed to reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any
event within three Business Days after receipt 

 



-56-   of any written request to do so from Parent) at any time following the
public disclosure or announcement by a 5% Holder of opposition to the
Transactions (provided, that the Company shall be required to reaffirm its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger once per 5%
Holder), except, with respect to this clause (d)(ii), in the event the Company
Board has received a Company Takeover Proposal, in which case Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (d)(ii)
so long as the Company Board makes a statement to the effect that it is
reviewing or considering the Company Takeover Proposal within three Business
Days after receipt of Parents written request for reaffirmation;

(e) by the Company, if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants
or failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties on the part
of Parent, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate (A) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in  _Section
7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ and (B) which is not cured within the earlier of (1)
the Outside Date and (2) 30 days following written notice to Parent; provided,
that (x) the Company shall have given Parent written notice, delivered at
least 30 days prior to such termination (or promptly, if such notice is given
within 30 days of the Outside Date), stating the Companys intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(e)_ and the basis
for such termination and (y) the Company will not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement;

(f) by Parent, if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or
failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties on the part of
the Company which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the
aggregate (A) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ and (B) which is not cured within the earlier of (1)
the Outside Date and (2) 30 days following written notice to the Company;
provided, that Parent shall have given the Company written notice, delivered
at least 30 days prior to such termination (or promptly, if such notice is
given within 30 days of the Outside Date), stating Parents intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ and the basis for
such termination; provided, further, that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ if Parent is then
in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(g) by the Company, if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and the conditions
set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) are
satisfied, (ii) the Company has confirmed by written notice to Parent after
the end of the Marketing Period that all conditions set forth in _Section
7.3_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) or that it is willing to
waive any unsatisfied conditions in _Section 7.3_ and (iii) the Parent
Parties fail to consummate the Merger within three Business Days after the
delivery of such notice and the Company stood ready, willing and able to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby through
the end of such three Business Day period.

 

(h) A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the
other parties specifying with particularity the reason for such termination.
If more than one provision of this _Section 8.1_ is available to a
terminating party in connection with a termination, a

 



-57-   terminating party may rely on any and all available provisions in this
_Section 8.1_ for any such termination.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
(or any stockholder, director, officer, employee or Representative of such
party) to the other party hereto; provided, however, that the provisions of
_Section 6.6_, the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of the
Parent Parties pursuant to  _Section 6.11_, this _Section 8.2_, _ARTICLE
IX_ and _ARTICLE X_ hereof and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive such termination; provided further, however, no party will be
relieved or released from liability for damages of any kind, other than
exemplary, punitive or non-foreseeable consequential damages, arising out of
any (i) knowing material breach of any of its representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the Financing Documents or (ii) deliberate
material breach of any of its covenants contained in this Agreement or the
Financing Documents. For purposes of this _Section 8.2(a)_ and  _Section
9.10_, (A) a " _knowing breach_ " of a representation and warranty will be
deemed to have occurred only if the Company (in the case of the Company) or
the Parent Parties (in the case of the Parent Parties) is finally adjudicated
to have had Knowledge of such breach and (B) a " _deliberate breach_ " of any
covenant or agreement will be deemed to have occurred only if the party is
finally adjudicated to have taken or to have failed to take action with
Knowledge that the action so taken or omitted to be taken constituted a breach
of such covenant or agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to the provisions
of _Section 8.1(d)_, (ii) by the Company pursuant to the provisions of 
_Section 8.1(c)_ or (iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ and (A) prior to
such termination any Person publicly announces a Company Takeover Proposal
which shall not have been withdrawn and (B) at any time on or prior to the
first anniversary of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
consummates a transaction with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal or
the transactions contemplated by such Company Takeover Proposal are
consummated (provided that solely for purposes of this _Section
8.2(b)(iii)(B)_, the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
set forth in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal except that all
references to 15% shall be deemed references to 50%), the Company shall pay
Parent the Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer (to an account designated
by Parent) in immediately available funds (x) in the case of clause (i) of
this _Section 8.2(b)_, within two Business Days after such termination, (y)
in the case of clause (ii) of this _Section 8.2(b)_, prior to or
concurrently with such termination, and (z) in the case of clause (iii) of
this _Section 8.2(b)_, upon the earlier of entering into such definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal. " _Termination Fee_
" shall mean a cash amount equal to $50,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, payment of the Termination Fee shall
constitute liquidated damages, and from and after such termination as
described in this _Section 8.2(b)_, the Company shall have no further
liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement or the
termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under this _Section
8.2(b)_. In no event shall Parent be entitled to the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

 



-58-  (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_,
then Parent shall pay to the Company $112,500,000, in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (the _"_ _Reverse Termination Fee_ _"_ ), to an
account designated by the Company, no later than two Business Days after such
termination.

(d) The Company and the Parent Parties each acknowledge that the agreements
contained in  _Section 8.2(b)_ and _Section 8.2(c)_ are integral parts of
the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the Company and the
Parent Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company or Parent fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_, as applicable, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Company or any Parent Party, as applicable, commences a
claim, action, suit or other proceeding that results in a judgment against the
other party, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the other
party interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus 1%, together with reasonable legal fees and expenses
incurred in connection with such claim, suit, proceeding or other action.

(e) In the event that the conditions precedent to the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ have been satisfied
(including delivery to Parent of the written notice contemplated by clause
(ii) thereof and expiration of the three Business Day period contemplated by
clause (iii) thereof) and the Company elects to terminate this Agreement by
delivery to Parent of the written notice required pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_, such written notice shall specify the account to which payment
of the Reverse Termination Fee is to be made. Such notice shall also be
deemed notice to the Parent Parties of the Companys intent to demand payment
under the Letter of Credit in the event that the Parent Parties have not made
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee as contemplated by _Section 8.2(c)_.
Thereafter, on the first Business Day following the expiration of the period
specified in _Section 8.2(c)_, the Company may deliver a draw notice
under the Letter of Credit for payment of the Reverse Termination Fee. The
Company agrees that, within three Business Days following the first to occur
of (i) the receipt by the Company of the Reverse Termination Fee, (ii) the
termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Reverse
Termination Fee is not payable (other than in the event the Company has
terminated this Agreement pursuant to multiple provisions of _Section 8.1_,
including termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_) and (iii) the Closing,
the Company shall return the Letter of Credit to the issuing bank accompanied
by a notice requesting cancellation thereof in such form as may reasonably be
requested by the issuing bank (with a copy to the Parent Parties).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys
receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to _Section
8.2(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the
Subsidiaries of the Company, the holders of Shares and any of their
Affiliates (i) subject, solely with respect to Merger Sub, Dutch Holdco and
Parent, to the right to specific performance set forth in _Section 9.10_ or
to the extent of any damages finally adjudicated to result from a knowing
breach or a deliberate breach of this Agreement or the Financing Documents by
the Parent Parties or any of their Affiliates, against Parent, Dutch Holdco,
Merger Sub and the former, current and future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited

 



-59-   partners or assignees of Parent, Dutch Holdco and Merger Sub (collectively,
the " _Parent Entities_ ") and (ii) against any Financing Source and the
former, current and future equity holders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited
partners or assignees of any Financing Source or any of their respective
assets (collectively, the " _Financing Source Parties_ ") for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment
of such amount, none of the Parent Entities or the Financing Source Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall assert in any Action, and each
hereby irrevocably waives, any assertion or claim that the provisions of this
_Section 8.2(f)_ limiting the liability of the Parent Entities for the
matters described herein to the Reverse Termination Fee or the other
provisions of this _Section 8.2_ are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
whole or in part. Under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to
monetary damages from any Financing Source or Financing Source Party or
Parent Entity other than the Parent Parties.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources or the Financing Source Parties in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing Documents or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and appellate courts thereof).

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

 



-62-  Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
(b) except for the provisions in _Section 6.7_, (which provisions may be
enforced directly by Indemnified Parties) and _Section 8.2_, is not intended
to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their permitted assigns any rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever, other than (i) the right of the holders of Shares of the
Company to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim with
respect to which may not be made unless and until the Effective Time shall
have occurred), (ii) the right of the Company on behalf of its security
holders to enforce the provisions of this Agreement subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof and (iii) the rights of the Financing Sources
and the Financing Source Parties under _Section 8.2(e)_, _Section 8.2(f)_, 
_Section 8.2(g)_, _Section 9.1_, this _Section 9.6_ or _Section 9.11_
(which provisions may be enforced directly by the Financing Source Parties).
For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted pursuant to the foregoing
clause (ii) shall be enforceable only by the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion, on behalf of the holders of Shares of the Company. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without notice
or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties and
may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of
this Agreement. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible and the parties agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or
applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term
or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out
of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance

 



-63-   with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, subject to
_Section 8.2(g)_ with respect to Financing Sources and Financing Source
Parties, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal Action
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by
the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court
within the State of Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and
the federal courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state court within the State
of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court therefrom. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any Action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to
this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.8_, (b) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the Action in such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such Action is improper
or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in
or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service of process
upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if such
process is given as a notice in accordance with _Section 9.4_.

Section 9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the
parties to this Agreement (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 9.9_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns except
that the Parent Parties may assign, in their sole discretion, any of or all
their respective rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any
lender of the Parent Parties or the Surviving Corporation and that Parent may
designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary incorporated in the State of Delaware in lieu of Merger
Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed
references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other Subsidiary, and shall be true and correct in all respects, as of
the date of such designation; provided that any such assignment or designation
shall not impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise impede the rights of the
stockholders of the Company under this Agreement.

 



-64-  Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision hereof to the contrary, it is agreed that the Company
shall not be entitled to an injunction requiring Parent, Dutch Holdco or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger under this Agreement or cause the
Financing to be funded, except that the Company may seek specific performance
of the Parent Parties obligations to consummate the Merger if and only in the
event that (i) all conditions in _Sections 7.1_  and _7.2_ have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing but which conditions, at the time that the Company
seeks such specific performance pursuant to this  _Section 9.10_, are
capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time), (ii)
the Mauritius Financing has been drawn down and funded or will be drawn down
and funded at the Closing if the Committed Financing is funded at the Closing
and (iii) the Committed Financing (or, if Alternative Financing is being used
in accordance with _Section 6.11_, financing pursuant to the commitments with
respect thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the
Mauritius Financing is funded at the Closing. Under no circumstance shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance to cause the Financing to be funded and the Merger to
be consummated that results in the Closing pursuant to the foregoing sentence
and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee. Furthermore, except to the extent
of any damages finally adjudicated to result from a knowing breach or a
deliberate breach of this Agreement by the Company or the Parent Parties,
under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in
excess of any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_, and (B) under no
circumstances will Parent be entitled to monetary damages in excess of any
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_. Subject to the foregoing the
Parent Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any of the Parent Parties, and to
