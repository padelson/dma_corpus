applicable Acquired Asset or Assumed Contract and (iii) enforce any rights of
BH Media under or with respect to the applicable Acquired Asset or Assumed
Contract against all other Persons. In addition,  if any such third party
consent is not obtained before the Closing, Buyer shall perform the
obligations of BH Media under such Assumed Contract to the extent that such
obligation would have been an Assumed  Liability but for the fact that such
consent has not been so obtained, and Seller Entities shall provide to Buyer
the benefits of any such Assumed Contract. To the extent that an Acquired
Asset or Assumed Contract is an insurance policy and (a)  such policy is not
transferable or consent is not obtained to transfer such policy to Buyer and
(b) Buyer notifies the Seller Entities that Buyer is unable to procure an
adequate successor policy, Seller Entities shall maintain such policy, or,
if  unable to maintain such policy, purchase and maintain a tail policy to
such policy containing substantially similar terms and conditions, at Buyer's
expense, for the benefit of Buyer with respect to claims arising on or before
the Closing Date.

 

 

5.11 _Further Actions_. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
which may impose additional or different obligations, the Parties shall each
use  commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to satisfy as soon as  practicable all of the conditions required
to be satisfied by it hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as expeditiously as possible. Subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, each Party further understands and  agrees that
it shall not take, or cause or permit to be taken, any action that is
materially inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, nor shall a Party
take, or cause or permit to be taken any action that might materially delay or
hinder the  timely consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

ARTICLE 6 EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

 

 

6.1 _Acquired Employees_. Buyer or its Affiliates shall make offers of
employment to all BH Media Employees who are employed on the Closing  Date.
Any employment of a BH Media Employee with Buyer or its Affiliates will be
effective as of immediately following the Closing Date. Such offers of
employment shall be on terms and conditions substantially similar in the
aggregate to the  current terms of employment of each BH Media Employee,
within the current state of such BH Media Employee's current employment and
not more than 50 miles from such BH Media Employee's current employment
location. BH Media Employees who accept such  offer of employment and become
employees of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall be referred to in this
Agreement as " _Acquired Employees_."

 

 

6.2 _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. All collective bargaining agreements
covering Acquired Employees shall be  assumed by the Buyer at Closing and all
collective bargaining agreements covering employees of Buffalo News shall
survive the Closing. BH Media and Buyer understand and agree that BH Media may
have an obligation to engage in effects bargaining with  unions which are
certified to represent BH Media employees through collective bargaining to the
extent requested by such unions.

 

 

6.3 _Vacation_. The Assumed Liabilities shall include, and Buyer shall assume,
BH Media's Liability for all accrued, but unpaid vacation time of Acquired 
Employees.

 

 

 

16  

6.4 _Welfare Plans_.

 

 

(a) BH Media shall assign to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume the BH Media
Employee Benefit Plans to the extent that such assignment and assumption is
permitted under the terms of such plans  (the " _Assumed Plans_ "). Buyer
shall permit the Acquired Employees to continue active participation in
Assumed Plans until Buyer determines that it is advisable for the Acquired
Employees to commence participation in benefit plans maintained  by Buyer (or
its Affiliates) in accordance with the terms of Buyer's (or its Affiliates')
plans (the " _Buyer Welfare Plans_ " ). If any of the BH Media Employee
Benefit Plans is not assignable by BH Media or assumable by Buyer, then Buyer
will  use commercially reasonable efforts to permit any Acquired Employees
affected by such circumstances to participate in comparable Buyer Welfare
Plans. At such time as the Acquired Employees begin participation in any of
the Buyer Welfare Plans, for  all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the Buyer Welfare
Plans providing benefits to any Acquired Employees after the Closing, each
Acquired Employee shall subject to applicable Law and  applicable tax
qualification requirements be credited with his or her years of service with
BH Media or its Affiliates before the Closing, to the same extent as such
Acquired Employee was entitled, before the  Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar employee benefit plan in which such Acquired
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that  its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Acquired Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all Buyer  Welfare Plans. Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
an Acquired Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the applicable plan ending on the date such employee's
participation in the  corresponding Buyer Welfare Plan begins to be taken
into account under such Buyer Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered  dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Welfare Plan.

 

 

(b) To the extent that an Acquired Employee has not used all amounts deferred
to a health or limited purpose flexible spending account plan as of the
Closing Date, BH  Media shall transfer to Buyer in cash any positive balance
in such Acquired Employee's health or limited purpose flexible spending
account as of the Closing Date to the extent not otherwise included in the
Acquired Assets, and Buyer shall assume  all obligations with respect to that
Acquired Employee's health or limited purpose flexible spending account plan
balance.

 

 

6.5 _COBRA Coverage_. BH Media shall assign its group health, dental, vision,
and wellness plans at Closing, and therefore, Buyer agrees it will provide
and  be responsible for the provision of group health, dental, vision, and
wellness plan continuation coverage with respect to each Person who is an "MandA
Qualified Beneficiary" of BH Media (within  the meaning of T. Regs.
54.4980B-9 QandA-4).

 

 

6.6 _General_. Nothing in this _Article 6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed as  conferring any legal rights upon any Person for
continuation of employment by Buyer or its Affiliates, requiring Buyer to
implement, or limiting the rights of Buyer to amend or discontinue, any
benefit plan, program or practice of any nature  whatsoever, or (iii)
conferring upon any Person (other than a Party to this Agreement) any rights
or remedies under this Agreement (including under this _Article 6_ ).

Transactions; provided, however, that, representations and warranties that are
made as of a particular date or period shall be true and correct only as of
such date or  period, and Seller Entities shall have received a certificate
to such effect, signed on behalf of Buyer by an authorized officer.

ARTICLE 8 TERMINATION

 

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:

 

 

(a) by written consent of Seller Entities and Buyer;

 

 

(b) by any Seller Entity or Buyer if any Governmental Entity shall have issued
an order, decree or ruling permanently enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Contemplated  Transactions and such order, decree or
ruling shall have become final and nonappealable (but only if the Party
seeking to terminate pursuant to this clause (b) shall have used best efforts
to oppose and remove such order, decree or ruling);

 

 

(c) by either Seller Entity or Buyer if the  Closing has not occurred (other
than through the failure of any Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before April 30,
2020 (the " _End Date_ ");

 

 

(d) by either Seller Entity, if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform
in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_
_7.3(a)_ or _Section_ _7.3(b)_ that cannot be cured by the End Date, 
provided that the applicable Seller Entity shall have given Buyer written
notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination,

and _Article           9_. If this Agreement is terminated, the

ARTICLE 9 GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

 

9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, and all representations and
warranties  contained in the certificates delivered pursuant to this
Agreement will terminate at the Closing; provided, that, the representations
and warranties of Seller Entities contained in _Section_ _3.1(b)_   and

by notice from such Party) or  sent by email (with an acknowledged response)
to the email addresses set forth on _Schedule 9.2_.

 

 

9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section of, or an Exhibit
or  Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the  word "include," "includes" or "including" is used in
this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 

 

 

19  

9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall  become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and
delivered to each other Party. Such counterparts may be delivered in PDF
format by email correspondence.

 

 

9.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
other agreements referred to in this  Agreement constitute the entire
agreement (and supersede each prior agreement and understanding, whether
written or oral) among the Parties regarding the subject  matter of this
Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or remedies on
any Person other than the Parties.

 

 

9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by; and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of  Delaware regardless of any Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

 

9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation
under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of 
law or otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; provided that prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may elect to assign
its rights under this Agreement to (x) a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer if
such Subsidiary  becomes a party to this Agreement by a duly-executed
amendment to this Agreement and agrees to be bound by the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement and Buyer remains 
responsible and liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement and
guarantees such Subsidiary's obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

9.8 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
by written agreement of the  Parties. No breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty made in this Agreement shall be deemed waived
unless expressly waived in writing by the Party who might assert such breach.

 

 

9.9 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
terms  or were otherwise breached. Each Party shall be entitled to injunctive
relief to prevent any breach of this Agreement and to enforce this Agreement
specifically in any court of the State of Delaware or any court of the United
States located in the  State of Delaware (in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party is entitled at law or in equity). In addition, each Party:

 

 

(a) submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of (i) the courts of the State
of Delaware; and (ii) the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware  with respect to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions to the extent such courts would have subject matter
jurisdiction with respect to such dispute;

 

 

(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such
court; and

 

 

(c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, or the Contemplated Transactions in any court other than
such  courts referred to above.

 

 

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives all right
to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, the Contemplated Transaction or the actions of any Party
in the negotiation, performance or enforcement of  this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the Contemplated Transaction.

 

 

9.11 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that money
damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by
the  another Party, that the Parties would suffer irreparable harm as a
result of any such breach, and that, in addition to all other remedies
available under this Agreement or at law or in equity, the Parties shall be
entitled to specific performance  and injunctive or other equitable relief as
a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. In the event of any action
by any Party to enforce this Agreement, the other Parties hereto hereby waive
the defense that there is an adequate remedy at  law. The Parties recognize
and agree that Seller Entities and Buyer have each relied on this Agreement
and expended considerable effort and resources related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, that the right and benefits conferred upon Seller 
Entities and Buyer herein are unique, and that damages may not be adequate to
compensate Seller Entities or Buyer in the event either refuses to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and effect the Closing in accordance with
the terms and  conditions hereof. The Parties therefore acknowledge and agree
that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to any
and all remedies available to them, Seller Entities shall be entitled to
enforce specifically Buyer's  obligation to purchase the Acquired Assets and
the Buffalo Shares for the Purchase Price and assume the Assumed Liabilities
and otherwise to effect the Closing, if the conditions set forth in _Section_
_7.2_ are satisfied or capable of being satisfied.

 

 

 

20  

9.12 _BH Media 's Retention of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 

 

(a) _Buyer 's Non-Access to BH Media's Records Regarding the Contemplated
Transactions_. Buyer agrees that it would be impractical to remove (and after
Closing  neither Buyer nor, its Affiliates are obligated to remove) all
Attorney-Client Communications from the records (including e-mails and other
electronic files) included in the Acquired Assets. Accordingly, Buyer will
not, and will cause each of its  Affiliates not to, intentionally use any
Attorney-Client Communication in the records of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries after Closing in a manner that Buyer knows or should reasonably
be expected to know is materially adverse to any Seller  Entity.

 

 

(b) _Retention of Privilege_. Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its current and future Affiliates, that from and after Closing (i) the 
attorney-client privilege, all other evidentiary privileges, and the
expectation of client confidence as to all Attorney-Client Communications
belong to BH Media and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer any of its
Affiliates, and (ii) BH Media  will have the exclusive right to control,
assert, or waive the attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary
privilege, and the expectation of client confidence with respect to such
Attorney-Client Communications. Accordingly, after Closing,  Buyer will not,
and will cause each of its Affiliates not to, (A) assert any attorney-client
privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or expectation of client confidence
with respect to any Attorney-Client Communication, except to the extent 
determined necessary by Buyer to be required to fulfill Buyer's obligations
under _Section_ _5.9_ of this Agreement; or (B) knowingly take any action
which could cause any  Attorney-Client Communication to cease being a
confidential communication or to otherwise lose protection under the attorney-
client privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including waiving such
protection in any dispute with a Person that is  not a Seller Entity.

 

 

9.13 _Severability_. Each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted so
as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision is
held  invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not
affect any other provision, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and
enforced in such jurisdiction  as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been included in this Agreement.
