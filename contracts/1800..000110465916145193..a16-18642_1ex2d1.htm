Entities) and its and their respective employees, accountants and other
representatives to, each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm

work papers, as may be reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm
to fulfill its obligations under _Section 2.6(c)_; _provided_ , that the
accountants of Seller or Purchaser shall not be obliged to make any work
papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in accordance with
such accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such
Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator.

 



 

(e) The process set forth in _Section 2.5_ and this _Section 2.6_ shall be

amounts on which they are based or set forth in the related statements and
notices delivered in connection therewith.

Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount,

 



      
 

 



 

then Seller (or an Affiliate designated by Seller) shall pay in cash to
Purchaser the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any
such payment pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ shall be made within ten (10)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Working Capital and

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 



 

Except as set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in, (a) the
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by Seller
with, or furnished to, the SEC and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement, _provided_ that in no event shall any risk factor disclosure,
"forward looking statements" disclosure or other similar general cautionary
statements be deemed to be an exception to or disclosure for purposes of any
representations and warranties contained in this _Article III_, or (b)
subject to _Section 11.1(c)_, the disclosure schedule delivered to Purchaser
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_
"), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows (it being
understood that for purposes of Sellers representations and warranties, the
Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be deemed to have been completed prior to the
date hereof):

 



 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Seller and each
Transferred Entity is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. Each
Transferred Entity has all requisite corporate or other organizational power
and authority to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or
other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, in each case except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a
list of each Transferred Entity, its jurisdiction of organization and the
holders of the shares of its capital stock and, if applicable, other equity
interests.

 



 

3.2 _Capitalization of the Transferred_ _Entities_.

 



 

(a) The Shares and the shares of capital stock and other equity interests of
each Transferred Entity are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and owned by Seller or another Transferred Entity, free and
clear of all Liens other than transfer restrictions imposed by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except for the Shares and any interest held by a Transferred Entity, there
are no shares of common stock, preferred stock or other equity interests of
any Transferred Entity issued and outstanding, and there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, subscriptions, options, warrants, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, convertible, exercisable, or
exchangeable securities or other ownership interest in any Transferred Entity
or any other securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any
securities of any Transferred Entity, and no securities evidencing such rights
are authorized, issued or outstanding. None of the Transferred Entities has
any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations that provide the
holders thereof the right to vote (or are convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
such Transferred Entity on any matter.

 



 

3.3 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Seller has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Seller, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser, constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement when
executed and delivered by the member of the Seller Group party thereto, and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of such Ancillary
Agreement by Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate party thereto, will
constitute, a valid, legal and binding agreement of the applicable members of
the Seller Group, enforceable against such member in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

 



 

3.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. No filing with or notice to, and
no permit, authorization, registration, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity is required on the part of Seller for the execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of
the HSR Act and any applicable non-U.S. Competition Laws; (b) as may be
necessary as a result of any facts or circumstances solely relating to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (c) any such filings, notices, permits,
authorizations, registrations, consents or approvals, the failure to make or
obtain would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect or would not be materially
adverse to the ability of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Assuming compliance with the
items described in clauses (a) through (c) of the preceding sentence, neither
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement by Seller nor the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach,
violation or infringement of any provision of the respective articles of
incorporation or by-laws (or similar governing documents) of Seller or any
Transferred Entity, (ii) result in a breach, violation or infringement of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to the creation of any Lien, except for Permitted Liens, or any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration)

 



      
 

 



 

under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Business Material
Contract, or (iii) violate any Law applicable to any Transferred Entity or any
of their respective properties or assets, except, in the case of clause (ii)
or clause (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or

3.7 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (a) there is no Action

or any of its Affiliates, including the Business Owned Real Property and the
Business Leased Real Property.

 



 

(b) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1_ shall not require the

requirement or request, as applicable, and the extent of the required or
requested disclosure, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Purchaser to preserve to the extent reasonably practicable the
confidentiality of such information.

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and

Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws) required to be
obtained or made by Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
in connection with the Sale, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Sale and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Seller and Purchaser
shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to fulfill
all conditions precedent to this Agreement and shall not take any action after
the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any consent,

 



       
 

 



 

clearance, expiration or termination of a waiting period, authorization, Order
or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity necessary to be
obtained at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
Purchaser and Seller shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Sale and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or
any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity. Purchaser and Seller shall
coordinate with respect to the overall strategy relating to Competition Laws,
including with respect to any filings, notifications, submissions and
communications with or to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser shall make the final determination as to the appropriate course
of action. In that regard, prior to the Closing, subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, each party shall promptly consult with the other party to this
Agreement to provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the
case of correspondence, provide the other party (or its counsel) copies of)
all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Sale. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other
party to this Agreement, and in the case of written communication, furnish the
other party with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
other party orally of) any communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding the Sale, and permit the other party to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed written or (to the extent reasonably practicable) oral
communication or submission with or to any such Governmental Entity. If any
party to this Agreement or any representative of such party receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Sale, then such party will make, or cause to be
made, promptly and after consultation with the other party to this Agreement,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither party shall
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement or the Sale, or with any other Person in connection with any
proceeding or Action by such Person relating to the HSR Act or any other
Competition Laws in connection with this Agreement or the Sale, or make oral
submissions at meetings or, to the extent reasonably practicable, in telephone
or other conversations, unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law, each party shall furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, submissions and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity or
other such Person with respect to this Agreement and the Sale, and furnish the
other party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Entity or other such Person. Purchaser and Seller may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other party under this Agreement as "outside counsel/corporate
in-house antitrust counsel only." Such designated materials and any materials
provided by Purchaser to Seller or by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 5.3_, and the information contained therein, shall be given only to
the outside legal

 



      
 

 



 

counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel of the recipient and shall
not be disclosed by such outside counsel and corporate in-house antitrust
counsel to employees (other than corporate in-house antitrust counsel),
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel; it being understood that materials provided
pursuant to this Agreement may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall file, as promptly as practicable, but in any
event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement (unless Purchaser and Seller mutually agree to a later filing date),
notifications under the HSR Act, and Purchaser and Seller shall file, as
promptly as practicable, any other filings and/or notifications under
applicable Competition Laws. In the event that the parties receive a request
for additional information or documentary materials after an initial
notification pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition Laws, the
parties shall use their respective best efforts to certify compliance with
such requests, as applicable, at the earliest practicable and advisable date
and produce documents on a rolling basis, and counsel for both parties will
closely cooperate during the entirety of any such investigatory or review
process.

 



 

(d) Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Sale under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, or any
other United States federal or state or foreign or supranational Laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or lessening of competition through merger
or acquisition or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Competition Laws_ ").
In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the Sale as violative of any Competition Laws,
Purchaser and Seller shall jointly (to the extent practicable) use their best
efforts to initiate and/or participate in any proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, in order to (i) oppose or defend against any Action by any
Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Sale and/or
(ii) take such action as necessary to overturn any regulatory Action by any
Governmental Entity to block consummation of the Sale, including by defending
any such Action brought by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if
necessary, any Order that makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the
Sale resulting from any such Action.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Competition Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate Order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser,
and their respective Affiliates, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that after the Closing would limit Purchasers, the Transferred
Entities or their respective Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of the
Transferred Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates. In that
regard Purchaser shall

 



      
 

 



 

and, if requested by Purchaser, Seller shall (but, subject to Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement, including this _Section 5.3_, if not so
requested by Purchaser shall not), agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or Purchasers, Sellers, or their
respective Affiliates ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, or any of their respective
Affiliates. All such efforts by Purchaser shall be unconditional, and no
actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Business Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or may occur. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be obligated to take or agree or commit to
take any action described in clause (i) or (ii) of this _Section 5.3(e)_ (A)

be released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of, or otherwise

all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates under each of the

for Seller and its Affiliates (or for which Seller and its Affiliates are not
released) effective as of the Closing and that cannot otherwise be terminated
effective as of the Closing (with Seller and its Affiliates to be released in
respect thereof), Purchaser shall continue to use its commercially reasonable
efforts and shall cause the Transferred Entities to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such substitution or termination and release
after the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates shall extend or renew any Contract containing or underlying
a Substituted Guarantee unless, prior to or concurrently with such extension
or renewal, Purchaser or the Transferred Entities are substituted in all
respects for Seller and any of its Affiliates, and Seller and its Affiliates
are released, in respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its
Affiliates under such Substituted Guarantee.

Agreement, with a list of all surety bonds, letters of credit and letters of
comfort and (ii) within 75 days after the date of this Agreement, with a list

Entities (" _Transferred Entity Insurance Policies_ ")) or by any of the
current and historical self-insured programs of Seller or its Affiliates, and

shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in any insurance
policies or programs or self-insured programs (other than Transferred Entity

rights to proceeds). Seller or any of its Affiliates may, to be effective at

manner they deem appropriate to give effect to this _Section 5.10_. From and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing all insurance
it considers appropriate for its operation of the Transferred Entities and the
Business. At the Closing, Purchaser agrees to take over and assume all the
known and incurred but not reported claims of the Transferred Entities and the
Business (other than the Retained Liabilities) and Purchaser agrees to be
responsible to pay such claims until they are finally settled and disclosed.
Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise
any rights or claims of any Transferred Entity or the Business under or in
respect of any past or current insurance policy,

 



      
 

 



 

program or self-insurance program under which any Transferred Entity or
Affiliate thereof or the Business is a named insured, other than under or in
respect of any Transferred Entity Insurance Policy. Purchaser acknowledges
that the Transferred Entities have obligations (including in respect of
insurance matters) under the agreements set forth in _Section 5.10 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_, and that the Transferred Entities shall continue
to retain such obligations following the Closing.

any litigation or similar dispute between the parties or (v) reasonably be
expected to result in the loss or waiver of the protection of any attorney-
client privilege, attorney work product or other legal privilege (in which
case, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
result in a loss or waiver of privilege).

 



 

(c) Except for Tax Returns and other documents governed by _Section 7.7(c)_,
Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of each Transferred Entity
or the Business existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose of
any thereof for a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date or such
longer time as may be required by Law.

 



 

(d) Paper copies of tangible embodiments of any books and records of the
Business stored as of the Closing in any facilities of Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) or in any third party records
storage facility pursuant to an arrangement with a member of the Seller Group
(" _Archived Records_ ") shall, subject to this _Section 5.15(d)_, remain in
such facility, or a successor thereto, until the earlier of the transfer or
destruction of such Archived Records in accordance with the processes and
procedures set forth on _Section 5.15(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the obligations of the parties under any other provision
of this Agreement, from and after the Closing, the parties shall reasonably
cooperate with each other in the investigation, prosecution or defense of any
Action (other than Actions with respect to Taxes, which are governed by
Article VII) prior to or after the Closing arising from or related to the
operation or conduct of the Business, the ownership, assets or Liabilities of
the Transferred Entities and, in each case, involving one or more third
parties. Such cooperation shall include, upon reasonable advance notice, (i)
providing, and causing their respective Affiliates to provide, documentary or
other evidence, (ii) implementing, and causing their respective Affiliates to
implement, record retention, litigation hold or other documentary or evidence
policies or (iii) making, and causing their respective Affiliates to make,
available directors, officers and employees to give depositions or testimony,
all as reasonably requested by the requesting party from time to time. Except
as otherwise provided in _Article X_, the party requesting such cooperation
shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) by the party
(or Affiliate thereof, as the case may be) providing such cooperation and by
its officers, directors, employees and agents, but not including reimbursing
such party (or Affiliate thereof, as the case may be) or its officers,
directors, employees and agents for their time spent in such cooperation.

 



 

(f) If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset not primarily
related to or primarily used in the Business is found to have been transferred
to Purchaser in error, either directly or indirectly, Purchaser shall
transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
to transfer, at no cost to Purchaser or its Affiliates, such right, property
or asset (and any related liability) as soon as reasonably practicable to
Seller or its Affiliates as directed in writing by Seller. If, following the
Closing, any right, property or asset primarily

 



      
 

 



 

related to or primarily used in the Business is found to have been retained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in error, either directly or indirectly,
Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to transfer, at no cost
to Purchaser, such right, property or asset (and any related liability) as
soon as reasonably practicable to Purchaser or its designated Affiliate as
directed in writing by Purchaser.

 



 

ARTICLE VI

 



 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS COVENANTS

 



 

6.1 _Transfer of Employees_.

 



 

(a) _Transfer of Business Employees Generally_. On or prior to the Closing,
Seller and its Affiliates shall take such steps as are required to (i)
transfer the employment of each Business Employee (other than a TUD Employee
or an Offer Employee) to a Transferred Entity and (ii) transfer the employment
of each employee who is not a Business Employee from a Transferred Entity to a
member of the Seller Group.

 



 

(b) _TUD Employees_. With respect to each Business Employee who is not
employed by a Transferred Entity and is employed in a jurisdiction in which
the Transfer of Undertakings Directive has been implemented (a " _TUD
Employee_ "), Seller and Purchaser accept and agree that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a relevant transfer for purposes of
the Transfer of Undertakings Directive and to apply the Transfer of
Undertakings Directive in all of its provisions, and accept and agree that the
terms and conditions of employment of each such TUD Employee will transfer
effective as of the Closing as if such terms and conditions were originally
made or agreed between Purchaser and the applicable TUD Employee. Seller and
Purchaser shall inform and consult with any appropriate representatives of the
TUD Employees to the extent required by the Transfer of Undertakings Directive
or other applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Offers to Certain Business Employees_. No later than thirty (30) days
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, make a written offer of employment, on terms and conditions
consistent with the requirements of this _Article VI_ and applicable Law, to
each Business Employee who is not employed by a Transferred Entity and does
not become a Transferred Employee pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ (an " _Offer
Employee_ "). Each such offer shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(d) _Delayed Transfer Employees_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of any Business Employee whose employment cannot be transferred at the Closing
or whose employment is delayed or does not transfer at the Closing as a result
of providing transition services or otherwise (a " _Delayed Transfer Employee_
"), Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to cause the employment
of such Delayed Transfer Employee to transfer as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing in such a manner that to the maximum extent
possible does not trigger the right of the employee to separation pay. Any
such Delayed Transfer Employee shall transfer and be employed pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this _Article VI_

 



      
 

 



 

and applicable Law and shall be considered a Transferred Employee for purposes
of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) any U.S. Business
Employee whose employment transfers pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall be
referred to as a " _U.S. Transferred Employee_ " and (ii) any International
Business Employee whose employment transfers pursuant to this _Section 6.1_
shall be referred to as an " _International Transferred Employee_ "
(collectively, the " _Transferred Employees_ ").

 



 

6.2 _Compensation and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits Comparability_. For a period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2018, or such longer period as
required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to each Transferred Employee during his or her employment with
Purchaser and its Affiliates (and, with respect to any compensation or
benefits that apply following a termination of employment, the applicable
period thereafter) (i) base salary or wage rates that are not less than those
in effect for each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to Closing,
(ii) equity and cash incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case,
are no less favorable than those in effect for each such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to Closing (excluding for this purpose any one-time or
otherwise special or non-ordinary course incentive compensation
opportunities), (iii) employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension
benefits) that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those in effect
for each such Business Employee immediately prior to Closing, (iv) defined
benefit pension benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates, and (v)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the greater of (A) the
severance benefits that would have been payable to each such Transferred
Employee under the Seller Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee
participated or was eligible for benefits immediately prior to the Closing,
and (B) the severance benefits applicable to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), taking into
account such Transferred Employees additional period of service and increases
(but not decreases) in compensation following the Closing.

 



 

(b) _Severance or Other Termination Liabilities_.

 



 

(i) The Seller Group and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be equally (on a
50/50 basis) responsible for any severance, redundancy or similar termination
payments or benefits that become payable to any Business Employee arising out
of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any amounts paid or payable to any Business Employee who does not
become an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates because such Business
Employee rejects an offer of employment or transfer of employment or refuses
to transfer employment or does not accept an offer of employment or offer to
transfer employment or otherwise challenges such transfer of employment
pursuant to _Section 6.1_ (such Liabilities, including the employer portion
of any employment Taxes attributable thereto, collectively referred to

 



      
 

 



 

herein as the " _Employee Transaction Liabilities_ "). Any Liabilities that
arise under circumstances related to Purchasers failure to comply with this
Agreement, and any Liabilities that arise as a result of actions taken by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect of the Business or a Transferred
Employee on or following the Closing Date, shall not be considered an Employee
Transaction Liability subject to the cost sharing of the first sentence hereof
and shall be the sole Liability of Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 



 

(ii) The Seller Group and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cooperate to take
commercially reasonable steps to reduce, to the extent possible, the
likelihood that Employee Transaction Liabilities will become payable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Seller Group be obligated to
retain a Business Employee following the Closing.

 



 

(iii) If the Seller Group or Purchaser or its Affiliates become liable for, or
are legally required to make, or make a payment, that constitutes a Liability
that is to be borne (in full or in part) by the other Person under _Section
6.2(b)(i)_, the Person that does not directly incur such Liability shall
reimburse the Person incurring the Liability as soon as practicable but in any
event within thirty (30) days of receipt from the other Person of appropriate
verification, for all payments, costs and expenses actually incurred by such
Person.

 



 

(c) _Service Credit_. For all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Transferred
Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective predecessors before the Closing, to the same
extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any similar Seller Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan (except for
any Transferred Pension Plan Employees or as otherwise required by applicable
Law), post-employment medical or welfare plans or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Transferred Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to
a Seller Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated
immediately before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_
").

 



 

(d) _Welfare Plans_. Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall be responsible
for (i) with respect to the Transferred Entity Benefit Plans, all Liabilities
related to welfare benefit claims of Transferred Employees, Former Business
Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) with respect to Seller
Benefit Plans that are not Transferred Entity Benefit Plans, all Liabilities
related to welfare benefit claims incurred following the Closing by
Transferred

 



      
 

 



 

Employees, Former Business Employees and their eligible dependents. The Seller
Group shall be responsible for all Liabilities related to welfare benefit
claims incurred as of the Closing under the Seller Benefit Plans that are not
Transferred Entity Benefit Plans. Any Former Business Employee who has
experienced a qualifying event under the U.S. Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as codified at Section 601 _et seq_. of ERISA and
at Section 4980B of the Code (" _COBRA_ ") and his or her dependents who are
receiving benefits pursuant to COBRA under a Seller Benefit Plan that is not a
Transferred Entity Benefit Plan as of the Closing shall be permitted to
continue receiving benefits pursuant to COBRA under such Seller Benefit Plan
following the Closing. For purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee,
Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable Seller Benefit Plans in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 



 

(e) _Incentive Compensation_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, continue each performance period in effect at the Closing under each
annual or short-term incentive compensation bonus plan in which any
Transferred Employee participates, with appropriate adjustment (as mutually
determined by Purchaser and Seller) to the applicable performance targets to
take into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make such bonus payments, to the
extent unpaid as of the Closing Date, at the time prescribed by the applicable
plan as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and in accordance with the
historical past practices under such plan as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing.

 



 

(f) _Vacation and Paid Leave_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates, to assume and honor all accrued but unused
vacation and other paid time-off of the Transferred Employees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if Seller and its Affiliates is required under applicable Law to
make a payment in settlement of accrued vacation or paid time off of any
Transferred Employee, Purchaser shall make or reimburse and hold harmless the
Seller Group for such payment.

 



 

(g) _Seller Benefit Plans Other than Transferred Entity Benefit Plans_. From
and after the Closing (or, if later, the time a Delayed Transfer Employees
employment transfers to Purchaser or its Affiliates), the Transferred
Employees shall cease to be active participants in the Seller Benefit Plans
that are not Transferred Entity Benefit Plans.

 



 

6.3 _Transferred Entity Benefit Plans_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
assume all assets and Liabilities related to all Transferred Entity Benefit
Plans.

 



      
 

 



 

6.4 _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall, with respect to any
Transferred Employee whose defined benefit pension obligation in one or more
of the defined benefit pension plans maintained by the Seller Group is
required to be assumed or retained by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) under applicable Law as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transferor Pension Plans_
"), establish or designate defined benefit pension plans (collectively, the "
_Transferee Pension Plans_ ") for the benefit of such Transferred Employees.
The Transferred Employees whose defined benefit pension obligation is required
to be assumed or retained by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) are referred to hereinafter as the " _Transferred
Pension Plan Employees_." The Transferred Pension Plan Employees shall be
given credit under the respective Transferee Pension Plan for all service with
and compensation from Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
predecessors as if it were service with and compensation from Purchaser or its
Affiliates for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of
any benefits or benefit accruals under each respective Transferee Pension
Plan. Each Transferee Pension Plan shall provide, upon the transfer of assets
referred to below (or, if there is no transfer of assets with respect to a
particular plan because the plan is not funded, as of the Closing), that the
accrued benefits for the Transferred Pension Plan Employees under such
Transferee Pension Plan shall in no event be less than their accrued benefits
under the corresponding Transferor Pension Plan as of the Closing.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Transferor Pension Plan that is funded (other than any
Transferor Pension Plan maintained in Germany), Seller shall cause to be
transferred from the trusts (or in the case of other funding vehicles,
transferred from such funding vehicles) under such Transferor Pension Plan to
the trusts or other funding vehicles under the corresponding Transferee
Pension Plan assets in the form of cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities or insurance contracts (to the extent allowable under the terms of
such contracts and exclusively intended to cover plan benefits), the value of
which shall be equal to: (x) the actuarial present value of accumulated
benefits (that is, the "accumulated benefit obligation" as defined in Topic
715 in the FASBs Accounting Standards Codification, " _ABO_ ") under such
Transferor Pension Plan as of the Closing that are attributable to the
Transferred Pension Plan Employees divided by the ABO of all participants in
such Transferor Pension Plan as of the Closing, multiplied by the market value
of the assets of such Transferor Pension Plan at the Closing, provided that
such transferred amount shall not, in any event, exceed the ABO under such
Transferor Pension Plan of all Transferred Pension Plan Employees as of the
date of Closing or (y) such greater amount as is required by applicable Law or
the applicable Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Transferor
Pension Plan in order to obtain approval for the transfer.

 



 

(c) The amounts determined in accordance with _Section 6.4(b)_ are
collectively referred to as the " _Pension Transfer Amounts_ ". The transfer
of the Pension Transfer Amounts, and the assumption by Purchaser and its
Affiliates of Liabilities with respect to or relating to the Transferred
Pension Plan Employees under the applicable Transferor Pension Plans, shall be
subject to such consents and other requirements as may apply under applicable
Law, including the consent of the Transferred Pension Plan Employees to the
extent required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall cause the corresponding
Transferee Pension Plans to accept the Pension Transfer Amounts. To the extent
a Transferor Pension Plan is not required to be funded by applicable Law and
is not voluntarily funded as of the Closing, there shall be no transfer of

 



       
 

 



 

assets by the Transferor Pension Plan or by Seller or its Affiliates.
Actuarial determinations shall be made in accordance with _Section 6.4(g) _
below.

 



 

(d) As of the Closing, Seller shall cause the Transferred Employees to cease
further accrual of benefits under the pension plans sponsored by the Seller
Group.

 



 

(e) The Pension Transfer Amount, if any, from each Transferor Pension Plan
and, if applicable, the corresponding benefit accruals Purchaser is obligated
to assume shall be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit payments
made from the Transferor Pension Plan to the Transferred Pension Plan
Employees after the Closing but prior to the date of transfer and for any
earnings and losses on such amount during such period. The Pension Transfer
Amount, if any, shall be determined pursuant to _Section 6.4(g)_ below.

 



 

(f) At the times of the transfers of the Pension Transfer Amounts, Purchaser
and the Transferee Pension Plans shall assume all Liabilities for all accrued
benefits, including all disability, part-time, early retirement and other
ancillary benefits, under the corresponding Transferor Pension Plans in
respect of the Transferred Pension Plan Employees whose benefits are
transferred, and the Seller Group and the corresponding Transferor Pension
Plans shall be relieved of all Liabilities to provide benefits under the
Transferor Pension Plans to the Transferred Pension Plan Employees whose
benefits are transferred. From and after the date of such applicable transfer
of the Pension Transfer Amounts (or if there is no transfer of assets with
respect to a particular plan because the plan is not required to be funded
under applicable Law and is not voluntarily funded as of the Closing, from and
after the Closing), Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Group and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any
and all costs, damages, losses, expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of
or related to the benefits of the Transferred Pension Plan Employees that are
transferred to the Transferee Pension Plans, or the transfer of benefits,
assets and Liabilities pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, or the cessation of
participation in the Transferor Pension Plans in connection therewith.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this _Section 6.4_, actuarial determinations shall be
based upon the actuarial assumptions and methodologies used in preparing the
most recent audited financial statements of Seller as of the date of the
determination. The applicable plan sponsor of the Transferor Pension Plans
shall cause the plan actuary or administrator to provide a report of its
determination of such amount within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date and
any back-up information reasonably required by Purchaser to confirm the
accuracy of such determination. If Purchaser disputes the accuracy of the
calculation, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to identify the basis for
such disagreement and act in good faith to resolve such dispute. To the extent
that a dispute is unresolved after a forty-five (45) day period following
identification of such dispute, the calculations shall be verified by an
independent third party benefits consulting firm selected by the mutual
agreement of Seller and Purchaser. The decision of such consulting firm shall
be final, binding and conclusive on Seller and Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser
shall share equally the costs of such consulting firm.

 



      
 

 



 

6.5 _U.S. Defined Contribution Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall create or designate defined
contribution pension plans (collectively, the " _Purchaser DC Plans_ ") for
the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in one or more
of the defined contribution pension plans maintained by the Seller Group that
are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code immediately
prior to the Closing or the corresponding provisions of the Puerto Rico
Internal Revenue Code (collectively, the " _Seller DC Plans_ "). Such U.S.
Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _U.S. DC
Employees_." The U.S. DC Employees shall be given credit under the respective
Purchaser DC Plan for all service with and compensation from Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective predecessors as if it were service with and
compensation from Purchaser for purposes of determining eligibility and
vesting under each respective Purchaser DC Plan. The applicable Purchaser DC
Plans shall be tax-qualified in the same manner as the corresponding Seller DC
Plans, and Purchaser shall provide Seller any determination letters or similar
documentation evidencing such qualification.

 



 

(b) Each Purchaser DC Plan will provide for the receipt in kind from the U.S.
DC Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined
under Section 402 of the Code or any equivalent term under the Puerto Rico
Internal Revenue Code), including notes corresponding to loans. Purchaser and
Seller will work together in order to facilitate any such distribution or
rollover and to effect an eligible rollover distribution for those DC
Employees who elect to rollover their account balances, including notes,
directly into a Purchaser DC Plan.

 



 

6.6 _International Defined Contribution Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall establish or designate
defined contribution plans (collectively, the " _International Purchaser DC
Plans_ ") for the benefit of the International Transferred Employees who
participated in one or more of the defined contribution plans maintained by
the Seller Group immediately prior to the Closing outside the United States
(collectively, the " _International Seller DC Plans_ "). Such International
Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _International DC
Employees_." The International DC Employees shall be given credit under the
respective International Purchaser DC Plan for all service with and
compensation from Seller and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors
as if it were service with and compensation from Purchaser for purposes of
determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of any benefits or benefit
accruals under each respective International Purchaser DC Plan. The applicable
Purchaser International DC Plans shall be tax-qualified in the same manner as
the corresponding Seller International DC Plans, and Purchaser shall provide
Seller any determination letters or similar documentation evidencing such
qualification.

 



 

(b) With respect to an International Seller DC Plan, Seller shall cause the
transfer under each such International Seller DC Plan to the corresponding
International Purchaser DC Plan of (i) cash, cash equivalents or other
property equal to the actual account balances of the International DC
Employees under each such International Seller DC Plan as of the Closing or
such greater amount as is required by the applicable regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over the International Seller DC Plan in order to obtain
approval of such transfer, and (ii) any notes corresponding to loans of the
International DC Employees (collectively, the " _DC Transfer Amounts_ "). The
transfer of the DC Transfer Amounts shall be subject to such consents,
approvals and other legal requirements as may apply under applicable Law.
Purchaser shall cause the DC Transfer Amounts to be accepted by such plans. To
the extent an International

 



      
 

 



 

Seller DC Plan is not required to be funded by applicable Law and is not
voluntarily funded as of the Closing, there shall be no transfer of assets.

 



 

(c) The DC Transfer Amounts to be transferred, if any, from the respective
International Seller DC Plans and the corresponding benefit accrual Purchaser
is required to assume shall be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit
payments made from the respective International Seller DC Plans to the
International DC Employees after the Closing but prior to the date of transfer
and for any earnings and losses on such amount during such period. The
transfer of the DC Transfer Amount, if any, shall take place within one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of Closing.

 



 

(d) At the times of the transfers of the DC Transfer Amounts (or if there is
no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because the plan is
not required to be funded under applicable Law, at the Closing), Purchaser and
the International Purchaser DC Plans shall assume all Liabilities with respect
to or relating to International Transferred Employees under the applicable
International Seller DC Plan and the Seller Group and the International Seller
DC Plans shall be relieved of all such Liabilities under such International
Seller DC Plan with respect to the International Transferred Employees. From
and after the date of the transfer of the DC Transfer Amount (or if there is
no transfer of assets with respect to a particular plan because the plan is
not required to be funded under applicable Law, as of the Closing), Purchaser
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group and its officers,
directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all costs, damages,
losses, expenses, or other Liabilities arising out of or related to the DC
Transfer Amounts.

 



 

6.7 _Deferred Compensation Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall establish or designate
nonqualified deferred compensation plans (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Deferred Compensation Plans_ ") for the benefit of (i) the U.S. Transferred
Employees who participated in the Abbott Laboratories Deferred Compensation
Plan and (ii) the International Transferred Employees who participated in one
or more of the deferred compensation plans maintained by the Seller Group
immediately prior to the Closing (collectively with the Abbott Laboratories
Deferred Compensation Plan, the " _Seller Deferred Compensation Plans_ ").
Such Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the " _Deferred
Compensation Employees_." The Deferred Compensation Employees shall be given
credit under the respective Purchaser Deferred Compensation Plan for all
service with and compensation from Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective predecessors as if it were service with and compensation from
Purchaser for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and the amount of
any benefits or benefit accruals under each respective Purchaser Deferred
Compensation Plan. The grantor trust, and the assets thereunder, related to
the Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
shall be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and the Purchaser Deferred
Compensation Plans shall assume all Liabilities with respect to or relating to
Deferred Compensation Employees under the applicable Seller Deferred
Compensation Plan, and the Seller Group and the Seller Deferred Compensation
Plans shall be relieved of all such Liabilities under such Seller Deferred
Compensation Plans with respect to the Deferred Compensation

 



      
 

 



 

Employees. From and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Group and its officers, directors, employees, and agents
from and against any and all costs, damages, losses, expenses, or other
Liabilities arising out of or related to the Deferred Compensation Employees
under the applicable Seller Deferred Compensation Plans.

 



 

6.8 _Equity Compensation_.

 



 

(a) Each restricted stock unit in respect of common shares of Seller ("
_Seller Shares_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and
held by a Business Employee (each, a " _Seller RSU_ ") that would otherwise be
forfeited as of the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions
applicable to such Seller RSU immediately prior to Closing shall, as of the
Closing and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a restricted stock unit, with the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Seller RSU immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "
_Purchaser RSU_ "), with respect to the number of common shares of Purchaser
(" _Purchaser Shares_ "), rounded up to the nearest whole share, determined by
multiplying the number of Seller Shares subject to the Seller RSU by the
Exchange Ratio. Any performance goals applicable to an outstanding Seller RSU
shall be deemed satisfied as of the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient of (i) the volume weighted
average per-share price of Seller Shares trading on the New York Stock
Exchange during each of the five (5) full trading days ending two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date divided by (ii) the volume weighted average
per-share price of Purchaser Shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange
during each of the five (5) full trading days ending two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a number of authorized but unissued Purchaser Shares for delivery
upon the settlement of the Purchaser RSUs in accordance with this _Section
6.8_. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in connection with the preparation
of registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the Purchaser Shares subject to such awards, in order to
file such forms effective as of the Closing. In addition, Purchaser shall
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

 



 

6.9 _ESPP_. Effective as of the Closing, each Transferred Employee who
participates in an employee stock purchase plan maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Seller ESPPs_ ") shall
cease participation in the applicable Seller ESPPs and shall have his or her
payroll deductions refunded by Seller or its Affiliates as soon as
administratively practicable in accordance with the terms of the Seller ESPPs.

 



 

6.10 _Labor and Employment Law Matters_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate
to take all steps, on a timely basis, as are required under applicable Law or
any collective bargaining agreement or works council agreement to notify,
consult with, or negotiate the effect, impact, terms or timing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with each works council, union,
labor board, employee group, or Governmental Entity where so required under
applicable Law, including the Transfer of Undertakings Directive. Seller shall
regularly review

 



      
 

 



 

with Purchaser the progress of the notifications, consultations and

_Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each Purchaser Tax Indemnified
Party harmless from and against (a) any Taxes of the Transferred Entities for
any Pre-Closing Period (allocated in respect of a Straddle Period in
accordance with _Section 7.3_); (b) any Taxes of Seller or any other Person
(other than any Transferred Entity) for which any Transferred Entity is or
becomes liable (under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or under any

as a member (or having been required to join as a member) of any consolidated,
combined, affiliated, aggregate or unitary group prior to the Closing; (c) any
Taxes of any Person (other than any Transferred Entity) for which any
Transferred Entity is or becomes liable as a transferee or successor, as a
result of a Contract (other than this Agreement) or otherwise by operation of
Law, in each case, as a result of transactions or events occurring prior to
the Closing; (d) any Taxes arising from any action or transaction undertaken
pursuant to or in connection with _Sections 5.7_ , _5.14_ or _5.15(f)_ ; (e)
any Taxes arising out of or resulting from any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement; and (f) any reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses
attributable to any item described in clauses (a) through (e) of this _Section
7.1_ (any such Taxes described in this _Section 7.1_, " _Excluded Taxes_ ");
_provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to pay or cause to be paid, or
to indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties from and
against any Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section
7.2_.

 



 

7.2 _Tax Indemnification by Purchaser_. Effective as of and after the Closing

7.3 _Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law,
the taxable year of each of the Transferred Entities that begins before and

Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period, and (b) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the
Transferred Entities allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as
if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date and

exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis

between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after
the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period and (b)
any Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any
partnership, controlled foreign corporation or other "flowthrough" entity
shall be computed as if the taxable period of such partnership, controlled
foreign corporation or other "flowthrough" entity ended as of the end of the
day on the Closing Date (whether or not such Taxes arise in a Straddle Period
of the applicable owner).

 



 

7.4 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes any member of the Seller

Combined Tax Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to any of
the Transferred Entities for any taxable period that ends on or before the

file or cause to be timely filed any Combined Tax Return and any Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Return that is required to be filed on or before the Closing Date
(taking into account any extensions). In the case of any such Combined Tax
Return for a Straddle Period and any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return, Seller

due on such Tax Returns, and Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely
filed such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax
Return or any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return (or any notification or election
relating thereto) without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). At Sellers
request, Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, amended Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Returns. Notwithstanding Section 7.7(c), Purchaser shall promptly
provide (or cause to be provided) to

 



      
 

 



 

Seller any information reasonably requested by Seller to facilitate the
preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described in this _Section 7.4(a)_,
and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare (or cause
to be prepared) such information in a manner and on a timeline requested by
Seller, which information and timeline shall be consistent with the past
practice of the Transferred Entities, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared by Seller pursuant to
_Section 7.4(a)_, Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred
Entities. In the case of any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period (a "
_Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall prepare or cause to
be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practices of the
Transferred Entities (or of Seller with respect to the Transferred Entities),
except as required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for
its review and comment a copy of each such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return
at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date thereof (taking into
account any extensions). Purchaser shall revise such Straddle Period Separate
Tax Return to reflect any reasonable comments received from Seller not later
than fifteen (15) days before the due date thereof (taking into account any

Ancillary Agreement, except to the extent such Tax Return relates solely to
the Transferred Entities, (i) Seller shall not be required to provide any

consolidated, combined, affiliated, aggregate or unitary Tax Return (or copy
thereof) that includes Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than any
Transferred Entity).

 



 

7.5 _Certain Tax Benefits, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

 



 

(a) If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Entities) derives a Tax Benefit as a result of any audit
adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) made with respect to
any Tax Item by any taxing authority with respect to Taxes for which Seller is
responsible under Section 7.1, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount
of such Tax Benefit within fifteen (15) days after such Tax Benefit is
realized or utilized; provided, that where such Tax Benefit is reflected on a
Tax Return, such Tax Benefit shall be deemed to be realized or utilized within
fifteen (15) days of filing such Tax Return. Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its relevant Affiliates to, claim any Tax Benefit to which it may be entitled
as a result of any such audit adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax
Proceeding).

 



 

(b) Seller shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit arising from any Tax Item
arising in respect of any payment, loss, obligation, liability or Tax made or
incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing,
the Transferred Entities), or for which Seller

 



      
 

 



 

is responsible under this Agreement (including pursuant to _Article X_) or
otherwise, and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither Purchaser nor
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall claim any such Tax Item on any Tax
Return for a Post-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
Tax Item is not permitted by Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for which
Seller has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ and is
permitted by Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for a Post-Closing Period for
which Purchaser has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_, then
Purchaser shall claim such Tax Item and pay to Seller the amount of any Tax
Benefit resulting from such Tax Item.

 



 

(c) Seller shall be entitled to (i) any refunds or credits of or against any
Taxes for which Seller is responsible under _Section 7.1_, and (ii) any
refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under _Section 7.5(a)_, (b) or
(d). Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any
Taxes other than refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled pursuant to
the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Transferred
Entities for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller
and Purchaser in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 7.3_
and the first two sentences of this _Section 7.5(c)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall (and Seller shall not) be entitled to a refund or
credit (x) to the extent such refund or credit was reflected in, reserved for
or taken into account in the determination of Working Capital or Cash Amounts
on the Final Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statements or (y)
attributable to the carryback of a Subsequent Loss (as defined in Section
7.5(d)) into any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, which
carryback is required by applicable Law, other than with respect to a Tax
Return which includes a member of the Seller Group. Each party actually
receiving or realizing a refund or credit of Taxes to which the other party is
entitled under this _Section 7.5(c) _shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to
pay, to the party so entitled the amount of such refund or credit (including
any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes and other reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses to the party receiving such refund or credit in respect of the
receipt or accrual of such refund or credit) in readily available funds within
fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of the refund or credit or the
application of such refund or credit against amounts otherwise payable. If any
such refund or credit in respect of which a party made a payment to the other
party pursuant to this Section 7.5(c) is subsequently disallowed or reduced,
such other party shall promptly repay the amount of such refund or credit
received, to the extent disallowed or reduced, to the party that made such
payment, together with any interest, penalties or other charges imposed
thereon by the applicable taxing authority.

 



 

(d) Except as required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit of any
Transferred Entity that arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing
Date (a " _Subsequent Loss_ ") into any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date.

 



 

7.6 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
prompt written notice thereof to the other party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure of such party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve
the other party of any of its obligations under this _Article VII_, except to
the extent that the other party is prejudiced by such failure. Such notice
shall specify in

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the taxing authority.

 



 

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Transferred Entities for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing

shall have the exclusive right to control such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall (i) defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in
good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (ii) not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding
without obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such settlement,
compromise or abandonment could have a material adverse impact on Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates for any Post-Closing Period or would reasonably be
expected to materially increase Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible under
Section 7.2,and (iii) permit Purchaser and its representatives, at their sole
cost and expense, to participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend any
meetings or conferences with the relevant taxing authority; provided, further,
however, that any such settlement, compromise or abandonment resulting in the
reduction or elimination of a Tax Asset of a Transferred Entity existing as of
the Closing shall not for this purpose be considered as having a material
adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for any Post-Closing
Period.

 



 

(c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Transferred Entities for any Straddle Period (other than a Tax Proceeding
described in _Section 7.6(d)_), the Controlling Party shall have the right

, _however_ , that (i) the Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling
Party with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax
Proceeding, (ii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling
Party before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (iii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling
Party and offer the Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before

Tax Proceeding, (iv) the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, (v) the Non-Controlling Party shall be
entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding and attend any meetings or
conferences with the relevant taxing authority, and (vi) the Controlling Party
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
, _further_ , _however_ , that the Controlling Party shall not have any
obligations (and the Non-Controlling Party shall not have any rights) under
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) above with respect to any portion of such Tax
Proceeding (and any actions, written materials, meetings or conferences
relating exclusively thereto) that could not reasonably be expected to affect
the liability of, or otherwise have an adverse effect on, the Non-Controlling
Party or any of its Affiliates. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlling
Party_ " shall mean Seller if Seller and its Affiliates are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, or Purchaser if Purchaser and its Affiliates are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax
Proceeding; and " _Non-Controlling Party_ " means whichever of Seller or
Purchaser is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding
with respect to (i) any Tax Return of Seller or a member of the Seller Group;
and (ii) any Tax Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that
includes any member of the Seller Group (including any Combined Tax Return).

that the right to terminate this Agreement under

(ii) Seller (in the case of a termination by Purchaser) or Purchaser (in the
case of a termination by Seller) shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its respective representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and such breach or
failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in _Section 8.2(a)_, _8.2(b)_ , _8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ , as applicable, and
(B) (1) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (2) if
capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured prior to
the date that is sixty (60) days from the date that Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, receives written notice of such alleged breach or failure to
perform from the party seeking termination, stating such partys intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section _ _9.1(b)_ _(ii)_ and the
basis for such termination; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this

_Section 5.3_, with respect to any such Legal Restraint; or

 



 

(iv) any Governmental Entity that must grant a consent, authorization or
approval required by _Section 8.1(a)_ shall have denied such grant, and such
denial shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the right

failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, including _Section 5.3_, with respect
to such consent, authorization or approval.

 



      
 

 



 

9.2 _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1_, written
notice of such termination shall be given by the terminating party to the
other.

 



 

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this
Agreement shall terminate and become void and have no effect, and there shall
be no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement, except as set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any party hereto from liability for willful or
material breach of this Agreement or willful or material failure to perform
its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the provisions of _Section 5.2(a)_, the second
sentence of _Section 5.3(f)_, _Article XI_ (General Provisions), and this

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article X_ and except with respect to

contained in _Article III_ (other than any representation or warranty of

reserved for or taken into account in the determination of Working Capital or
Indebtedness on the Final

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Working Capital and Net Indebtedness Statements or were reflected or
reserved for in the Business Financial Statements; (B) pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i)_, for any claim unless such claim or series of related claims
involve Losses in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _De
Minimis Amount_ ") and if such Losses do not exceed the De Minimis Amount,
such Losses shall not be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating
the aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Losses under
_Section 10.2(b)(i)(C)_; or (C) pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_, until the
aggregate amount of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties Losses under _Section

resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser,
at and as of the Closing as though made at and as of such time (unless made as
of a specific date, in which case at and as of such date), contained in

warranty and any Losses resulting therefrom shall be determined without giving
effect to any limitations or qualifications contained in such representation
or warranty regarding materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect; (b)

10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any pending
or threatened claim or demand asserted, or any other matter or circumstance
that arises, that has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified
Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "); _provided_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article X_ except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3_, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within thirty (30) days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim (at the
expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party if (x) such Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable or non-monetary relief against
the Indemnified Party (other than equitable or non-monetary relief that is
incidental to monetary damages as the primary relief sought), (y) such Third
Party Claim is related to or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal
matter, or (z) the amount of monetary Losses sought in connection with such
Third Party Claim is reasonably likely to exceed the Cap (if applicable) or
the limitation set forth in _Section 10.2(b)(iii)_. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to
this _Section 10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and
control such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own
expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to select counsel,
contractors and consultants, subject to the Indemnified Partys approval, not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser or Seller, as
the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records,
personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a
Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, with the
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that such settlement or
judgment does not involve any injunctive relief or finding or admission of any
violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such
settlement or judgment (subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
X_). No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that such consent is not required if the
judgment, settlement or compromise would not involve any payment by the
Indemnifying Party and pertains to a Third Party Claim of the type set forth
in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 10.4(b).

 



 

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to (i) claims for intentional
fraud with respect to Sellers representations and warranties in this
Agreement (in the case of Liabilities or Losses by Purchaser Indemnified
Parties) or with respect to Purchasers or Parents representations and
warranties in this Agreement (in the case of Liabilities or Losses by Seller
Indemnified Parties) and (ii) the matters covered by _Sections 2.5_ through
_2.7_ and with respect to any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be
governed exclusively by _Article VII_) and except for the parties right to
seek and obtain any equitable relief pursuant to _Section 11.11_, Purchaser
and Seller acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ (and the other
provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that expressly
contemplate indemnification following the Closing) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of Seller and Purchaser for any Liabilities or Losses
(including any Liabilities or Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each
party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of,
or in connection with the Sale or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by
any party, or any failure by any party to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with,
under this Agreement (but excluding the Ancillary Agreements). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and Seller hereby
irrevocably waives any right of rescission it may otherwise have or to which
it may become entitled.

 



 

10.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this _Article X_, all Losses shall be
net of indemnity proceeds that have been recovered by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (it
being agreed that if indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are
recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys
making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent that such proceeds plus the indemnification
payment made exceed the indemnifiable Losses incurred), and the Indemnified
Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to seek recovery under all indemnity provisions covering such Losses
to the same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to
indemnification hereunder.

 



 

10.7 _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party have
liability to any Indemnified Party for, and Losses shall not be deemed to
include, any consequential, special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, punitive
or similar damages, or for any loss of future revenue, profits or income, or
for any diminution in value damages measured as a multiple of earnings,
revenue or any other performance metric, except for any such damages to the
extent actually awarded and paid to a third party. Neither the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, nor the Seller Indemnified Parties, on
the other hand, shall be entitled to recover more than once in respect of any
Loss.

 



       
 

 



 

10.8 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder, and no Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for any Losses to the extent they arise out of or result from
the Indemnified Partys failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate such Losses.

11.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , that no party to this Agreement may
directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or all
of its obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written
consent of the other party to this Agreement, except that (a) Seller may
transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, its rights under
this Agreement to any Affiliate of Seller, but

 



      
 

 



 

any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Seller of any of its
obligations hereunder and (b) Purchaser may transfer or assign, in whole or
from time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, its rights under
this Agreement, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Purchaser
of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Any party to
this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by the
other party to this Agreement with any term or provision of this Agreement on
the part of such other party to this Agreement to be performed or complied
with. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any term or
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 



 

11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

11.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the limitations on remedies of the parties following termination of this
Agreement set forth in _Section 9.3_ shall not limit the right of Seller to
obtain specific performance pursuant to this _Section 11.11_. If, prior to
the Outside Date, any party brings any Action in accordance with _Section
11.3_ to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
(x) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action.

 



      
 

 



 

11.12 _Parent Undertaking_. Parent will cause Purchaser to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Parent hereby
makes the representations and warranties in _Article IV_ of this Agreement,
_mutatis mutandis_ , with respect to its obligations under this _Section
11.12_.

 



 

11.13 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of Attorney-
Client Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Transferred Entities, to waive and not
to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee or
director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated
Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by any
legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz (the " _Current Representation_ ").

 



 

(b) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Transferred Entities, to waive and not
to assert, any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or
protection with respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any
Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in connection
with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with a dispute
with Purchaser or its Affiliates, and following the Closing, with any
Transferred Entity (including in respect of any claim for indemnification by
Purchaser), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights
to such attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or protection and
to control such attorney-client and other applicable legal privilege or
protection shall be retained by Seller and that Seller, and not Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Transferred Entities, shall have the sole right to decide
whether or not to waive any attorney-client or other applicable legal
privilege or protection; _provided_ that any information specifically related
to the Business that is covered by such privilege and any documents containing
advice or communications subject thereto shall be kept confidential by Seller.
Accordingly, from and after Closing, none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or the
Transferred Entities shall have any access to any such communications or to
the files of the Current Representation, all of which shall be and remain the
property of Seller and not of Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred
Entities, or to internal counsel relating to such engagement, and none of
Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Transferred Entities or any Person acting on
their behalf shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that
the privilege and protection attaching to such communications and files
belongs to Seller.

 



 

11.14 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by
Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, in any Action or
proceeding by or on behalf of a third party, that Purchaser, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates, or that such third party or any of its respective
Affiliates, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provisions of any contract.

 



      
 

 



 

11.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic method shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.
