 Stockholder Approvals, an equity incentive plan, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Company, that provides for the issuance of restricted
stock units and other forms of equity incentive awards by the Company subject
to an aggregate cap on such awards equal to the sum of (i) 12% of the number

evergreen for 10 years equal to 5% of the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock outstanding as of the conclusion of Buyer immediately preceding Fiscal

2.6 _Earnout._

 

(a) _Earnout Payments_. After the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Company Stockholders shall have the contingent right to
receive additional shares of Buyer Common Stock from Buyer based on the
performance of Buyer and its Subsidiaries during the Fiscal Year 2019 (the
"2019 Earnout Year") and Fiscal Year 2020 (the "2020 Earnout Year" and
together with the 2019 Earnout Year, each an "Earnout Year" and collectively,
the "Earnout Period") as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ (the
"Earnout Shares"). The aggregate number of Earnout Shares shall depend upon
the Redemption Percentage as set forth in the tables below.

 

(i) In the event that (A) Revenue for Fiscal Year 2019 is equal to or greater
than the product of the Pro forma Revenue multiplied by 1.3 (the "2019
Revenue Target"), and (B) Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year 2019 is equal to or
greater than the product of the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by 1.45
(the "2019 Adjusted EBITDA Target"), the aggregate number of Earnout Shares
to be issued with respect to the 2019 Earnout Year (hereinafter the "2019
Earnout Shares") shall equal the following:



      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

62.50% but 
less than or 
equal to 
75.00% |  |  | Greater than

1,763,633 |  |  |  | 1,563,642 |  |  |  | 1,363,633 | 
 

To the extent that the 2019 Adjusted EBITDA Target is satisfied and Revenue
for Fiscal Year 2019 is at least 80% of the 2019 Revenue Target but less than
the 2019 Revenue Target, then the above-number of aggregate 2019 Earnout
Shares shall be reduced by 0.5% for every 1.0% Revenue for Fiscal Year 2019 is
below the 2019 Revenue Target (for example, if the 2019 Revenue Target is
US$100,000,000, Revenue for Fiscal Year 2019 is US$80,000,000 and the
Redemption Percentage is 100%, the 2019 Earnout Shares shall equal 1,227,270
((x) 1,363,633 multiplied by (y) 90%, rounded up to the nearest whole share)).
Each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive the portion of the
aggregate 2019 Earnout Shares due from Buyer under this _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)(i)_ as set forth on _Schedule III_.

(ii) In the event that (A) Revenue for Fiscal Year 2020 is equal to or
greater than the product of the Revenue for Fiscal Year 2019 multiplied by
1.3 (the "2020 Revenue Target"), and (B) Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year 2020
is equal to or greater than the product of Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year
2019 multiplied by 1.45 (the "2020 Adjusted EBITDA Target"), the aggregate
number of Earnout Shares (hereinafter the "2020 Earnout Shares") shall equal
the following:

 



      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

1,763,639 |  |  |  | 1,563,631 |  |  |  | 1,363,639 | 
 

To the extent that the 2020 Adjusted EBITDA Target has been achieved and
Revenue for Fiscal Year 2020 is at least 80% of the 2020 Revenue Target but
less than the 2020 Revenue Target, then the above-number of aggregate 2020
Earnout Shares shall be reduced by 0.5% for every 1.0% Revenue for Fiscal Year
2020 is below the 2020 Revenue Target (for example, if the 2020
Revenue Target is US$120,000,000, Revenue for Fiscal Year 2020 is
US$102,000,000 and the Redemption Percentage is 75.00%, the 2019 Earnout
Shares shall equal 1,631,361 ((x) 1,763,633 multiplied by (y) 92.5%, rounded
up to the nearest whole share)). Each Company Stockholder shall be entitled
to receive the portion of the aggregate 2020 Earnout Shares due from Buyer
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_ as set forth on _Schedule III_.

 

(iii) If for an Earnout Year, the conditions to the issuance of Earnout Shares
as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_,
as applicable, are not met, no Earnout Shares shall be issued with respect to
such Earnout Year. If for any Earnout Year there is a final determination in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(d)_ that the Company Stockholders are
entitled to receive Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year (or an Acceleration
Event), then such Earnout Shares will be due and issuable upon such final
determination (or Acceleration Event) and within 10 days thereafter Buyer
shall issue and deliver or have its transfer agent issue and deliver to each
Company Stockholder (i) certificates for such Company Stockholders share of
such Earnout Shares, if shares of Buyer Common Stock are represented by
certificates or (ii) such Company Stockholders share of such Earnout Shares
via book-entry issuance.

 

(b) _Earnout Acceleration_. In the event that after the Closing and during the
Earnout Period, (i) there is a Change of Control, (ii) any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Buyer (whether voluntary or involuntary) is
initiated, (iii) any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or similar
proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or
any dissolution or liquidation proceeding, is instituted by or against Buyer,
or a receiver is appointed for Buyer or a substantial part of its assets or
properties, or (iv) Buyer makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
petitions or applies to any Governmental Authority for, or consents or
acquiesces to, the appointment of a custodian, receiver or trustee for all or
substantial part of its assets or properties (each of clauses (i) through
(iv), an "Acceleration Event"), then any Earnout Shares that have not been
issued by Buyer (whether or not previously earned and whether or not any
Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA targets or thresholds have been achieved) shall be
deemed earned and due by Buyer to the Company Stockholders upon such
Acceleration Event. For purposes hereof, a "Change of Control" means the
occurrence in a single transaction or as a result of a series of related
transactions, of one or more of the following events: (i) a merger,
consolidation, reorganization or similar business combination transaction
involving Buyer, immediately after which, either (x) the Board of Directors of
Buyer immediately prior to the merger, consolidation, reorganization
or similar transaction does not constitute at least a majority of the board
of directors of the Person surviving the merger or, if the surviving Person is
a Subsidiary, the ultimate Buyer thereof or (y) the holders of Buyer Common
Stock immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction do not
directly own beneficially or of record immediately upon the consummation of
such transaction outstanding equity interests that represent a majority of the
combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Person
resulting from such merger, consolidation, reorganization or other transaction
or, if the surviving Person is a Subsidiary, the ultimate Buyer thereof; (ii)
a transaction in which a majority of Buyers voting securities are
transferred to any Person, or any two more Persons acting as a group, and

 



16

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 all Affiliates of such Person or Persons (each, a "Group") or (iii) the
consummation of the sale, lease or transfer of a majority of the assets of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person or Group, in each
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), where the value of the aggregate
consideration (whether in cash, securities and/or other property) received by
each holder of Buyer Common Stock with respect to each share of Buyer Common
Stock held by such holder equals at least $10.00 per share of Buyer Common
Stock (subject to appropriate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations and other recapitalizations).

 

(c) _Dividends and Distributions_. Any dividends or distributions declared
with respect to Buyer Common Stock during the Earnout Period shall be set
aside and not paid until the 2019 Earnout Shares and 2020 Earnout Shares have
been issued to the Company Stockholders or, if either or both the 2019 Earnout
Shares and the 2020 Earnout Shares are not earned and issued, then all
such dividends or distributions declared during the Earnout Period shall be
forfeited.

(d) _Earnout Procedures_. As soon as practicable (but in any event within 15
days) after the completion of the audited consolidated financial statements of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries (prepared in accordance with GAAP and filed with
the SEC) for each Earnout Year, Buyers Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO")
will prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative a written statement
(each, an "Earnout Statement") that sets forth the CFOs determination in
accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ of the Adjusted
EBITDA and Revenue for such Earnout Year based on such audited financial
statements, and whether the Company Stockholders are entitled to receive any
Earnout Shares for such Earnout Year. The Seller Representative will have 30
days after its receipt of an Earnout Statement to review it. To the extent
reasonably required to complete its review of an Earnout Statement, Buyer and
its Subsidiaries will provide the Seller Representative and its
Representatives with reasonable access to the books and records of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, their respective finance personnel and any other information
that the Seller Representative reasonably requests relating to the
determination of Adjusted EBITDA, Revenue or the Earnout Shares issuable for
such Earnout Year. The Seller Representative may deliver written notice to the
CFO and Buyer on or prior to the 30th day after receipt of an Earnout
Statement specifying in reasonable detail any items that it wishes to dispute
and the basis therefor. If the Seller Representative fails to deliver such
written notice in such 30 day period, the Seller Representative shall have
waived its right to contest such Earnout Statement and the calculations set
forth therein of the Adjusted EBITDA, Revenue or Earnout Shares for such
Earnout Year. If the Seller Representative provides the CFO and Buyer with
written notice of any objections to an Earnout Statement in such 30 day
period, then the Seller Representative and the Buyer Representative will, for
a period of 20 days following the date of delivery of such notice, attempt to
resolve the Seller Representatives objections and any written resolution by
them as to any disputed amount will be final and binding for all purposes
under this Agreement. If at the conclusion of such 20 day period the Seller
Representative and the Buyer Representative have not reached an agreement on
all the Seller Representatives objections with respect to the Earnout
Statement, then upon the written request of either party, the parties will
refer the dispute to the Independent Expert for final resolution in accordance
with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_. Buyer hereby agrees
during the Earnout Period to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain a
financial reporting system that enables the parties to calculate the
Adjusted EBITDA, Revenue and Earnout Shares for purposes of this _Section_ __
_ 2.6_.

(e) If a dispute with respect to an Earnout Statement is submitted in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(d)_ to the Independent Expert for final
resolution, the Parties will follow the procedures set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 2.6(e)_. Each of the Seller Representative and the Buyer Representative
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by the
Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will be
borne by Buyer. The Independent Expert will determine only those issues still
in dispute and the Independent Experts determination will be based solely
upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
determination by the Independent Expert will be based solely on presentations
with respect to such disputed items by the Buyer Representative and the Seller
Representative to the Independent Expert and not on the Independent Experts
independent review; provided, that such presentations will be deemed to
include any work papers, records, accounts or similar materials delivered to
the Independent Expert by the Buyer Representative or the Seller
Representative in connection with such presentations and any materials
delivered to the Independent Expert in

 



17

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 response to requests by the Independent Expert. With respect to any disputed
item, the Independent Experts calculations shall be no greater than the
highest amount calculated with respect to such item in the Earnout Statement
or by the Seller Representative, as the case may be, and no lower than the
lowest amount calculated with respect to such item in the Earnout Statement or
by the Seller Representative, as the case may be. Each of the Seller
Representative and the Buyer Representative will use their reasonable efforts
to make their respective presentations as promptly as practicable following
submission to the Independent Expert of the disputed items, and each such
party will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the
presentation of the other party and any questions and requests of the
Independent Expert. In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _
2.6(e)_. It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Independent Expert
procedures and the activities of the Independent Expert in connection herewith
are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as) an arbitration
proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal arbitration rules
should be followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery).
The Seller Representative and the Buyer Representative will request that the
Independent Experts determination be made within 30 days after its
engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, will be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Buyer Representative and the Seller Representative
and will be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes
hereunder (other than manifest error).

 

(f) _Future Operations_. Following the Closing, the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, including the Company Group, will be entitled to operate their
respective businesses based upon the good faith business requirements of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Each of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including
the Company Group, will be permitted, following the Closing, to make changes
at its sole discretion, based upon the good faith business requirements of
the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, to its operations, organization, personnel,
accounting practices and other aspects of its business, including actions that
may have an impact on the ability of the Company Stockholders to earn the
Earnout Shares; provided, that, (a) Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maximize Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in
each of the Earnout Years and (b) each of Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
including the Company Group, shall not take any actions specifically intended
to, or not otherwise motivated by the good faith business requirement of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries, to prevent or impede the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA
or Revenue necessary to earn the maximum number of Earnout Shares or otherwise
frustrate the earning of the Earnout Shares.

 

(g) _Tax Treatment_. The parties further agree that the issuance of any
Earnout Shares under this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, if any, shall be treated by
the parties for federal, state and local income tax purposes (whether foreign
or domestic) as an adjustment to the consideration paid for the purchase by
Buyer of the Company Stock except as otherwise required by a change in
applicable Law after the Agreement Date or a final determination within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (and any similar state, local or non-U.S.
final determination).

 

2.7 _Lock-Up Period; Stop-Transfer Notices._

 

(a) _Lock-Up Agreement_. Each Seller agrees that such Seller shall not
Transfer any Buyer Common Stock issued to such Seller as part of the Closing
Share Consideration or any Earnout Shares that may have been issued to such
Seller until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing Date or
(ii) the date, following the Closing Date, on which (x) the last sale price
of Buyer Common Stock equals or exceeds US$12.00 per share (as adjusted for
stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the
like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period commencing at
least 150 days after the Closing Date or (y) Buyers completion of a
liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction that results
in all of Buyers stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of
Buyer Common Stock for cash, securities or other property (the "Lock-up
Period"). For clarity, no restrictions under this _Section_ __ _
2.7(a)_ shall apply to any Earnout Shares issued after the expiration of the
Lock-Up Period.

(b)  _Permitted Transfers_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Lock-up
Period, Transfers of Transaction Securities are permitted to be made (a) in
the case of an entity, as a distribution to its partners, stockholders or
members; (b) in the case of an individual, by a bona fide gift to one of the
members of the individuals immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of
which is a member of the individuals immediate

 family, for estate planning purposes; (c) in the case of an individual, by
virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; (d)
in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order; provided, however, that in each case of clauses (a) through (d), these
permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound
by these transfer restrictions and the other terms described in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ to the extent and for the duration that such terms remain
in effect at the time of the Transfer.

 

(c) _Stop-Transfer Notice_. Each holder of Buyer Common Stock, inclusive of
any Person to whom shares of Buyer Common Stock have been Transferred by a
Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_) (the "Holder", and
collectively the "Holders") of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement hereby authorizes Buyer during each applicable Lock-Up Period to
cause its transfer agent for the shares of Buyer Common Stock that are subject
to restriction on Transfer during the applicable Lock-Up Period ("Lock-up
Shares") to decline to transfer, and to note stop transfer restrictions on the
stock register and other records relating to, such Lock-up Shares for which
the undersigned is the record holder and, in the case of Lock-up Shares for
which the Holder is the beneficial holder but not the record holder, such
Holder agrees during the applicable Lock-Up Period to cause the record holder
to cause the relevant transfer agent to decline to transfer, and to note stop
transfer restrictions on the stock register and other records relating to,
such Lock-up Shares, if such Transfer would constitute a violation or breach
of this Agreement. In addition, any Holder who is not a resident of the United
States and is not an accredited investor as defined under Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act hereby authorizes Buyer to instruct its
transfer agent to note that such Transaction Securities were issued under an
exemption from registration under Regulation S and to utilize the CREST
electronic clearing system for the purpose of compliance with legend and
transfer restriction requirements as provided for by Regulation S. In
addition, each Holder agrees that Buyer may issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to its transfer agent in order to ensure compliance with the
Securities Act, including as to Regulation S as applicable.

 

(d) _Limited Exception to Satisfy Tax Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_, to the extent any Seller
reasonably expects to incur a Tax obligation as a result of the receipt by
such Seller of any Buyer Common Stock issued to such Seller as part of the
Closing Share Consideration or any Earnout Shares, then, upon presentation of
satisfactory evidence of such obligation to the Chief Executive Officer or
Chief Financial Officer of Buyer, at the Chief Executive Officers or Chief
Financial Officers sole discretion, such Seller shall be permitted to
Transfer for value a sufficient number of shares Buyer Common Stock to
satisfy such Tax obligation and, upon the determination of the Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Buyer that such a Transfer is otherwise
permitted by Applicable Law, Buyer shall instruct its transfer agent to
permit such Transfer notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_ any stop transfer
restrictions otherwise applicable under _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_.

 

(e) _Releases from Lock-Ups_. Buyer will not grant an early release or waiver
of the restrictions imposed by any lock-up agreement upon any of Buyers
Sponsors during the Lock-Up Period unless a similar release or waiver, on a
pro rata basis, is provided to the Sellers from the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 2.7(a)_.

2.8 _Further Assurances_ _._  If, at any time before or after the Closing,
any of the Parties reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Transactions or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at or after the Closing, then Company, the Company Stockholders,
Buyer and their respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver
all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and assurances and do all
other things reasonably necessary to consummate the Transactions and to carry
out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.

 2.9 _Tax Withholding_ _._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Buyer and the Company Group (or any other Person required
to withhold with respect to any payment made under this Agreement) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Earnout
Shares) such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under any provision of Applicable Laws. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

10.2(c)_ (provided, however, that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach which by its nature is incapable of being be
cured) and if not cured on or prior to the Closing Date, such breach would
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.3(b)_, as applicable, to be fulfilled or satisfied (treating the Closing
Date for such purpose as of the date of such breach); provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 10.2(c)_
shall not be available to a Party if the Party is at that time in material
breach of this Agreement.

10.3 _Effect of Termination_ _._ This Agreement may only be terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ and
pursuant to a written notice delivered by the applicable Party to the other
applicable Parties, which sets forth the basis for such termination,
including the provision of _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2_
under which such termination is made. In the event of a termination of this
Agreement as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Buyer, Company, or their respective Representatives;
provided, however, that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ (Effect
of Termination) and _Article XI_ (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement and without
limiting  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, nothing herein shall relieve any Party from
liability in connection with any willful breach of any of such Partys
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or any fraud of such
Party, in either case, prior to the termination of this Agreement, and
subject to the right to seek injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.7_, the Parties sole
right prior to the Closing with respect to any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein by another Party or with respect to the
Transactions shall be the right, if applicable, to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_.

ARTICLE XI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 11.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust Account._ Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. Company and each Seller represents and warrants that it has read
the IPO Prospectus and understands that Buyer has established the 

 



53

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and overallotment shares
acquired by Buyers underwriters (including interest accrued from time to time
thereon) for the benefit of Buyers public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by Buyers underwriters) (the "Public
Stockholders") and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus,
Buyer may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public
Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their shares of Buyer Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of Buyers initial business
combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) ("Business
Combination") or in connection with an extension of the deadline to consummate
a Business Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if Buyer fails to
consummate a Business Combination within 24 months after the closing of the
IPO, (c) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust
Account, as necessary to pay any franchise or income Taxes, and (d) to Buyer
after or concurrently with the consummation of its Business Combination. For
and in consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, Company and each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Company Group or any Seller does now and shall at any
time prior to the Closing have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind
in or to any monies in the Trust Account (or, or at any time hereafter, to
distributions therefrom to Public Stockholders or otherwise occurring prior to
the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement
"Public Distributions"), or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any Public Distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to,
this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between Buyer
or its Representatives, on the one hand, and Company, any Seller or their
respective Representatives, on the other hand, this Agreement or any other
matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort,
equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are
collectively referred to hereafter as the "Released Claims"). Company and each
Seller on behalf of itself and their respective Affiliates hereby irrevocably
waives any Released Claims that Company, such Seller or their respective
Affiliates may have against the Trust Account now or in the future (in each
case, however, prior to the consummation of a Business Combination) as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
Buyer or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any Public Distributions therefrom) for any reason
whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other
agreement with Buyer or its Affiliates). Company and each Seller on behalf of
itself and their respective Affiliates agrees and acknowledges that such
irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon
by Buyer and its Affiliates to induce Buyer to enter in this Agreement, and
Company and each Seller further intends and understands such waiver to be
valid, binding and enforceable against Company, each Seller and their
respective Affiliates. To the extent Company, a Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Buyer or
its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary
relief against Buyer or its Representatives, Company and each Seller hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Companys, each Sellers and their respective
Affiliates sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust
Account and that such claim shall not permit any of Company, any Seller or
their respective Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any of their behalves
or in lieu of them) to have any claim against the Trust Account (including
any Public Distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit Companys or the Seller Representatives right to pursue a claim
against Buyer for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the
Trust Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.7_ (including a claim for Buyer to specifically perform
its obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance
of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the
Redemption) to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Trust Agreement, or for Buyers fraud, and (y) nothing
herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that Company may have in
the future against Buyers assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account to
Buyer and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such
funds). This _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ shall survive termination of this
Agreement for any reason.

11.2 _Public Announcements._ The Parties agree that no public release, filing
or announcement concerning this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the
Transactions shall be issued by any Party or any of their Affiliates without
the prior written consent of Buyer and Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any securities exchange, in which case the applicable Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Parties reasonable time to
comment on, and arrange for any required filing with respect to, such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
following the public announcement of the deal and the Closing, the Seller
Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Seller Representative in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein as long as such announcement does
not disclose any of the other terms of the Transactions.

11.3 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._

(a) This Agreement and any claim, cause of action (in law or equity),
controversy or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of
the Transactions, the relationship of the Parties, and/or the interpretation,
performance and enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties, whether
arising in contract, tort, statutory or otherwise, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (including in
respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations period applicable
to any such claim, controversy or dispute), in each case without giving effect
to any conflicts-of-law or other principle that might require the application
of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by any other Party or
its successors or assigns may be brought and determined by the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or if jurisdiction is not proper in such
court, in Superior Court seated in New Castle County Delaware, or if
jurisdiction is not proper in such court, a federal court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware (and in each case, any appellate courts thereof) and each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(and agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto
except in such courts). Each of the Parties further agrees to accept service
of process in any manner permitted by such court. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
lawfully to serve process, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such court (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that (A) the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 11.4 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns._ No Party may assign
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

 11.5 _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such 

 



55

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

 

11.6 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any Party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of all Parties reflected hereon as signatories.

11.7 _Other Remedies_ _._ Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party hereunder shall be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law on such Party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement
to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be
inadequate.

11.8 _Amendments and Waivers_ _._ Any term or provision of this Agreement may
be amended, supplemented or modified only by execution of a written instrument
signed by Buyer, Company and, to the extent such amendment, supplement or
modification affects any of the rights or obligations of the Seller
Representative, the Seller Representative. The observance of any term of this
Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and
either retroactively or prospectively), only by a writing signed by the Party
to be bound thereby. The waiver by a Party of any breach hereof or default in
the performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. At any time prior to
the Closing, Company, Sellers and Buyer may, to the extent legally allowed,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to it contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective
unless signed in writing by the Party against whom such waiver or extension
is asserted. The failure of any Party to enforce any of the provisions hereof
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such Party thereafter to
enforce such provisions.

 

11.9 _Expenses_ _._ If the Transactions are not consummated, each Party shall
bear its respective legal, accountants, and financial advisory fees and other
expenses incurred with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions
(collectively "Expenses"). If the Transactions are consummated, Buyer shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Expenses at or after the Closing, including the
Transaction Expenses.

11.10 _Notices_ _._ All notices and other communications required or
permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand
delivered in person, sent by certified or registered first-class mail, postage
pre-paid, sent by nationally recognized express courier service or sent by
email. Such notices and other communications shall be effective upon receipt
if hand delivered or sent by email (with affirmative confirmation of receipt),
three business days after mailing if sent by mail, and one business day after
dispatch if sent by

this Agreement to Exhibits, Sections or Articles, such reference shall be to
an Exhibit to, Section of or Article of this Agreement, respectively, unless
otherwise indicated. The words "include", "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words of
similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section or subsection
of this Agreement. The defined terms herein shall apply equally to both the
singular and plural forms of the terms defined. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The Parties agree that they have
been represented by legal counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document shall be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document. Any dollar amount included herein shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality," "Material
Adverse Effect" or any other similar qualification in this Agreement.
References to "U.S. Dollars" or "US$" shall mean the lawful currency of the
United States of America. For purposes of _Article III_ of this Agreement,
references to amounts in U.S. Dollars shall include the equivalent value, as
of the Agreement Date, of any applicable foreign currency, including for
purposes of the thresholds in _Section_ __ _ 3.11_.

 

11.12 _Third Party Beneficiary Rights._ Other than as set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.12_ hereof and the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, no
provisions of this Agreement are intended, nor shall be interpreted, to
provide or create any third party beneficiary rights or any other rights of
any kind in, or deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any client,
customer, employee, Affiliate, stockholder or partner of any Party or any
other Person that is not a Party hereto or a successor or permitted assign of
such Party, and all provisions hereof shall be personal solely between the
Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) to the
extent not a Party to this Agreement, the Company Stockholders (and their
successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third party beneficiaries
of, and may enforce, _Article II_ and (b) the past, present and future
directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders
and Representatives of Company and the Company Stockholders, and any
Affiliate of the foregoing (and their successors, heirs and representatives)
are intended third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Article VI_.

 

11.13 _Entire Agreement_ _._ This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules hereto

agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings,
inducements or conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the
Parties other than the Confidentiality Agreement. The express terms hereof
control and supersede any course of performance or usage of the trade
inconsistent with any of the terms hereof. In furtherance of, and without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that (i) the execution of
this Agreement is the culmination of extensive negotiations between them, all
of which were intended to be non-binding upon the Parties until memorialized
in the executed copy of this Agreement and none of which should be construed
as having created any type of oral agreement between the Parties, and (ii)
except as expressly provided in _Article III_ (as modified by the
Company Disclosure Schedule), _Article IV_ , and _Article V_ (as modified by
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule), none of the Parties hereto has made or is
making any representations or warranties whatsoever, implied or otherwise.

11.14 _Seller Representative._

 

(a) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Sellers on
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Shareholder Representative Services LLC, in its
capacity as the Seller Representative, as the true and lawful agent
and attorney-in-fact of the Sellers with full powers of substitution to act
in the name, place and stead of thereof with respect to the performance on
behalf of such Person following the Closing under the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller Representative
is a party, as the same may be from time to time amended, and to do or refrain
from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents on behalf of such Person following the Closing, if any, as the
Seller Representative will deem necessary or appropriate in connection with
any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller Representative is a party, including,
solely in each case, following the Closing: (i) making on behalf of such
Person any determinations and taking all actions on their behalf relating to
the achievement of the Earnout Shares under _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and any
disputes with respect thereto; (ii) signing on behalf of such Person any
releases or other documents with respect to any dispute or remedy arising
under  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements to
which the Seller Representative is a party; (iii) employing and obtaining the
advice of legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as
the Seller Representative, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or
advisable in the performance of its duties as the Seller Representative and to
rely on their advice and counsel; (iv) incurring and paying reasonable costs
and expenses, including fees of brokers, attorneys and accountants incurred
pursuant to the Transactions, and any other reasonable fees and expenses
allocable or in any way relating to such Transactions, incurred subsequent to
Closing; and (v) otherwise enforcing the rights and obligations of any such
Persons under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller
Representative is a party. All decisions and actions by the Seller
Representative, shall be binding upon each of the Company Stockholders and
their respective successors and assigns, and they shall not have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.14_ are irrevocable and coupled with an interest. The
Seller Representative hereby accepts its appointment and authorization as the
Seller Representative under this Agreement.

 

(b) Any other Person, including Buyer, Company and the Company Stockholders
may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any actions of
the Seller Representative as the acts of the Company Stockholders hereunder or
any Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller Representative is a party. Buyer
and Company shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions
and decisions of the Seller Representative as to (i) any payment instructions
provided by the Seller Representative or (ii) any other actions required or
permitted to be taken by the Seller Representative hereunder, and neither
Company nor any Company Stockholder shall have any cause of action against
Buyer or Company for any action taken by any of them in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of the Seller Representative. Buyer and Company
shall not have any liability to Company or any Company Stockholder for any
allocation or distribution among the Company Stockholders by the Seller
Representative of payments made to or at the direction of the Seller
Representative. All notices or other communications required to be made
or delivered to a Company Stockholder under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to which the Seller Representative is a party after the Closing
shall be made to the Seller Representative for the benefit of such Company
Stockholder, and any notices so made shall discharge in full all notice
requirements of the other parties hereto or thereto to such Company
Stockholder with respect thereto. All notices or other communications required
to be made or delivered by a Company Stockholder following the Closing shall
be made by the Seller Representative (except for a notice under _Section_ __ _
11.14(d)_) of the replacement of the Seller Representative).

 

(c) Following the Closing, the Seller Representative will act for the Company
Stockholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner
the Seller Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Stockholders, but the Seller Representative will not be responsible or liable
to Company or the Company Stockholders for any losses that the Company or
the Company Stockholders may suffer by reason of the performance by the
Seller Representative of the Seller Representatives duties under this
Agreement, other than losses arising from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct by the Seller Representative in the

 



59

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 performance of its duties under this Agreement. Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Seller Representative from and against any and
all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any
legal counsel retained by the Seller Representative
(collectively, "Representative Losses"), in each case as such Representative
Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller
Representative, the Seller Representative will reimburse Buyer the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Seller Representative by the Buyer, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Seller Representative from (i) the Sellers and (ii) any
Earnout Shares at such time as any such amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Sellers; provided, that while this section allows the
Seller Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds,
this does not relieve the Buyer from its obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Seller Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In no event will the Seller Representative be required to advance
its own funds on behalf of the Sellers or Buyer or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the Buyer set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided
to the Seller Representative under this section. In no event shall the Seller
Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith for any indirect,
punitive, special or consequential damages. The Seller Representative shall
not be liable for any act done or omitted under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement in connection with its duties as the Seller Representative
while acting in good faith and without willful misconduct or gross negligence,
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Seller Representative shall be
fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand, certificate or
document that it in good faith believes to be genuine, including facsimiles
or copies thereof, and no Person shall have any liability for relying on the
Seller Representative in the foregoing manner. In connection with the
performance of its rights and obligations hereunder, the
Seller Representative shall have the right at any time and from time to time
to select and engage, at the reasonable cost and expense of Buyer, attorneys,
accountants, investment bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical personnel
and obtain such other professional and expert assistance, maintain such
records and incur other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, as the Seller
Representative may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate from time to
time. All of the indemnities, immunities, releases and powers granted to the
Seller Representative under this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ shall survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Seller Representative or the
termination of this Agreement and continue indefinitely.

(d) If the Seller Representative shall die, become disabled, dissolve, resign
or otherwise be unable or unwilling to fulfill its responsibilities as
representative and agent of Company Stockholders, then the Company
Stockholders shall, within ten (10) days after such death,
disability, dissolution, resignation or other event, appoint a successor
Seller Representative (by vote or written consent of the Company Stockholders
holding in the aggregate in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company Stock
as of the Closing (or the date of such vote or consent, if earlier)), and
promptly thereafter (but in any event within two (2) Business Days after such
appointment) notify Buyer in writing of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor so appointed shall become the "Seller Representative" for
purposes of this Agreement.

11.15 _Acknowledgement; Waiver of Conflicts; Retention of Privilege._

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Cooley LLP ("Prior
Company Counsel") has acted as counsel to the Company Group in various
matters involving a range of issues and as counsel to the Company in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, and the Transactions.

(b) In connection with any matter or dispute under this Agreement, Buyer
hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and, following the
Closing, agrees to cause the Company Group to irrevocably waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) Prior
Company Counsels prior representation of the Company Group and (ii) Prior
Company Counsels representation of the Seller Representative (collectively,
the "Advised Parties") prior to and after the Closing.

 

(c) Buyer further agree, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on behalf
of the Company Group, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Prior Company Counsel, Company, any of the
Advised Parties, or any of their respective Representatives that relate in any
way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions
or, beginning on the Agreement Date, any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and
owned collectively by the Advised Parties, shall be controlled by the
Seller Representative on behalf of the Company Group and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Buyer or the Company Group. All Deal Communications that are
attorney-client privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall
remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of
client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Seller
Representative, shall be controlled by the Seller Representative on behalf of
the Company Group and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company
Group; provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be
a waiver by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company Group) of any applicable privileges or protections that can or may be
asserted to prevent disclosure of any such communications to any third party.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Seller Representative
or any of the Company Stockholders, on the other hand, Buyer or the Company
Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of
the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party; provided, however,
that neither Buyer nor the Company Group may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Seller Representative. In the event that Buyer
or the Company Group is legally required by governmental order or otherwise to
access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Deal
Communications, Buyer shall immediately (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) notify the Seller Representative in writing (including by
making specific reference to this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_) so that the Seller
Representative can seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

(e) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Prior
Company Counsel constitute property of its clients, only the Seller
Representative shall hold such property rights and Prior Company Counsel shall
have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any
Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the
other hand so long as such files or other materials would be subject to a
privilege or protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an
unrelated third party.

(f) Buyer agrees on behalf of itself and the Company Group, (i) to the extent
that Buyer or, after the Closing, any Company Group Member, receives or takes
physical possession of any Deal Communications, (A) such physical possession
or receipt shall not, in any way, be deemed a waiver by any of the Advised
Parties or any other Person, of the privileges or protections described in
this section, and (B) neither Buyer nor any Company Group Member shall assert
any claim that any of the Advised Parties or any other Person waived
the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or any other
right or expectation of client confidence applicable to any such materials or
communications, (ii) not to access or use the Deal Communications, including
by way of review of any electronic data, communications or other information,
or by seeking to have the Seller Representative waive the attorney-client or
other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Buyer or any Company Group
Member has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege and
(iii) not to seek to obtain the Deal Communications from Prior Company Counsel
so long as such Deal Communications would be subject to a privilege or
protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third
party.

of directors of Buyer and any restrictions deemed appropriate or necessary by
the board of directors of Buyer. An individual shall be eligible to receive a

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to (i) that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Purchase
Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, by and among GigCapital, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), Kaleyra, S.p.A., a company with shares formed
under the laws of Italy (the "Company"), the shareholders of Kaleyra
identified therein (the "Sellers") and Shareholder Representative Services
LLC, as the representative of the Sellers (the "Seller Representative"), and
(ii) that certain letter agreement (the "Insider Letter"), dated December 7,
2017, between Buyer and each of GigAcquisitions, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("GigAcquisitions"), and Cowen Investments II LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company as successor to Cowen Investments LLC
("Cowen"), Irwin Silverberg ("Silverberg") and Jeffrey Bernstein ("Bernstein"
and together with GigAcquisitions, Cowen and Silverberg, the "Sponsors", and
each a "Sponsor"), with respect to certain matters, including the transfer of
shares of common stock of Buyer ("Common Stock") held of record by each of the
Sponsors (as further described on _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ hereto, the "Founder
Shares"). This letter agreement (this "Agreement") represents the "Founder
Shares Agreement" contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in the Purchase Agreement.

In order to induce the Buyer and Sellers to enter into the Purchase Agreement
and to proceed with the Transactions and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
each Sponsor, hereby agrees, for the benefit of Buyer, Sellers and the Seller
Representative, as follows:

 

1\. Each Sponsor agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Insider Letter, the number of Founder Shares with respect to
each Sponsor as is set forth opposite such Sponsors name under the column on
_Exhibit A_ that corresponds to the range within which the actual Redemption
Percentage falls (as to each such Sponsor, its "Sponsor Earnout Shares")
shall be subject to vesting and forfeiture as follows:

(a) 50% of such Sponsors Sponsor Earnout Shares (the "2019 Sponsor Earnout
Shares") will irrevocably vest in the event that it is finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Purchase Agreement that (A) Revenue for Fiscal
Year 2019 is equal to or greater than the product of the Pro forma Revenue
multiplied by 1.3 (the "2019 Revenue Target") and (B) Adjusted EBITDA for
Fiscal Year 2019 is equal to or greater than the product of the Pro forma
Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by 1.45 (the "2019 Adjusted EBITDA Target") and
(C) the 2019 Earnout Shares have become issuable as a result thereof. To the
extent

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 that the 2019 Adjusted EBITDA Target has been achieved and Revenue for
Fiscal Year 2019 is at least 80% of the 2019 Revenue Target but less than the
2019 Revenue Target, then the number of 2019 Sponsor Earnout Shares that vest
shall be reduced by 0.5% for every 1.0% Revenue for Fiscal Year 2019 is below
the 2019 Revenue Target and the remaining 2019 Sponsor Earnout Shares shall be
forfeited in accordance with Section 4(a);

 

(b) 50% of such Sponsors Sponsor Earnout Shares (the "2020 Sponsor Earnout
Shares") will irrevocably vest in the event that it is finally determined
pursuant Section 2.6 of the Purchase Agreement that (A) Revenue for Fiscal
Year 2020 is equal to or greater than the product of the Revenue for Fiscal
Year 2019 multiplied by 1.3 (the "2020 Revenue Target") and (B) Adjusted
EBITDA for Fiscal Year 2020 is equal to or greater than the product of
Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year 2019 multiplied by 1.45 (the "2020 Adjusted
EBITDA Target") and (C) the 2020 Earnout Shares have become issuable as a
result thereof. To the extent that the 2020 Adjusted EBITDA Target has been
achieved and Revenue for Fiscal Year 2020 is at least 80% of the 2019 Revenue
Target but less than the 2020 Revenue Target, then the number of 2020 Sponsor
Earnout Shares that vest shall be reduced by 0.5% for every 1.0% Revenue for
Fiscal Year 2020 is below the 2020 Revenue Target and the remaining 2020
Sponsor Earnout Shares shall be forfeited in accordance with Section 4(b);
and

(c) Any Sponsor Earnout Shares that have not yet vested, or been forfeited
in accordance with Section 4(a) or 4(b), shall irrevocably vest if, and
concurrently with, Earnout Shares becoming issuable under the Purchase
Agreement on account of an Acceleration Event.

 

2\. Each Sponsor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, prior to
the vesting of such Sponsors Sponsor Earnout Shares, such Sponsor shall not
Transfer (as defined below) all or any portion of such Sponsors Sponsor
Earnout Shares, other than to a permitted transferees described in Section 9
of the Insider Letter who enters into a written agreement for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement pursuant to which such permitted transferee
agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement; provided that,
following such Transfer, such Sponsor continues to beneficially own such
transferred Sponsor Earnout Shares for all purposes, including voting rights.

3\. "Transfer" shall mean (a) any direct or indirect offer to sell, sale,
assignment, Encumbrance, disposition, loan, hypothecation, grant of any option
to purchase or otherwise dispose of, grant of any interest in or other
transfer (by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntary or involuntary,
or entry into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with
respect to any offer to sell, sale, assignment, Encumbrance, disposition,
loan, hypothecation or other transfer (by operation of law or otherwise), of
any Sponsor Earnout Shares or interest in any Sponsor Earnout Shares or
establishment or increase of a put equivalent position or liquidation with
respect to or decrease of a call equivalent position within the meaning of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to the Sponsor Earnout Shares, (b) the entry into any
swap or other agreement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any Sponsor Earnout Shares or
interest in any Sponsor Earnout Shares, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of such Sponsor Earnout Shares or interest in such Sponsor
Earnout Shares, in cash or otherwise or (c) the public announcement of any
intention to effect any transaction described in clause (a) or (b).

4\. (a) If any of the 2019 Sponsor Earnout Shares of a Sponsor that could be
vested pursuant to clause (a) of _Section_ __ _ 1_ have not vested pursuant
to such clause (a) of _Section_ __ _ 1_, then upon the final determination
that the Company Stockholders are not entitled to or eligible to receive all
or a portion of the 2019 Earnout Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
such number of 2019 Sponsor Earnout Shares that have not vested shall be
forfeited to Buyer without consideration and the Sponsors will deliver any
such forfeited 2019 Sponsor Earnout Shares to Buyer in certificated or book
entry form (as applicable) for cancellation by Buyer.

 

(b) If any of the 2020 Sponsor Earnout Shares of a Sponsor that could be
vested pursuant to clause (b) of  _Section_ __ _ 1_ have not vested pursuant
to such clause (b) of _Section_ __ _ 1_, then upon the final determination
that

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 the Company Stockholders are not entitled to or eligible to receive all or a
portion of the 2020 Earnout Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, such
number of 2020 Sponsor Earnout Shares that have not vested shall be forfeited
to Buyer without consideration and the Sponsors will deliver any such
forfeited 2020 Sponsor Earnout Shares to Buyer in certificated or book entry
form (as applicable) for cancellation by Buyer.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, upon any such forfeiture, such forfeited Sponsor
Earnout Shares shall be transferred to Buyer for cancellation and in exchange
for no consideration. All certificates representing the Sponsor Earnout
Shares will have endorsed legends thereon noting that such Sponsor Earnout
Shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and such
other applicable restrictions under applicable securities laws.

5\. Prior to the vesting of any Sponsor Earnout Shares hereunder, the holder
of such Sponsor Earnout Shares shall nevertheless retain the right to vote
such Sponsor Earnout Shares until such Sponsor Earnout Shares are forfeited.

6\. Until Sponsor Earnout Shares have vested or been forfeited hereunder, an
amount equal to any dividends or distributions that would have been payable to
the Sponsors with respect to their Sponsor Earnout Shares if the Sponsor
Earnout Shares had vested prior to the record date for such dividends or
distributions shall be withheld by the Buyer for the benefit of the Sponsors
with respect to the Sponsor Earnout Shares (the "Withheld Amount"). If any
securities of the Buyer or any other Person are included in the Withheld
Amount, then any dividends or distributions in respect of or in exchange for
any of such securities in the Withheld Amount, whether by way of stock splits
or otherwise, shall be delivered to the Buyer and included in the "Withheld
Amount", and will be released to the Buyer or the Sponsors, as applicable,
upon the release of the corresponding securities. If and when the Sponsor
Earnout Shares vest in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1_, the Buyer shall
release to each Sponsor, the aggregate amount of the Withheld Amount
attributable to such Sponsors Sponsor Earnout Shares that have vested and, if
applicable, shall continue to withhold any remaining Withheld Amount that is
attributable to the Sponsor Earnout Shares that have not yet vested until such
Sponsor Earnout Shares vest, in which case such remaining Withheld Amount
shall be released to the Sponsors with respect to their Sponsor Earnout
Shares. If all or any portion of the Sponsor Earnout Shares are forfeited to
the Buyer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4_, then the portion of the
Withheld Amount attributable to the portion of the Sponsor Earnout Shares
that have been forfeited to the Buyer shall be automatically forfeited to
Buyer without consideration and with no further action required of any person.

 

7\. This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement to the extent
referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the

matter hereof. This Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived
(other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision,
except by a written instrument executed by all parties hereto.

 

8\. No party hereto may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each
of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment in violation of this
paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or
assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Agreement shall
be binding on each of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

9\. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws
principles thereof. The parties hereto (a) all agree that any action,
proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to,
this Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks
jurisdiction, then in the applicable Delaware state court), or if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction of such action is vested in the federal
courts, then the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
and

 irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and
venue shall be exclusive, and (b) waive any objection to such exclusive

provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

which shall be an original as regards any party whose signature appears
thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts
hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures of all
parties reflected hereon as signatories.

_CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED PROMISSORY NOTE_

 

U.S. $[●]

 

[●], 2019

 

[●], California

 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Kaleyra, Inc. (f/k/a GigCapital, Inc.), a
Delaware corporation (" _Maker_ "), promises to pay to the order of [●], [an
individual][entity], (" _Payee_ "), at  _ _ or at
such other place as Payee may designate, the principal sum of [●] Dollars
($[●]), with interest thereon as provided in this Unsecured Promissory Note ("
_Note_ ").

1\. This Note is being executed in connection with the closing of a Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of [●], 2019 by and between Maker, Kaleyra S.p.A.,
a company with shares formed under the laws of Italy (" _Kaleyra_ "), all of
the shareholders of Kaleyra, including Payee (" _Sellers_ "), and [●], as
representative for the Sellers (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "). All capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Purchase Agreement. As is further set forth in the Purchase Agreement, this
Note shall be delivered on the Closing Date, and the principal amount of the
Note may be adjusted in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.

 

2\. Fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding principal balance of this Note
shall be due and payable on the fifteen month anniversary of the Closing
Date. The remaining outstanding principal balance of this Note plus all
accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under this Note and the Purchase
Agreement shall be due and payable in full on the twenty-four month
anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Maker receives, at any time while principal of this Note remains
outstanding, cash proceeds of an equity financing (the " _Financing_ ") in an
amount not less than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) (the " _Financing
Proceeds_ "), fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding principal balance of this
Note shall be due and payable to Payee no later than ten (10) Business Days
after Maker receives the Financing Proceeds. The remaining outstanding
principal balance of this Note after payment of the Financing Proceeds, plus
all accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under this Note and the Purchase
Agreement shall be due and payable in full on the twenty-four month
anniversary of the Closing Date. In the event of a Financing where at any time
the Maker receives cash proceeds of such Financing in an amount not less than
Seventy-five Million Dollars ($75,000,000.00) (the " _Payoff Financing
Proceeds_ "), one hundred percent (100%) of the remaining outstanding
principal balance of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest and fees
due under this Note and the Purchase Agreement shall due and payable no later
than ten (10) Business Days after Maker receives the Payoff Financing
Proceeds. The date which is the earlier of (a) the twenty-four month
anniversary of the Closing Date, or (b) the date payment is received from
Payoff Financing Proceeds is hereinafter the " _Maturity Date_."

3\. Commencing on the date hereof until the earlier of payment in full on (a)
the twenty-four month anniversary of the Closing Date, or (b) the date payment
is received from Payoff Financing Proceeds, interest shall accrue at a fixed
interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of one percent (1%) per annum,
which interest

 



1

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 rate as of the date hereof is [●] percent ([●]%), and which such interest
shall be due and payable annually on the date which is the twelve month
anniversary of the Closing Date and on the date which is the twenty-four
month anniversary of the Closing Date. As used herein, " _LIBOR_ " means the
one-year U.S. Dollar LIBOR interest rate published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ on the Closing Date. All interest shall be computed on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

 

4\. In the event that this Note is not paid in full on or before the Maturity
Date, then at any time after the sixtieth business day after the Maturity
Date and assuming payment in full has not been made prior to such date, the
outstanding principal amount of this Note together with all accrued but unpaid
interest thereon may be converted, in part or in whole, at the option of
Payee, into shares of Makers common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "
_Common Stock_ ") as provided below. A conversion of any portion of this Note
into shares of Common Stock shall be effected at a conversion price equal to
the Current Market Price as of the date of such conversion (the " _Conversion
Price_ "). As used herein, the term " _Current Market Price_ " means,
generally, the average VWAP for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on
the date that is five trading days prior to the date of conversion. As used
herein, the term " _VWAP_ " means, for any trading day, the volume weighted
average trading price of the Common Stock for such trading day on the NYSE (or
if the Common Stock is no longer traded on the NYSE, on such other exchange
as the Common Stock are then traded). To effect a conversion under this
_Section_ __ _ 4_, Payee shall provide written notice of such conversion to
Maker, along with such other documents required under _Section_ __ _ 5_
hereof, at least three Business Days prior to the date of conversion, and the
written notice shall state the date on which the conversion will occur.

 

5\. As soon as practicable after conversion of this Note pursuant to Section 4
hereof, Payee agrees to surrender this Note for conversion at the principal
office of Maker and agrees to execute all appropriate documentation necessary
to effect such conversion. As soon as practicable thereafter, Maker, at its
expense, will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to Payee,
a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
which Payee shall be entitled on such conversion (bearing such legends as may
be required by applicable state and federal securities laws in the opinion of
legal counsel for Maker). Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made
immediately prior to the close of business on the applicable conversion date
set forth in Section 4 above, regardless of whether the Note has been
surrendered on such date, provided that Maker shall not be required to issue
a certificate for shares to Payee prior to the surrender of this Note. No
fractional shares will be issued on conversion of this Note; in lieu of any
fractional share to which Payee would otherwise be entitled, Maker shall pay
to Payee the amount of the outstanding principal balance and/or accrued
interest due that is not so converted, such payment to be in cash or by check.
Payee understands that Payee shall not have any of the rights of a
stockholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of any principal or accrued interest of this Note, until such
principal or accrued interest is converted into capital stock of Maker as
provided herein.

 

6\. This Note is one of a series of individual Notes issued by the Maker to
one or more Sellers pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. This
Note shall rank at all times at least _pari passu_ in right of priority of
payment and in all other respects with all other Notes issued by Maker to such
Sellers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

 

7\. If any day on which a payment of principal or interest is due is not a
Business Day, then such payment shall be due on the next succeeding Business
Day.

8\. Maker represents and warrants as follows:



     | (a) |

Maker is duly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of formation and is qualified and licensed to do business in, and is in good
standing in, any state in which the conduct of its business or its ownership

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors generally; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

---|---|---

not cured within five (5) days after Makers receipt of written notice of
such failure; 

---|---|---

composition or other relief with respect to it or its debts or (ii) seeking
appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator or other similar
official for it or for all or any substantial part of its assets, or Maker
makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

there is commenced against Maker any case, proceeding or other action of a
nature referred to in Section 9(b) which (i) results in the entry of an order
for relief or any such adjudication or appointment or (ii) remains
undismissed, undischarged or unbonded for a period of thirty (30) days; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

there is commenced against Maker any case, proceeding or other action seeking
issuance of a warrant of attachment, execution or similar process against all
or any substantial part of its assets which results in the entry of an order
for any such relief which has not been vacated, discharged, or stayed or
bonded pending appeal within thirty (30) days from the entry thereof; 

---|---|--- 



     | (e) |

Maker takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to,
approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the acts set forth in Section 9(b),
(c) and (d); 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Maker breaches any representation or warranty contained in this Note; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) |

Maker is generally not, or shall be unable to, or admits in writing its
inability to pay its debts as they become due; or 

---|---|--- 



     | (h) |

substantially all of the assets of Maker or (ii) a transaction by and between

3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act and used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof,
including a "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)), whereby the
stockholders of Maker immediately prior to such transaction own less than
fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of
the equity of the acquiring or surviving entity, as applicable. 

---|---|--- 

10\. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, without any further act of
Payee or any other Person, the entire unpaid and outstanding principal balance
of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and

 



3

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 any and all other amounts payable hereunder, and all costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the
enforcement and/or collection of this Note, shall immediately be due and
payable, and Payee may exercise all or any of its rights under applicable Law.
The right to plead any and all statutes of limitations as a defense to any
demands hereunder is hereby waived to the full extent permitted by law.

11\. This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part without penalty or premium.
All references to Dollars herein are to lawful currency of the United States
of America.

12\. Any extension of this Note granted to Maker by Payee shall not release
Maker, or constitute a waiver, of any payment due on principal or interest,
or otherwise diminish the rights of Payee. The Maker waives presentment,
protest, demand for payment, notice of dishonor, and any and all other notices
or demands in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default,
or enforcement of this Note. The obligations evidenced or created by this
Note, as well as all waivers of rights by Maker contained herein, shall
effectively bind and be the obligations and waivers of any and all others who
may at any time become liable for the payment of all or any part of this Note,
including, without limitation, all endorsers and guarantors. Payee may assign
or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, this Note or any of
Payees rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, with notice to
but without the express prior written consent of Maker. Subject to the
foregoing, this Note shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and
permissible assigns.

13\. No delay or omission on the part of Payee in exercising any of
its remedies hereunder shall be deemed a continuing waiver of that right or
any other right. The acceptance of Payee of any payment pursuant to the terms
of this Note which is less than payment in full of all amounts due and payable
at the time of such payment shall not constitute a waiver of the right to (a)
collect such payment(s) in full and/or (b) exercise any of the foregoing
options at that time or at any subsequent time or nullify any prior exercise
of any such option, without the express written consent of Payee, except and
as to the extent otherwise required by law.

14\. Nothing herein shall be construed or operate as to require Maker, or any
person liable for the payment of the Note, to pay interest or charges in an
amount or at a rate greater than the highest rate permissible under applicable
law. Should any interest or other charges paid by Maker result in the
computation or earning of interest in excess of such rate, then any and all
such excess shall be and the same is hereby waived by Payee, and all such
excess shall be automatically credited against the principal balance of this
Note, and any portion of said excess that exceeds the principal balance shall
be paid by Payee to Maker.

15\. Any provision of this Note may be amended, waived or modified only upon
the written consent of Maker and Payee. If any provision of this Note is found
to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall remain effective
and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Maker and Payee have
each had the opportunity to have independent legal counsel review and seek to
revise this Note, and this Note therefore shall not be interpreted against any
party as the drafter. This Note shall be governed by, construed and enforced
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

16\. All notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered in the manner provided
in the Purchase Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Maker has executed this Note in favor of Payee as of the
date first written above.

Registration, such registration shall count as a Demand Registration for
purposes of _Section_ __ _ 3.6_.

 

2.2 _Shelf Registration Statements_.

 

2.2.1 _Initial Shelf Registration_. Provided (i) the Company is S-3 Shelf
Eligible and (ii) a Shelf Registration on a Form S-3 registering Registrable
Securities for resale is not then effective (subject to any applicable
Suspension Period), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file
and make effective as soon as practicable, a Registration Statement on Form
S-3 for an offering on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415
promulgated under the Securities Act (a " _Shelf Registration_ "), with
respect to all of the Registrable Securities. The Company shall promptly give
notice (via facsimile or electronic transmission) at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the anticipated filing date of such Shelf Registration to all
Holders of Registrable Securities, and offer such Holders the opportunity to
register the number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request
by written notice to the Company, given within five (5) Business Days after
such Holders are given the Companys notice of the Shelf Registration. The
"Plan of Distribution" section of such Shelf Registration shall permit, in
addition to firm commitment Underwritten Offerings, any other lawful means of
disposition of Registrable Securities, including Alternative Transactions.
With respect to each Shelf Registration, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to remain effective until
the date set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(ii)_. No Holder shall be entitled to
include any of its Registrable Securities in a Shelf Registration unless such
Holder has complied with _Section_ __ _ 3.19_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_ shall not apply if the Company has a currently
effective Automatic Shelf Registration Statement covering all Registrable
Securities in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2.6_ and has otherwise
complied with its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2_. The rights
of with respect to any Shelf Registration shall be subject to Suspension
Periods, as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

2.2.2 _Shelf Take-Downs_. A Holder of Shelf Registered Securities may sell
pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement from time to time in accordance
with the plan of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement. A
Holder or Holders of Shelf Registered Securities may also request (the "
_Shelf Public Offering Request_ ") that a shelf take-down be in the form of
an Underwritten Offering (a " _Shelf Public Offering_ ") if the gross proceeds
reasonably anticipated to be generated from the sale of the Shelf Registered
Securities (as determined in good faith by the relevant Holders and their
Underwriters) equals or exceeds $15,000,000. Promptly upon receipt of a Shelf
Public Offering Request, the Company shall provide notice (the " _Shelf
Public Offering Notice_ ") of such proposed Underwritten Offering (which
notice shall state the material terms of such proposed Underwritten Offering,
to the extent known, as well as the identity of the Shelf Public Offering
Requesting Holder) to the other Holders holding Shelf Registered Securities.
Such other Holders may,

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 by written request to the Company and the Shelf Public Offering, within one
(1) Business Day after receipt of such Shelf Public Offering Notice, offer and
sell up to all of their Shelf Registered Securities of the same class or
series as the Shelf Registered Securities proposed to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering. No Holder shall be entitled to include any of its
Registrable Securities in a Shelf Public Offering unless such Holder has
complied with _Section_ __ _ 3.19_. The Underwriter or Underwriters selected
for such Underwritten Offering shall be selected in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.6_. The terms and conditions of any customary underwriting or
purchase arrangements pursuant to which Registrable Securities shall be sold
in a Shelf Public Offering shall be approved by the Shelf Public Offering
Requesting Holder.

 

2.2.3 _Priority_. In a Shelf Public Offering, if the managing Underwriter
advises the Company and the Shelf Public Offering Requesting Holder that, in
its view, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such Shelf Public Offering (including any securities that the Company proposes
to be included that are not Registrable Securities) exceeds the
Maximum Offering Size, the Company shall include in such Shelf Public
Offering the following securities, in the priority listed below, up to the
Maximum Offering Size; provided, however that the number of Registrable
Securities included in the Shelf Public Offering shall not be reduced below
30% of the total of the Shelf Registrable Securities that are requested to be
included in such Shelf Public Offering:

 

(i) first, Shelf Registrable Securities that are requested to be included in
such Shelf Public Offering, on a pro rata basis on the basis of the Holders
of Shelf Registrable Securities beneficial ownership of the Common Stock;
provided that to the extent a reduction in Registrable Securities included in
the Shelf Public Offering is so required, the calculation of the beneficial
ownership of Registrable Securities shall not include any unvested Earnout
Shares or any shares of Common Stock to be issued for any Convertible Notes;
and

 

(ii) second, all securities that are registered on the applicable Shelf
Registration Statement and are requested to be included in such Shelf Public
Offering by the Company.

2.2.4 _Expenses_. The Company shall bear all Registration Expenses in
connection with any Shelf Registration or Shelf Public Offering pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, including all registration, filing, and
qualification fees; printers and accounting fees; fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company; and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one
counsel for the Holders of Shelf Registrable Securities that are included in
such Shelf Public Offering whether or not such Shelf Registration becomes
effective or such Shelf Public Offering or other transactions is completed;
provided, however that the Company shall not be required to pay for any
expenses of any registration proceeding if the Shelf Public Offering Request
is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities to be registered in such Shelf Public Offering.

2.2.5 _Subsequent Shelf Registration_. After the Registration Statement with
respect to a Shelf Registration is declared effective, upon written request by
one or more Holders (which written request shall specify the amount of such
Holders Registrable Securities to be registered), the Company shall, as
permitted by SEC Guidance, (i) as promptly as practicable after receiving a
request from a Holder that is a Permitted Transferee of a former Holder of
Shelf Registrable Securities, file a prospectus supplement to include
such Permitted Transferee as a selling stockholder in such Registration
Statement, (ii) if it is a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer and such Registration
Statement is an unallocated Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to which
additional selling stockholders may be added by means of a prospectus
supplement under Rule 430B, as promptly as practicable after receiving such
request, file a prospectus supplement to include such Holders as selling
stockholders in such Registration Statement, or (iii) otherwise, as promptly
as practicable after the date the Registrable Securities requested to be
registered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2.5_ that have not already been
so registered represent more than 1.5% of the outstanding Registrable
Securities, file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a
new Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, to include such Holders in
such Shelf Registration and use its commercially reasonable efforts to have
such post-effective amendment or new Shelf Registration Statement declared
effective. To the extent that any Registration Statement with respect to a

 



11

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Shelf Registration is expected to no longer be usable for the resale of
Registrable Securities registered thereon (" _Remaining Registrable
Securities_ ") pursuant to SEC Guidance, the Company shall, not later than
ninety (90) days prior to the date such Registration Statement is expected to
no longer be usable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and
file a new Registration Statement with respect to such Shelf Registration, as
if the holders of such Remaining Registrable Securities had requested a Shelf
Registration with respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_ and
perform all actions required under this Agreement with respect to such Shelf
Registration.

2.2.6 _Automatic Shelf Registration Statements_. Upon the Company becoming a
Well-Known Seasoned Issuer eligible to use an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement in accordance with SEC Guidance, (i) the Company shall give written
notice to all of the Holders of Shelf Registrable Securities as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter,
and such notice shall describe, in reasonable detail, the basis on which the
Company has become a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer, and (ii) upon the request of
the Holders of at least 25% of the Shelf Registrable Securities registered on
such Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, register such Shelf Registrable Securities under an Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement, but in no event later than fifteen (15)
Business Days thereafter, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective thereafter
until the date set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(ii)_. At any time after the
filing of an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement by the Company, if it is
reasonably likely that it will no longer be a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer as of
a future determination date (the " _Determination Date_ "), as promptly as
practicable and at least 30 days prior to such Determination Date, the Company
shall (A) give written notice thereof to all of the Holders and (B) if the
Company is S-3 Shelf Eligible, file a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with
respect to a Shelf Registration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_ and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Registration Statement
declared effective prior to the Determination Date. If the Company has filed
an existing Automatic Shelf Registration Statement that is effective, and it
is likely that such existing Automatic Shelf Registration Statement will no
longer be effective pursuant to SEC Guidance as of a Determination Date,
although the Company will remain a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer as of such
Determination Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
file a new Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to replace such existing
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement prior to such Determination Date and
cause such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective
thereafter until the date set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(ii)_.

2.3 _Piggyback Registration Rights_.

2.3.1 At any time the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement to
register Common Stock under the Securities Act (other than pursuant to
_Sections 2.1_ or _2.2_ ), or to conduct an Underwritten Offering from an
existing Shelf Registration Statement, whether or not for its own account
(other than pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or
any similar or successor form under the Securities Act) or for the account of
any person (other than a Holder pursuant to _Sections 2.1_ or  _2.2_ ), the
Company shall give written notice thereof to each Holder at least thirty (30)
Business Days before such filing or the commencement of such Underwritten
Offering, as applicable, offering each Holder the opportunity to register on
such Registration Statement or including in such Underwritten Offering, as
applicable, such number of Registrable Securities as such Holder may request
in writing not later than twenty (20) Business Days after receiving such
notice in writing from the Company (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Upon
receipt by the Company of any such request, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, or in the case of an Underwritten
Offering, use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Underwriters
to, include such Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement (or in
a separate Registration Statement concurrently filed) and to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective with respect to such Registrable
Securities. If no request for inclusion from a Holder is received by the
Company within the deadlines specified above, such Holder shall have no
further right to participate in such Piggyback Registration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if at any time after giving written notice of a registration in
accordance with the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3.1_ and before
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement described in such notice, the
Company determines for any reason either not to effect such registration or to
delay such registration, the Company may, at its election, by delivery of
written notice to

 



12

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 each Holder exercising its rights to Piggyback Registration, (i) in the case
of a determination not to effect registration, relieve itself of its
obligation to effect a Piggyback Registration of the Registrable Securities
in connection with such registration or (ii) in the case of a determination to
delay registration, delay the Piggyback Registration of such Registrable
Securities of the Holders for the same period as the delay in the
registration of such other Registrable Securities; provided, that in the case
of any such termination, withdrawal or delay, all expenses incurred in
connection with such Piggyback Registration shall be borne entirely by the
Company as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_. If any Holder requests
inclusion in a registration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, he, she, or
it may, at any time before the effective date of the Registration
Statement relating to such registration, revoke such request by delivering
written notice of such revocation to the Company (which notice shall be
effective only upon receipt by the Company, notwithstanding the provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 2_); provided, however, that if the Company, in
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, determines that such
revocation would materially delay the registration or otherwise require a
recirculation of the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, then
such Holder shall have no right to so revoke his, her, or its request. The
Company shall keep the Holder reasonably informed as to the status or expected
timing of the launch of any Public Offering registered pursuant to any such
Piggyback Registration. No registration of Registrable Securities effected
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall relieve the Company of its obligations
to effect any Demand Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ or Shelf
Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. The rights of Holders with
respect to a Piggyback Registration shall be subject to Suspension Periods, as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. To the extent an Underwritten Offering is
made under any such Registration Statement, all Holders exercising their right
to Piggyback Registration must sell their Registrable Securities to the
Underwriters selected as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ on the same terms
and conditions as apply to the other securityholders selling in such
Underwritten Offering.

 

2.3.2 If a Piggyback Registration involves an Underwritten Offering (other
than any Demand Registration, in which case the provisions with respect to
priority of inclusion in such offering set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1.3_
shall apply or a Shelf Public Offering, in which case the provisions with
respect to priority of inclusion in such offering set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 2.2.3_ shall apply) and the managing Underwriter advises the Company that,
in its view, the number of Registrable Securities that the Holders and the
Common Stock that the Company intend to include in such Underwritten Offering
exceeds the Maximum Offering Size, the Company shall include in such
Underwritten Offering the following securities, in the following priority, up
to the Maximum Offering Size, provided, however that the number of
Registrable Securities included in the Underwritten Offering shall not be
reduced below 30% of the total of the Registrable Securities that are
requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering:

 

(i) first, all Common Stock that is requested to be included by the Company in
the Underwritten Offering for its own account; 

(ii) second, Registrable Securities that are requested to be included in the
Underwritten Offering pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ by any Holder on
a pro rata basis on the basis of the requesting Holders beneficial ownership
of the Common Stock; provided that to the extent a reduction in Registrable
Securities included in the Underwritten Offering is so required, the
calculation of the beneficial ownership of Registrable Securities shall not
include any unvested Earnout Shares or any shares of Common Stock to be issued
for any Convertible Notes; and

 

(iii) third, all other securities that are requested to be included in the
Underwritten Offering for the account of any other Persons with such
priorities among them as the Company shall determine.

2.3.3. _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter(s) of his, her or its intention to withdraw from such
Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the SEC with respect to such Piggyback Registration.

 

2.3.4. _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ hereof shall not be
counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ hereof.

2.4 _Underwritten Offering_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no Holder may participate in any Underwritten Offering hereunder unless such
Holder accurately completes and executes in a timely manner all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, custody agreements,
underwriting agreements (as approved in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), and other documents reasonably requested under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements; provided, that all Persons participating in such
Underwritten Offering shall be required to complete and execute, on the same
terms and conditions, such questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
custody agreements, underwriting agreements, and other documents (if
applicable). The right of a Holder to register and sell Registrable Securities
in an Underwritten Offering shall also be subject to any restrictions,
limitations or prohibitions on the sale of Registrable Securities (subject to
the limitations in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_) as may be required by the
Underwriters in the interests of the offering (and, without limiting the
foregoing, each Holder shall in connection therewith agree to be bound by (and
if requested, execute and deliver) a lock-up agreement with
the Underwriter(s) of any such Underwritten Offering as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.7_).

2.5 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good faith estimate of
the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the effective date of, a Company initiated Registration and
provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to
receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1.1_ and it
continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Registration Statement to become effective; (B) the Holders
have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company and the Holders
are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly underwrite the
offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board such Registration would
be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board concludes as a result
that it is essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement at
such time, then in each case the Company shall furnish to such Holders a
certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith
judgment of the Board it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for
such Registration Statement to be filed in the near future and that it is
therefore essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement. In
such event, the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period
of not more than thirty (30) days; __ provided, that the Company may not
defer its obligation in this manner more than once in any 12-month period.

 

2.6 _Suspension_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 2_, but subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, the Company shall be entitled to suspend its obligation
to (a) file or submit (but not to prepare) any Registration Statement in
connection with any Demand Registration or Shelf Registration, (b) file or
submit any amendment to such a Registration Statement, (c) file, submit or
furnish any supplement or amendment to a prospectus included in such a
Registration Statement, (d) make any other filing with the SEC, (e) cause
such a Registration Statement or other filing with the SEC to become or remain
effective or (f) take any similar actions or actions related thereto
(including entering into agreements and actions related to the marketing of
securities) (collectively, " _Registration Actions_ ") upon (i) the issuance
by the SEC of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of any such
Registration Statement or the initiation of proceedings with respect to
such a Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the Securities
Act, (ii) the Board of Directors determination, in its good faith judgment,
that any such Registration Action should not be taken because it would
reasonably be expected to materially interfere with or require the public
disclosure of any material corporate development or plan, including any
material financing, securities offering, acquisition, disposition, corporate
reorganization or merger or other transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) the Company possessing material non-public
information the disclosure of which the Board of Directors determines, in its
good faith judgment, would reasonably be expected to not be in the best
interests of the Company. Upon the occurrence of any of the conditions
described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above in connection with undertaking a
Registration Action, the Company shall give prompt notice of such suspension
(and whether such action is being taken pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
above) (a " _Suspension Notice_ ") to the Holders. Upon the termination of
such condition, the Company shall give prompt notice thereof to the Holders
and shall promptly proceed with all Registration Actions that were suspended
pursuant to this paragraph. The Company may only suspend Registration Actions
pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) above on two occasions during

 



14

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 any period of twelve (12) consecutive months for a reasonable time specified
in the Suspension Notice but not exceeding an aggregate of ninety (90) days
(which period may not be extended or renewed) during such twelve (12)
consecutive month period (each such occasion, a " _Suspension Period_ "). Each
Suspension Period shall be deemed to begin on the date the relevant Suspension
Notice is given to the Holders and shall be deemed to end on the earlier to
occur of (x) the date on which the Company gives the Holders a notice that the
Suspension Period has terminated and (y) the date on which the number of days
during which a Suspension Period has been in effect exceeds the 90-day limit
during such twelve (12) consecutive month period. If the filing of any Demand
Registration or Shelf Registration is suspended pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 2.6_, once the Suspension Period ends the Holders requesting such
registration may request a new Demand Registration or Shelf Registration (and
any such request for a Demand Registration shall not be counted as
an additional Demand Registration for purposes of Section 2.1.1).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 2_, the
Company shall not be in breach of, or have failed to comply with, any
obligation under this  _Section_ __ _ 2_ where the Company acts or omits to
take any action in order to comply with applicable Law, any SEC Guidance or
any Order. Each Holder shall keep confidential the fact that a Suspension
Period is in effect unless otherwise notified by the Company, except (a) for
disclosure to the Registration Participants or Holders, as applicable, and
their employees, agents and professional advisers who reasonably need to know
such information for purposes of assisting such Registration Participants or
Holders with respect to its investment in the Common Stock and agree to keep
it confidential, (b) for disclosures to the extent required in order to comply
with reporting obligations to its limited partners or other direct or
indirect investors who are subject to confidentiality arrangements with such
Holder, (c) if and to the extent such matters are publicly disclosed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that, to the actual
knowledge of such Holder, was not subject to an obligation or duty of
confidentiality to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (d) as required by
applicable Law (provided, that the Holder gives prior written notice to the
Company of such requirement and the contents of the proposed disclosure to
the extent it is permitted to do so under applicable Law), and (e) for
disclosure to any other Holder who is subject to the foregoing confidentiality
requirement.

 

2.7 _Lock-up Agreements_.

 

2.7.1 Each Holder owning Registrable Securities representing beneficial
ownership of 1% or more of the outstanding Common Stock (calculation of the
beneficial ownership of Registrable Securities shall not include any unvested
Earnout Shares or any shares of Common Stock to be issued for any Convertible
Notes) hereby agrees that, in connection with an Underwritten Offering, except
for sales in such Underwritten Offering:

(i) it will not effect any public sale or distribution (including sales
pursuant to Rule 144 and pursuant to derivative transactions) of Common Stock
in connection with an Underwritten Offering that is being made pursuant to a
Demand Registration Statement, a Shelf Registration Statement or a Piggyback
Registration, in each case in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2_, during
(A) the period commencing on the seventh (7th) day prior to the expected time
of circulation of a preliminary prospectus with respect to such Underwritten
Offering (or, if no preliminary prospectus is circulated, the commencement of
any marketing efforts with respect to such Underwritten Offering) and ending
on the ninetieth (90th) day following the date of the final prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities in connection with such Underwritten
Offering or (B) such shorter period as the Underwriters with respect to such
Underwritten Offering may require; provided, that the duration of the
restrictions described in this clause (i) shall be no longer than the
duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed by the Underwriters on
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company (or
Persons in substantially equivalent positions) in connection with
such Underwritten Offering; and

(ii) it will execute a lock-up agreement in favor of the Underwriters in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Underwriters to
such effect.

2.7.2 In connection with an Underwritten Offering, except for sales in such
Underwritten Offering, the Company (and its directors and officers) agrees
that it:

(i) shall not effect any public sale or distribution of Common Stock or
securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock (except pursuant
to registrations on Form S-8 or Form S-4 or any similar or successor form
under the Securities Act) during (A) the period commencing on the seventh
(7th) day prior to the expected time of circulation of a preliminary
prospectus with respect to such Underwritten Offering (or, if no
preliminary prospectus is circulated, the commencement of any marketing
efforts with respect to such Underwritten Offering) and ending on the
ninetieth (90th) day following the date of the final prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities in connection with such Underwritten Offering or (B)
such shorter period as the Underwriters with respect to such Underwritten
Offering may require; and

 

(ii) to the extent requested by the Underwriters participating in such
Underwritten Offering, it shall agree to include provisions in the relevant
underwriting or other similar agreement giving effect to the restrictions
described in clause (i) above, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such Underwriters.

 

2.8 _Limitations on Registration Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each of (i) Cowen Investments, Silverberg and Bernstein may not
exercise its or his rights under _Sections_ __ _ 2.1_ and _2.3_ hereunder
after five (5) and seven (7) years after the effective date of the
registration statement relating to the Companys initial public offering,
respectively, and (ii) Cowen Investments, Silverberg and Bernstein may not
exercise its or his rights under _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ more than one time.

 

3\. _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_. Whenever the Holders of Registrable Securities
have requested that any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to this
Agreement, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and the sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, and, in connection with
any such request:

3.1 The Company shall, as soon as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC
a Registration Statement on the form required by the applicable Subsection of
_Section_ __ _ 2_ under which such Registration Statement is required to be
filed, which form shall be available, pursuant to SEC Guidance, for the sale
of the Registrable Securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with
the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such filed Registration Statement to become and
remain effective, to the extent permitted by SEC Guidance, for a period of (i)
not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days (or, if sooner, until all
Registrable Securities have been sold under such Registration Statement),
which duration shall not count any Suspension Period, or (ii) in the case of a
Shelf Registration, until the earlier of the date (x) on which all of the
securities covered by such Shelf Registration are no longer
Registrable Securities and (y) on which the Company cannot extend the
effectiveness of such Shelf Registration because it is no longer S-3 Shelf
Eligible.

 

3.2 Prior to filing a Registration Statement or related prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto (including any documents incorporated by
reference therein), or before using any Free Writing Prospectus, the Company
shall provide to each Holder, the Holders Counsel and each Underwriter, if
any, with an adequate and appropriate opportunity to review and comment
on such Registration Statement, each Prospectus included therein (and each
amendment or supplement thereto) and each Free Writing Prospectus proposed to
be filed with the SEC, and thereafter the Company shall furnish to such
Holder, the Holders Counsel and Underwriter, if any, such number of copies
of such Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto filed
with the SEC (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary
prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424, Rule 430A, Rule
430B or Rule 430C under the Securities Act and such other documents as such
Holder or Underwriter may reasonably request in order to

 



16

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Holder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be required to
provide to any Person any materials, information or document required to be
filed by the Company pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to its filing other
than in connection with a Public Offering (other than as provided in this
Agreement). In addition, the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable,
keep the Holders advised in writing as to the initiation and progress of any
registration under _Sections 2.1_ , _2.2_ or _2.3_ and provide each Holder
with copies of all correspondence (including any comment letter) with the SEC
or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any such Registration
Statement. Each Holder shall have the right to request that the Company modify
any information contained in such Registration Statement, amendment
and supplement thereto pertaining to such Holder, and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such request; provided,
however, that the Company shall not have any obligation so to modify any
information if such modification the Company reasonably expects that so doing
would cause the relevant document to contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

3.3 After the filing of the Registration Statement, the Company shall (i)
cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus
supplement, and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under
the Securities Act, (ii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and
other SEC Guidance applicable to the Company with respect to the disposition
of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement during
the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition
by the Holder thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement
to such prospectus and (iii) promptly notify each Holder holding Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement and the Holders Counsel any
stop order issued or threatened by the SEC or any state securities commission
with respect thereto and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered.

 

3.4 The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register
or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United
States as any Holder holding such Registrable Securities reasonably (in light

time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, upon the discovery that, or upon the occurrence of an event as
a result of which, the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus is required so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of
such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not include an untrue

order to make the statements in light of the circumstances under which they
were made not misleading and the Company shall promptly prepare and make

_Inspectors_ "), all financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the "

the information in such Records is or becomes available to the public other
than as a result of disclosure by any Inspector in violation
the confidentiality agreements or (vi) is or was independently developed by
any Inspector without the benefit of the information in such Records. Each

shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it or its Affiliates
for any other purpose, including as the basis for any market transactions in
any securities of the Company, unless and until such information is made
generally available to the public. Each Holder further agrees that, upon
learning that disclosure of such Records is sought in a court of competent
jurisdiction, it shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, give notice
to the Company and allow the Company, at its expense, to undertake
appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed confidential.

3.11 Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_,
such Holder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities

copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus from the Company or (ii)
further notice from the Company that distribution can proceed without an
amended or supplemented prospectus, and, in the circumstances described in
clause (i) above, if so directed by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to
the Company (or otherwise destroy and promptly certify in writing to such
destruction) all copies, other than any file copies then in such Holders
possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
at the time of receipt of such notice. If the Company shall give such notice,
the Company shall extend the period during which such registration statement
shall be maintained effective (including the period referred to in _Section_
__ _ 3.1_) by the number of days during the period from and including the
date of the giving of notice pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ to the date
when the Company shall (x) make available to such Holder a prospectus
supplemented or amended to conform with the requirements of _Section_ __ _
3.5_ or (y) deliver to such Holder the notice described in clause (ii) above.

3.12 The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to

Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has
become effective; (ii) of any request by the SEC or any other Governmental
Authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement, a related
prospectus (including a Free Writing Prospectus) or for any other additional

respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification
of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the
initiation or threatening of any proceedings for such purpose.

Underwriter participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities
and their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be
made by FINRA.

3.16 The Company shall take all other steps reasonably necessary to effect

3.19 _Holder Obligations_.

 

3.19.1 If Registrable Securities owned by any Holder are included in a Demand
Registration Statement, a Shelf Registration Statement or a Piggyback
Registration, such Holder shall furnish promptly to the Company such
information regarding itself and the distribution of such Registrable
Securities by such Holder as is required under SEC Guidance or as the Company
may otherwise from time to time reasonably request in writing.

3.19.2 Each Holder that has requested inclusion of its Registrable Securities
in any Registration Statement shall (i) furnish to the Company (as a
condition precedent to such Holders participation in such registration) in
writing such information with respect to such Holder, its ownership of Common
Stock and the intended method of disposition of its Registrable Securities as
the Company may reasonably request or as may be required by SEC Guidance for
use in connection with any related Registration Statement or prospectus (or
amendment or supplement thereto) and any Free Writing Prospectus related
thereto and all information required to be disclosed in order to make the
information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not cause such
Registration Statement, prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus (A) to fail to
comply with SEC Guidance or (B) contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) comply with SEC
Guidance and all applicable state securities laws and comply with all
applicable regulations in connection with the registration and the disposition
of Registrable Securities.

 

3.19.3 Each Holder shall, as promptly as practicable, to the extent it is a
Registration Participant in a Registration Statement, following its actual
knowledge thereof, notify the Company of the occurrence of any event that
would reasonably be expected to cause a Registration Statement or prospectus
in which its Registrable Securities or any related Free Writing Prospectus
are included, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading.

 

3.19.4 Each Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Company in preparing the applicable Registration Statement to the extent
it is a Registration Participant and any related prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus.

3.19.5 Each Holder agrees that no Holder shall be entitled to sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or to receive a
prospectus relating thereto unless such Holder has complied with its
obligations hereunder.

 

3.20 _Registration Expenses_. In connection with the Company performing its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 2_, the Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by the Company, including all registration,
filing, and qualification fees; printers and accounting fees; fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company; and the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one counsel for the Holders of Registrable Securities that
are included in such Registration whether or not such Registration becomes
effective or such Registration or other transaction is completed; provided,
however that the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any
Registration proceeding if the request for such Registration is subsequently
withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities to be registered in such Registration. It is acknowledged by the
Holders that the Holders shall bear incremental selling expenses relating to
the sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters commissions and
discounts, in proportion to the number of Registrable Securities sold by each
such selling Holder.

4\. _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

 

4.1 _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder holding Registrable Securities
covered by a Registration Statement, its Affiliates,

 



20

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 stockholders, employees, agents, officers, partners, members, and directors,
and each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) (collectively the "
_Holder Parties_ "), for whom Registrable Securities are to be registered
pursuant to this Article II against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable
attorneys, accountants and experts fees and expenses) (" _Damages_ ")
caused by or relating to (A) any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or any
documents incorporated by reference therein, or any Free Writing Prospectus
utilized in connection therewith; (B) any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; or (C) any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact in the information conveyed to any
purchaser at the time of the sale to such purchaser, or the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein, and will reimburse each such Holder Party for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating
or defending any such Damages or in related actions or proceedings, except, in
each case, insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information
regarding such holder furnished in writing to the Company by such holder
expressly for use therein. The Company also agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless any Underwriters of the Registrable Securities (including any Holders
who is deemed to be an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of
the Securities Act), their respective officers and directors and each Person
who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act on substantially the same
basis as that of the indemnification of the Holders provided in this _Section_
__ _ 4.1_.

4.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder for whom
Registrable Securities are to be registered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2_ is
participating, each such Holder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, indemnify (i) the Company, (ii) each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (iii) each other Holder participating in
any offering of Registrable Securities and (iv) the respective partners,
Affiliates, stockholders, members, officers, directors, employees and agents
of each of the Persons specified in clauses (i) through (v), from and against
all Damages to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company
resulting from or relating to (A) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus, or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
Free Writing Prospectus utilized in connection therewith; (B) any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading; or (C) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact in the information conveyed to any
purchaser at the time of the sale to such purchaser, or the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein, but only to the extent, in each such case, that such untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is contained in
any information or affidavit regarding such holder so furnished in writing by
such Holder expressly for use therein; provided, that the obligation to
indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each Holder and
shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such Holder from
the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
As a condition to including Registrable Securities in any Registration
Statement filed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2_, the Company may require
that it shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from
any Underwriter to indemnify and hold it harmless to the extent customarily
provided by Underwriters with respect to similar securities and offerings. No
Holder shall be liable under this  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ for any Damages in
excess of the net proceeds realized by such Holder in the sale of Registrable
Securities of such Holder to which such Damages relate.

 

4.3 If any proceeding (including any investigation by any Governmental
Authority) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of
which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_ , such
Person (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Person against
whom such indemnity may be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing
and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and
shall assume the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses; provided, that
the failure of any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except
to the extent that the

 



21

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to notify. In
any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its
own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel
or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party (A)
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them or (B) there would be
rights or defenses that would be available to such Indemnified Party that are
not available to the Indemnifying Party. It is understood that, in connection
with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time
for all such Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be
reimbursed promptly after receipt of an invoice setting forth such fees and
expenses in reasonable detail. In the case of any such separate firm for the
Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the
Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if
settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,
the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party from and against any Damages (to the extent obligated herein) by reason
of such settlement or judgment. Without the prior written consent of each
affected Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party shall effect any settlement
of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified
Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such proceeding.

 

4.4 If the indemnification provided for in _Sections 4.1_ or _4.2_ is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to the Indemnified
Parties or is insufficient in respect of any Damages, then each Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
Damages in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties in connection with such
actions which resulted in such Damages, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Parties shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Parties and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such action. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. The amount
paid or payable by a party as a result of the Damages referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 4.1_
or _4.2_ , any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by a party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4_, no Holder shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds (after
deducting the Underwriters discounts and commissions) received by such Holder
in the offering. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. Each Holders obligation to contribute pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4_ is several in the proportion that the proceeds of the
offering received by such Holder bears to the total proceeds of the offering
received by all such Holders and not joint. The indemnification provided for
under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer,
director, or controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall survive
the transfer of securities. The Company also agrees to make such provisions,
as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party, for contribution to
such party in the event the Companys indemnification is unavailable for any
reason.

 

4.5 _Survival_. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each 

 



22

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also agrees to
make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party for
contribution to such party in the event the Companys or such Holders
indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

5\. _UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION_. 

5.1 _Rule 144_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
file any reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, and it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such
further action as any holder may reasonably request to make available adequate
current public information with respect to the Company meeting the current
public information requirements of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act, to
the extent required to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities
without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such
Rule may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of
its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.

assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by

such capacity) shall require the consent of the Holder(s) so affected. No
course of dealing between any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto
or any failure or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising
any rights or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any
rights or remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise

obligations or acts shall be deemed a waiver or extension of the time for
performance of any other obligations or acts.

6.9 _Remedies Cumulative_. In the event that the Company fails to observe or
perform any covenant or agreement to be observed or performed under this
Agreement, the Investors or any other holder of Registrable Securities may
proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity or action at law,
whether for specific performance of any term contained in this Agreement or
for an injunction against the breach of any such term or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement or to enforce any other legal
or equitable right, or to take any one or more of such actions, without being
required to post a bond. None of the rights, powers or remedies conferred
under this Agreement shall be mutually exclusive, and each such right, power
or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right, power
