they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Seller Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Seller Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Sellers or
Buyer or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of the Buyer set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the

date that is five trading days prior to the date of conversion. As used herein, the term &#147;<U>VWAP</U>&#148; means, for any trading day, the volume weighted average trading price of the Common Stock for such trading day on the NYSE (or if the

certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which Payee shall be entitled on such conversion (bearing such legends as may be required by applicable state and federal securities laws in the opinion of legal counsel for
Maker). Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the applicable conversion date set forth in Section&nbsp;4 above, regardless of whether the Note has been surrendered on such date, provided that
Maker shall not be required to issue a certificate for shares to Payee prior to the surrender of this Note. No fractional shares will be issued on conversion of this Note; in lieu of any fractional share to which Payee would otherwise be entitled,
Maker shall pay to Payee the amount of the outstanding principal balance and/or accrued interest due that is not so converted, such payment to be in cash or by check. Payee understands that Payee shall not have any of the rights of a stockholder
with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any principal or accrued interest of this Note, until such principal or accrued interest is converted into capital stock of Maker as provided herein. </P>
