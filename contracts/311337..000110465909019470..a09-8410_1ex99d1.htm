give prior oral or written notice to the other Party, and if such prior
notice is not possible, to give such notice immediately following the making

release with respect to this Agreement as soon as practicable after its due
execution.

  



  

 **2.12** ** ****_U.S. Securities Laws_**

  



  

The issuance of Amalco Shares under the Arrangement qualifies in the United

the U.S. Securities Act. Each Party agrees to act in good faith, consistent
with the intent of the Parties and the intended treatment of the Arrangement
as set forth in this Section 2.12.

Each Party agrees that:

  



  

(a) following approval of the Arrangement at the Suncor Shareholders Meeting
and the Petro-Canada Shareholders Meeting, and prior to the Effective Date,
it shall take all steps necessary to exercise any discretion provided under
or, to the extent required, to amend the Suncor Incentive Compensation Plans,
in the case of Suncor, and the Petro-Canada Incentive Compensation Plans, in
the case of Petro-Canada, and all other similar equity-based compensation
plans, as applicable, to provide: (i) for the adjustment, conversion or
exchange of units, rights or similar interests (" **Phantom Share Rights**
") granted under such plans to correspond with changes to Suncor Shares
or Petro-Canada Shares, as the case may be, as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement; and (ii) that the determination
of the value of Phantom Share Rights granted under such plans shall,
immediately following the Effective Time, be determined with reference to the
common shares of Amalco, based on the Suncor Exchange Ratio and Petro-Canada
Exchange Ratio, as the case may be;

  



        
   

  



  

(b) any Phantom Share Rights granted by Suncor and outstanding as at the
Effective Time and any Phantom Share Rights granted by Petro-Canada and
outstanding as at the Effective Time shall survive the Arrangement and,
except to the extent such Phantom Share Rights are adjusted or amended as
contemplated in this Section 5.8, shall continue to vest in accordance with,
and be subject to the terms and conditions of, the plan under which such
Phantom Share Rights were granted;

  



  

(c) the obligations of Suncor in respect of any Phantom Share Rights granted
by Suncor and outstanding as at the Effective Time and the obligations of
Petro-Canada in respect of any Phantom Share Rights granted by Petro-Canada
and outstanding as at the Effective Time shall continue to be obligations of
Amalco immediately following the Effective Time, as adjusted or amended as
contemplated in this Section 5.8; and

  



  

(d) following approval of the Arrangement at the Suncor Shareholders Meeting
and the Petro-Canada Shareholders Meeting, and prior to the Effective Date,
it shall take all steps necessary to exercise any discretion provided under,
or to the extent required, to amend the Suncor Stock Option Plans, in the
case of Suncor, and the Petro-Canada Stock Option Plan, in the case of Petro-
Canada, to provide that immediately following the Effective Time:

  



  

(i) each Suncor Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall be exchanged
with Amalco for a Replacement Option to purchase that number of Amalco Shares
equal to the product of the Suncor Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of
Suncor Shares subject to such Suncor Option and at an exercise price per
Amalco Share equal to the exercise price per Suncor Share subject to such
Suncor Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Suncor
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest penny. If the foregoing
calculation results in a Replacement Option being exercisable for a fraction
of an Amalco Share, then the number of Amalco Shares subject to such
Replacement Option shall be rounded down to the next whole number of Amalco
Shares and the total exercise price for the Replacement Option will be
reduced by the exercise price of the fractional Amalco Share. The term to
expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, vesting schedule, and
all other terms and conditions of such Replacement Option shall be the same
as the Suncor Option for which it was exchanged, as adjusted to take into
account the Arrangement pursuant to the terms of the applicable Suncor Stock
Option Plan; and

  



  

(ii) each Petro-Canada Option outstanding at the Effective Time shall be
exchanged with Amalco for a Replacement Option to purchase that number of
Amalco Shares equal to the product of the Petro-Canada Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the number of Petro-Canada Shares subject to such Petro-Canada
Option and at an exercise price per Amalco Share equal to the exercise price
per Petro-Canada Share subject to such Petro-Canada Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by the Petro-Canada Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest penny.  If the foregoing calculation results in a Replacement
Option being exercisable for a fraction of an Amalco Share, then the number
of Amalco Shares subject to such Replacement Option shall be rounded down to
the next whole number of Amalco Shares and the total exercise price for the
Replacement Option will be reduced by the exercise price of the fractional
Amalco Share. The term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising,
vesting schedule, and all other terms and conditions of such Replacement
Option shall be the same as the Petro-Canada Option for which it was
exchanged, as adjusted to take into

  



        
   

  



  

account the Arrangement pursuant to the terms of the Petro-Canada Stock
Option Plan.

  



  

 **5.9** ** _No Change of Control Payments_**

  



  

The Parties acknowledge that the Arrangement will not result in a "change of
control" or any other form of accelerated vesting for the purposes of the
Suncor Incentive Compensation Plans, the Suncor Stock Option Plans, the
Petro-Canada Incentive Compensation Plans and the Petro-Canada Stock Option
Plan and any executive employment or change of control agreements applicable
to any employees or the directors of the Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries or any other employment or consulting services agreement,
incentive, bonus or similar plan.

intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party
specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, inaccuracies of

the Party subject to the Acquisition Proposal to act in a manner consistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (a " **Superior Proposal**
"); and

appropriate disclosure with respect thereto to its securityholders; and

  



  

(g) accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a
Superior Proposal from a third party, but only if prior to such acceptance,
recommendation, approval or implementation, (i) the board of directors of the
Party subject to the Superior Proposal concludes in good faith, after
considering all proposals to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as contemplated by Section 7.1(3) and after receiving the advice of
outside counsel as reflected in minutes of the board of directors of such
Party, that the taking of such action is necessary for such board of
directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, (ii) such Party complies with its obligations set forth in
Section 7.1(3) and (iii) such Party terminates this Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.1(f), and concurrently therewith pays the amount required by
Section 7.2 to the other Party.

  



  

(3) Following receipt of a Superior Proposal, the Party subject to such
Superior Proposal shall give the other Party, orally and in writing, at least
72 hours advance notice of any decision by the board of directors of the
Party subject to such Superior Proposal to accept, recommend, approve or
enter into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
confirm that such board of directors has determined that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall identify the third party
making the Superior Proposal and shall provide a true and complete
copy thereof, including all financing documents, and any amendments thereto.
During such 72 hour period, the Party subject to such Superior Proposal
agrees not to accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to
implement such Superior Proposal and not to release the party making the
Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall not withdraw,
redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect of the Arrangement.
In addition, during such 72 hour period the Party subject to such Superior
Proposal shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to,
negotiate in good faith with the other Party and its financial and legal
advisors to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable the Party subject to such
Superior Proposal to proceed with

  



        
   

  



  

the Arrangement as amended rather than the Superior Proposal. In the event
the other Party proposes to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement on a
basis such that the board of directors of the Party subject to the Superior
Proposal determines that the proposed transaction is no longer a Superior
Proposal and so advises the board of directors of the other Party prior to
the expiry of such period, the board of directors of the Party subject to
such Acquisition Proposal shall not accept, recommend, approve or enter into
any agreement to implement such Acquisition Proposal and shall not release
the party making the Acquisition Proposal from any standstill provisions and
shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in respect
of the Arrangement. In the event that a Party provides the notice
contemplated by this Section 7.1(3) on a date which is less than five
business days prior to the Suncor Shareholders Meeting or the Petro-Canada
Shareholders Meeting, the other Party shall be entitled to (a) adjourn or
postpone its shareholders meeting and (b) require the Party subject to the
Superior Proposal to adjourn or postpone its shareholders meeting, in each
case to a date that is not more than ten **** business days after the date of
such notice.

  



  

(4) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors
of any Party from withdrawing, modifying, qualifying or changing its
recommendation to its shareholders in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the approval of the Arrangement by such
shareholders, if the board of directors of such Party determines, in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor(s) and
after receiving written advice of outside counsel), that such
withdrawal, modification, qualification or change is necessary for the board
of directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; provided that (a) not less than 48 hours before the board of
directors considers any proposal in respect of any such withdrawal,
modification, qualification or change, such Party shall give the other Party
written notice of such proposal and promptly advise the other Party of the
proposed consideration of such proposal; and (b) the foregoing shall not
relieve a Party from its obligation to proceed to call and hold the
applicable shareholders meeting and to hold the vote on the Arrangement
Resolution (provided that, except as required under applicable Laws, such
Party shall be relieved from its obligations to actively solicit proxies in
favour of the Arrangement in such circumstances), except in circumstances
where this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

(5) Each Party shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 7.1 applicable to such Party. Each Party shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 7.1 by such Partys
Representatives.

  



  

 **7.2** ** ****_Agreement as to Damages_**

  



  

If at any time after the execution of this Agreement:

  



  

(a) the board of directors of one Party has withdrawn, modified, qualified or
changed any of its recommendations or determinations referred to in Section
2.2 or Section 2.3, as applicable, (including, for greater certainty, in the
circumstances contemplated by Section 7.1(4)) in a manner adverse to the
other Party or shall have resolved to do so prior to the Effective Date, or
has failed to publicly reconfirm any such recommendation upon the request of
the other Party prior to the earlier of ten days following such request or 72
hours prior to the applicable shareholders meeting (unless the Party
requesting such reconfirmation is then in material breach of its obligations
hereunder and such withdrawal, change or failure relates to such breach);

  



  

(b) a _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed,
offered or made to the shareholders of a Party or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention to make

  



        
   

  



  

a _bona fide_  Acquisition Proposal in respect of a Party and, after such
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known, made or announced, Suncor
Shareholders (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal in respect of Suncor) or
Petro-Canada Shareholders (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal in respect
of Petro-Canada), as the case may be, do not approve the Arrangement or vote
upon the Arrangement Resolution, **** and such Acquisition Proposal or an
amended version thereof relating to Suncor or Petro-Canada, as the case
may be, is consummated or effected as applicable within six months of the
date the first Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, proposed, offered
or made; and for the purpose of this paragraph the references in the
definition of " **Acquisition Proposal** " to "20% or more of the
voting securities" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more of the
voting securities", and the references to "a substantial amount of assets"
shall be deemed to be references to "all or substantially all of the assets";

  



  

(c) the board of directors of a Party accepts, recommends, approves or enters
into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal; or

  



  

(d) a Party is in breach of any of its covenants made in this Agreement,
which breach individually or in the aggregate causes or would reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Change with respect to such Party or
materially impedes or would reasonably be expected to materially impede the
completion of the Arrangement, and such Party fails to cure such breach
within 10 business days after receipt of written notice thereof from
the other Party;

  



  

(each of the above being a " **Damages Event** ") then in the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 as a result thereof,
(i) if Suncor is the subject of any of the foregoing events, it shall pay to
Petro-Canada, within two business days of the first to occur of the
foregoing, a fee in the amount of $300 million as liquidated damages in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Petro-Canada and (ii)
if Petro-Canada is the subject of any of the foregoing events, it shall pay
to Suncor, within two business days of the first to occur of the foregoing, a
fee in the amount of $300 million as liquidated damages in immediately
available funds to an account designated by Suncor, and after such event but
prior to payment of such amount, the Party required to make such payment
shall be deemed to hold such funds in trust for the other Party; provided
that in the case of a Damages Event pursuant to Section 7.2(c) such payment
shall be made by a Party to the other Party concurrently with the acceptance,
recommending, approving or entering into of the Superior Proposal by such
Party. Suncor shall only be obligated to pay a maximum of $300 million
pursuant to this Section 7.2 and Petro-Canada shall only be obligated to pay
a maximum of $300 million pursuant to this Section 7.2.

  



  

 **7.3** ** ****_Fees and Expenses_**

  



  

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), each Party shall pay all fees, costs
and expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Agreement and the
Arrangement. Suncor and Petro-Canada shall share equally any filing fees and
applicable Taxes payable for or in respect of any application, notification
or other filing made in respect of any regulatory process in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Arrangement, including, without limiting the
generality thereof, under the Competition Act and the HSR Act.

  



  

(2) If (i) this Agreement is terminated because of the failure of the
condition in Section 6.2(a), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Suncor
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and at the time of such termination there is a
state of facts or circumstances that would cause the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) not to be satisfied, notwithstanding the
availability of any cure period, Petro-Canada shall pay Suncor an amount
equal to $20 million as reimbursement to Suncor for its out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the

  



        
   

  



  

Arrangement, provided that if Suncor is in material breach of its obligations
hereunder at the time of the termination of the Agreement such amount will
not be payable.

  



  

(3) If (i) this Agreement is terminated because of the failure of the
condition in Section 6.3(a), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Petro-
Canada pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and at the time of such termination there
is a state of facts or circumstances that would cause the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) not to be satisfied, notwithstanding the
availability of any cure period, Suncor shall pay Petro-Canada an amount
equal to $20 million as reimbursement to Petro-Canada for its out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the Arrangement, provided that if Petro-
Canada is in material breach of its obligations hereunder at the time of the
termination of the Agreement such amount will not be payable.

  



  

(4) No fees shall be payable by a Party under subsection (2) or (3) if that
Party has paid a fee under Section 7.2.

  



  

 **7.4** ** ****_Liquidated Damages_**

  



  

Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Article VII are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages which Suncor or Petro-Canada will suffer or incur as
a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant termination
of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are
excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that the
payment of any amounts pursuant to this Article VII is the sole monetary
remedy of Suncor and Petro-Canada; provided, however, that this limitation
shall not apply in the event of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by
a Party.

  



  

 **7.5** ** ****_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**

  



  

(1) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Date and the
termination of this Agreement, Petro-Canada shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, subject to all applicable Laws and in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other subsequent
written agreement that addresses confidentiality between the Parties, afford
to Suncor and the Representatives of Suncor complete access at all reasonable
times to their officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and
contracts (including permitting Suncors Representatives to attend Petro-
Canadas weekly operations meetings), and shall furnish Suncor with all data
and information as Suncor may reasonably request, subject to the conditions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and any other subsequent written
agreement that addresses confidentiality between the Parties, in order to
permit Suncor to be in a position to expeditiously and efficiently
integrate the businesses and operations of Suncor and Petro-Canada
immediately upon but not prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

(2) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Date and the
termination of this Agreement, Suncor shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Representatives to, subject to all applicable Laws and in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement and any other subsequent written agreement that
addresses confidentiality between the Parties, afford to Petro-Canada and to
the Representatives of Petro-Canada complete access at all reasonable times
to their officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and
contracts (including permitting Petro-Canadas Representatives to attend
Suncors weekly operations meetings), and shall furnish Petro-Canada with all
data and information as Petro-Canada may reasonably request, subject to the
conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and any
other subsequent written agreement that addresses confidentiality

  



        
   

  



  

between the Parties, in order to permit Petro-Canada to be in a position to
expeditiously and efficiently integrate the businesses and operations of
Suncor and Petro-Canada immediately upon but not prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

 **7.6** ** ****_Insurance and Indemnification_**

  



  

(1) Suncor and Petro-Canada agree that Amalco will maintain in effect without
any reduction in scope or coverage for six years from the Effective Date
customary policies of directors and officers liability insurance providing
protection comparable to the most favourable protection provided by the
policies maintained by Suncor and Petro-Canada and their respective
Subsidiaries as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date and
providing coverage on a "trailing" or "run-off" basis for all present and
former directors and officers of Suncor and Petro-Canada with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective
Date.

  



  

(2) Suncor and Petro-Canada agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favour of present and former officers and
directors of each of Suncor and Petro-Canada shall survive the Arrangement
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
years from the Effective Date.

  



  

 **7.7** ** ****_Financial Advisors_**

  



  

Suncor and Petro-Canada represent and warrant to each other that, except for
CIBC World Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Canada Limited in the case of
Suncor and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in
the case of Petro-Canada, no financial advisor, broker, finder or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission, or
to the reimbursement of any of its expenses, in connection with the
Arrangement. Each Party has provided to the other Party a correct and
complete copy of all agreements relating to the arrangements between it and
its financial advisors as are in existence at the date hereof and agrees (a)
not to amend the terms of any such agreements relating to the payment of fees
and expenses or indemnification without the prior written approval of the
other Party; and (b) not to disclose the terms of the agreements between the
other Party and its financial advisors to such Partys financial advisors.

  



  

 **ARTICLE VIII

postponement thereof) or Petro-Canada Shareholders Meeting (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof) in accordance with the Interim Order;

  



  

(c) by either Suncor or Petro-Canada if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to March 31, 2010, except that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any Party
whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date;

  



        
   

  



  

(d) as provided in Section 6.4; provided that the Party seeking termination
is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.1 or Sections 6.2 or 6.3, as applicable, not to be
satisfied;

  



  

(e) by either Suncor or Petro-Canada upon the occurrence of a Damages Event
in respect of the other Party as provided in Section 7.2; or

into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section

 **8.2** ** ****_Effect of Termination_**

  



  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set

Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, except to the extent specified therein.

  



  

 **8.3** ** ****_Amendment_**

amended by mutual written agreement of the Parties, subject to the Interim
Order and Final Order and applicable Laws.

  



  

 **8.4** ** ****_Waiver_**

  



  

Either Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive compliance with any
of the other Partys agreements or the fulfillment of any conditions to its
own obligations contained herein, and (c) waive inaccuracies in any of the
other Partys representations or warranties contained herein or in any

the specific matters identified in such instrument.

 ** **

  

 **9.2** ** ****_Entire Agreement; Binding Effect_**

  



  

This Agreement: (a) together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other
subsequent written agreement that addresses confidentiality between the
Parties, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) shall be binding upon and
enure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  



  

 **9.3** ** ****_Assignment_**

  



  

Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
either of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
Party.

  



  

 **9.4** ** ****_Time of Essence_**

  



  

Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

  



  

 **9.5** ** ****_Further Assurances_**

  



  

Each Party hereto shall, from time to time and at all times hereafter, at the
request of the other Party hereto, but without further consideration, do all
such further acts, and execute and deliver all such further documents and
instruments as may be reasonably required in order to fully perform and carry
out the terms and intent hereof.

  



  

 **9.6** ** ****_Specific Performance_**

  



  

Suncor and Petro-Canada agree that irreparable harm would occur for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or any
other subsequent written agreement that addresses confidentiality between the
Parties were not performed by the other Party in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each
Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or any other subsequent written
agreement that addresses confidentiality between the Parties or to otherwise
obtain specific performance of any such provisions, any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived.

  



  

 **9.7** ** ****_Third Party Beneficiaries_**

  



  

The provisions of Sections 5.5(3) and 7.6 are: (a) intended for the benefit
of all present and former directors and officers of Suncor and Petro-Canada
and their respective Subsidiaries, as and to the extent applicable in
accordance with their terms, and shall be enforceable by each of such Persons
and his or her heirs, executors administrators and other legal
representatives (collectively, the "Third Party Beneficiaries") and Suncor
and Petro-Canada shall hold the rights and benefits of Sections 5.5(3) and
7.6 in trust for and on behalf of the Third Party Beneficiaries and each of
Suncor and Petro-Canada hereby accepts such trust and agrees to hold the
benefit of and enforce performance of such covenants on behalf of the Third
Party Beneficiaries, and (b) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights that the Third Party Beneficiaries may have by contract or
otherwise. Except as provided in this Section 9.7, this Agreement shall not
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



        
   

  



  

 **9.8** ** ****_Governing Law_**

  



  

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada applicable therein, and the
Parties hereto irrevocably attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
Province of Alberta.

  



  

 **9.9** ** ****_Severability_**

  



  

If any one or more of the provisions or parts thereof contained in this
Agreement should be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions or parts thereof
contained herein shall be and shall be conclusively deemed to be, as to such
jurisdiction, severable therefrom and:

  



       

(a)

    |  

the validity, legality or enforceability of such  remaining provisions or
parts thereof shall not in any way be affected or  impaired by the severance
of the provisions or parts thereof severed; and

    
---|--- 
     



    |  



    
     

(b)

    |  

the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of  any provision or part
thereof contained in this Agreement in any jurisdiction  shall not affect or
impair such provision or part thereof or any other  provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction.

    
   



  

 **9.10** ** ****_Counterparts_**

in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together constitute one and the same instrument.

but in no case shall Amalco or any other Person be required to recognize such

in accordance with the Arrangement and will not be exchanged for Amalco

 **ARTICLE IV 
 CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SHARES**

  



  

 **4.1** ** ****Issuance of Certificates Representing Amalco Shares**

  



  

Upon surrender to the Depository for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more Suncor Shares
or Petro-Canada Shares that were converted into one or more Amalco Shares
under the Arrangement, together with such other documents and instruments as
would have been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly
represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Suncor or
Petro-Canada, as applicable, and such additional documents and instruments as
the Depository may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the
Depository shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that
number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of Amalco Shares which such
holder has the right to receive (together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2 and any cash in lieu of
fractional Amalco Shares pursuant to Section 4.3), and the certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of Suncor or Petro-Canada, as applicable, a certificate
representing the proper number of Amalco Shares may be issued to the
transferee if the certificate representing such Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada
Shares, as applicable, is presented to the Depository, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada Shares that were
converted into Amalco Shares shall be deemed at all times after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) the
certificate representing Amalco Shares as contemplated by this Section 4.1,
(ii) a cash payment in lieu of any fractional Amalco Shares as contemplated
by Section 4.3, and (iii) any dividends or distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid or payable with respect to Amalco
Shares as contemplated by Section 4.2.

  



  

 **4.2** ** ****Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates**

  



  

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Amalco Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Suncor Shares
or Petro-Canada Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(ii)(O),
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 4.3, unless and until the holder of record of such
certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with Section 4.1.
Subject to applicable Law, at the time of such surrender of any such
certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of record of the certificates
representing whole Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada Shares, without interest,
(i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Amalco Share to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.3, (ii) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Amalco Share, and (iii) on the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole Amalco Share,
as the case may be.

  



        
   

  



  

 **4.3** ** ****No Fractional Shares**

  



  

No certificates or scrip representing fractional Amalco Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to Section
4.1 and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital structure of
Amalco shall relate to any such fractional security and such fractional
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise any rights as a
security holder of Amalco. In lieu of any such fractional Amalco Shares, a
shareholder will receive an amount determined on the basis that each Amalco
Share has a value equal to the volume weighted average price for such shares
on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the first five trading days on which such
shares trade on such exchange immediately following the Effective Date.

  



  

 **4.4** ** ****Lost Certificates**

  



  

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada Shares that
were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(ii)(O) shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depository
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, cash
and/or one or more certificates representing one or more Amalco Shares (and
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2
and any cash pursuant to Section 4.3) deliverable in accordance with such
holders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for
any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom certificates
representing Amalco Shares are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Amalco and its transfer
agents in such sum as Amalco may direct or otherwise indemnify Amalco in a
manner satisfactory to Amalco against any claim that may be made against
Amalco with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  



  

 **4.5** ** ****Extinction of Rights**

  



  

Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada Shares that are exchanged pursuant
to Section 2.2(ii)(O) and not deposited with all other instruments required
by Section 4.1 on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date,
shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature as a
shareholder of Amalco. On such date, the Amalco Shares (or cash in lieu of
fractional interests therein, as provided in Section 4.3) to which the former
registered holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence
was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to Amalco,
together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions and interest
thereon held for such former registered holder.

  



  

 **4.6** ** ****Withholding Rights**

  



  

Amalco and the Depository shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Suncor Shares or
Petro-Canada Shares, such amounts as Amalco or the Depository are required or
permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax
Act, the U.S. Tax Code or any provision of provincial, state, local or
foreign Tax Law, in each case as amended. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the
amount so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld from any payment
to a holder exceeds the cash component, if any, of the consideration
otherwise payable to the holder, Amalco and the Depository are hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the Amalco Shares
otherwise issuable to the holder as is necessary to provide sufficient funds
to Amalco or the Depository, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with
such deduction or withholding

  



        
   

  



  

requirement and Amalco or the Depository shall notify the holder thereof and
remit the applicable portion of the net proceeds of such sale to the
appropriate taxing authority.

communicated to holders of the Shares if and as required by the Court.

  



  

(b) Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be proposed by Suncor or Petro-Canada at any time prior to the Suncor
Shareholders Meeting or Petro-Canada Shareholders Meeting (provided that
the other Party shall have consented thereto in writing) with or without any
other prior notice or communication, and if so proposed and accepted by the
Persons voting at the Suncor Shareholders Meeting or Petro-Canada
Shareholders Meeting (other than as may be required under the Interim
Order), shall become part of this Plan of Arrangement for all purposes.

  



  

(c) Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement
that is approved or directed by the Court following the Suncor Shareholders
Meeting or Petro-Canada Shareholders Meeting shall be effective only if (i)
it is consented to in writing by each of Suncor and Petro-Canada (in each
case, acting reasonably), and (ii) if required by the Court, it is consented
to by holders of the Suncor Shares or Petro-Canada Shares, as applicable,
voting in the manner directed by the Court.

  



  

(d) Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be made following the Effective Date unilaterally by Amalco, provided that it
concerns a matter which, in the reasonable opinion of Amalco, is of an
administrative nature required to better give effect to the implementation of
this Plan of Arrangement and is not adverse to the economic interest of any
former holder of Suncor Shares, Petro-Canada Shares, Suncor Options or Petro-
Canada Options.

subject to the rights of the holders of any other class of shares of Amalco
entitled to receive the property or assets of Amalco upon such a liquidation,

designation, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions to be attached
to the Senior Preferred Shares of such series, the whole subject to the

(the " **Act** ")) of Articles of Amendment containing a description of such

determined by the board of directors of Amalco.

The Senior Preferred Shares of each series shall rank on a parity with the

requirement that such approval be given by resolution signed by all the
holders of the Senior Preferred Shares or passed by the affirmative vote of
at least 2/3 of the votes cast at a meeting of the holders of the Senior

security only, in the aggregate voting shares to which are attached more than
twenty per cent (20%) of the votes that may ordinarily be cast to elect
directors of Amalco, other than votes that may be so cast by or on behalf of
the Minister.  (The foregoing prohibition is referred to in this Schedule B
as the "individual share constraint".)

  



  

2.2 In the event that it appears from the central securities register of
Amalco that any person, together with the associates of that person, is in
contravention of the individual share constraint:

  



  

(a) Amalco shall not accept any subscription for voting shares from

(b) Amalco shall not issue any voting shares to that person or any associate
of that person; and

  



  

(c) Amalco shall not register or otherwise recognize the transfer of
any voting shares to that person or any associate of that person.

  



  

2.3 In the event of a directors determination that any person, together with
the associates of that person, is in contravention of the individual share
constraint:

  



  

(a) Amalco shall not accept any subscription for voting shares from
that person or any associate of that person;

of the voting shares of that person or of any associate of that person;

  



  

(e) subject to subsection 9.1, Amalco shall not declare or pay any dividend,
and or make any other distribution:

  



  

(i) on any of the excess voting shares of that person or of any associate of
that person; or

  



  

(ii) if the directors of Amalco determine that the contravention of the
individual ownership constraint was intentional and that it would not be
inequitable to do so, on all of the voting shares of that person and of each
associate of that person;

  



  

and any entitlement to such dividend or other distribution shall be
forfeited; and

  



  

(f) Amalco shall send a sell-down notice to the registered holder of the
voting shares of that person and of each associate of that person.

  



        
   

  



  

2.4 In the event that it appears from the central securities register of
Amalco that, or in the event, of a directors determination that, any person,
together with the associates of that person, after any proposed subscription,
issue or transfer of voting shares, would be in contravention of the
individual share constraint, Amalco shall not:

  



  

(a) accept the proposed subscription for voting shares from;

person, together with the associates of that person, was in contravention of
the individual share constraint, the directors of Amalco may also determine
that:

  



  

(a) any votes cast, in person or by proxy, during that period in respect
of the voting shares of that person or of any associate of that person shall
be disqualified and deemed not to have been cast; and

  



  

(b) subject to subsection 9.1, each of that person and the associates of that
person is liable to Amalco to restore to Amalco the amount of any dividend
paid or distribution received during that period on:

  



  

(i) the excess voting shares of that person and of each associate of that
person; or

  



  

(ii) if the directors of Amalco determine that the contravention of the
individual ownership constraint was intentional and that it would not be
inequitable to do so, on all of the voting shares of that person and of each
associate of that person.

  



  

 **3.** Sell-Down Notice

  

 ** **

  

3.1 Any notice (a "sell-down notice") required to be sent to a registered
holder of voting shares pursuant to paragraph 2.3(f):

  



  

(a) shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of the contravention of the
individual share constraint, the number of voting shares determined to
be excess voting shares and the consequences of the contravention specified
in section 2;

  



  

(b) shall request an initial or further shareholders declaration;

  



  

(c) shall specify a date, which shall be not less than 45 days after the date
of the sell-down notice, by which the excess voting shares are to be sold or
disposed of; and

  



  

(d) shall state that unless the registered holder either:

  



  

(i) sells or otherwise disposes of the excess voting shares by the date
specified in the sell-down notice on a basis that does not result in any
contravention of the individual share constraint and provides to Amalco, in
addition to the shareholders declaration requested pursuant to paragraph
3.1(b), written evidence satisfactory to Amalco of such sale or other
disposition; or

  



         
 

  



  

(ii) provides to Amalco, in addition to the shareholders declaration
requested pursuant to paragraph 3.1(b), written evidence satisfactory to
Amalco that no such sale or other disposition of excess voting shares is
required;

  



  

such default (a "shareholder default") shall result in the consequence of
suspension pursuant to section 4 and may result in the consequence of sale in
accordance with section 5 or redemption in accordance with section 6, in each
case without further notice to the registered holder, and shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature and timing of those consequences.

  



  

3.2 In the event that, following the sending of a sell-down notice, written
evidence is submitted to Amalco for purposes of subparagraph 3.1(d)(ii),
Amalco shall assess the evidence as soon as is reasonably practicable and in
any event shall give a second notice to the person submitting the evidence
not later than 10 days after the receipt thereof stating whether the evidence
has or has not satisfied Amalco that no sale or other disposition of excess
voting shares is required. If the evidence has so satisfied Amalco,
such sell-down notice shall be cancelled and such second notice shall so
state. If the evidence has not so satisfied Amalco, such second notice shall
reiterate the statements required to be made in such sell-down notice
pursuant to paragraphs 3.1(c) and (d). In either case, the 45 day period
referred to in paragraph 3.1(c) shall be automatically extended to the end of
the 10 day period referred to in this section 3.2 if such 10 day
period extends beyond such 45 day period.

  



  

 **4.** Suspension

  

 ** **

  

4.1 In the event of a shareholder default in respect of any registered holder
of voting shares, then, without further notice to the registered holder:

  



  

(a) all of the voting shares of the registered holder shall be deemed to
be struck from the securities register of Amalco;

  



  

(b) no person may, in person or by proxy, exercise the right to vote any
of such voting shares;

  



  

(c) subject to subsection 9.1, Amalco shall not declare or pay any dividend,
or make any other distribution, on any of such voting shares and
any entitlement to such dividend or other distribution shall be forfeited;

  



  

(d) Amalco shall not send any form of proxy, information circular
or financial statements of Amalco or any other communication from Amalco to
any person in respect of such voting shares; and

  



  

(e) no person may exercise any other right or privilege ordinarily
attached to such voting shares.

  



  

(All of the foregoing consequences of a shareholder default are referred to
in this Schedule B as a "suspension".) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
registered holder of suspended voting shares shall have the right to transfer
such voting shares on any securities register of Amalco on a basis that does
not result in contravention of the individual share constraint.

  



  

4.2 The directors of Amalco shall cancel any suspension of voting shares of a
registered holder and reinstate the registered holder to the securities
register of Amalco for all purposes if they determine that, following the
cancellation and reinstatement, none of such voting shares will be held,
beneficially owned

  



        
   

  



  

or controlled in contravention of the individual share constraint. For greater
certainty, any such reinstatement shall permit, from and after the
reinstatement, the exercise of all rights and privileges attached to the
voting shares so reinstated but, subject to subsection 9.1, shall have no
retroactive effect.

  



  

 **5.** Sale

  

 ** **

  

5.1 In the event of a shareholder default in respect of any registered holder
of voting shares, Amalco may elect by directors determination to sell, on
behalf of the registered holder, the excess voting shares thereof, without
further notice thereto, on the terms set forth in this section 5 and section
7.

  



  

5.2 Amalco may sell any excess voting shares in accordance with this section
5:

  



  

(a) on the principal stock exchange; or

  



  

(b) if there is no principal stock exchange, on such other stock exchange or
organized market on which the voting shares are then listed or traded as
the directors of Amalco shall determine; or

  



  

(c) if the voting shares are not then listed on any stock exchange or traded
on any organized market, in such other manner as the directors of
Amalco shall determine.

  



  

5.3 The net proceeds of sale of excess voting shares sold in accordance with
this section 5 shall be the net proceeds after deduction of any commission,
tax or other cost of sale.

  



  

5.4 For all purposes of a sale of excess voting shares in accordance with
this section, Amalco is the agent and lawful attorney of the registered
holder and the beneficial owner of the excess voting shares.

  



  

 **6.** Redemption

  

 ** **

  

6.1 In the event of a shareholder default in respect of any registered holder
of voting shares and in the event that the directors of Amalco determine
either that Amalco has used reasonable efforts to sell excess voting shares
in accordance with section 5 but that such sale is impracticable or that it
is likely that such sale would have material adverse consequences to Amalco
or the holders of voting shares, Amalco may elect by directors
determination, subject to applicable law, to redeem the excess voting shares
thereof, without further notice thereto, on the terms set forth in this
section 6 and section 7.

  



  

6.2 The redemption price paid by Amalco to redeem any excess voting shares in
accordance with this section 6 shall be:

  



  

(a) the average of the closing prices per share of the voting shares on
the principal stock exchange (or, if there is no principal stock exchange or
if the requisite trading of voting shares has not occurred on the principal
stock exchange, such other stock exchange or such other organized market on
which such requisite trading has occurred as the directors of Amalco shall
determine) over the last 10 trading days on which at least one board lot of
voting shares has traded on the principal stock exchange (or such other stock
exchange or such other organized market) in the period ending on the trading
day immediately preceding the redemption date; or

  



  

(b) if the requisite trading of voting shares has not occurred on any
stock exchange or other organized market, on such basis as the directors of
Amalco shall determine.

  



        
   

  



  

 **7.** Procedures Relating to Sale and Redemption

  

 ** **

  

7.1 In the event of any sale or redemption of excess voting shares in
accordance with section 5 or 6, respectively, Amalco shall deposit an amount
equal to the amount of the net proceeds of sale or the redemption price,
respectively, in a special account in any bank or trust company in Canada
selected by it. The amount of the deposit, less the reasonable costs of
administration of the special account, shall be payable to the registered
holder of the excess voting shares sold or redeemed on presentation and
surrender by the registered holder to that bank or trust company of the
certificate or certificates representing the excess voting shares. Any
interest earned on any amount so deposited shall accrue to the benefit of
Amalco.

  



  

7.2 From and after any deposit made pursuant to subsection 7.1, the
registered holder shall not be entitled to any of the remaining rights of a
registered holder in respect of the excess voting shares sold or redeemed,
other than the right, to receive the funds so deposited on presentation and
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the excess voting
shares sold or redeemed.

  



  

7.3 If a part only of the voting shares represented by any certificate is
sold or redeemed in accordance with section 5 or 6, respectively, Amalco
shall, on presentation and surrender of such certificate and at the expense
of the registered holder, issue a new certificate representing the balance of
the voting shares.

  



  

7.4 So soon as is reasonably practicable after, and, in any event, not later
than 30 days after, a deposit made pursuant to subsection 7.1, Amalco shall
send a notice to the registered holder of the excess voting shares sold or
redeemed and the notice shall state:

  



  

(a) that a specified number of voting shares has been sold or redeemed,
as the case may be;

  



  

(b) the amount of the net proceeds of sale or the redemption
price, respectively;

  



  

(c) the name and address of the bank or trust company at which Amalco
has made the deposit of the net proceeds of sale or the redemption
price, respectively; and

  



  

(d) all other relevant particulars of the sale or redemption, respectively.

  



  

7.5 For greater certainty, Amalco may sell or redeem excess voting shares in
accordance with section 5 or 6, respectively, despite the fact that Amalco
does not possess the certificate or certificates representing the excess
voting shares at the time of the sale or redemption. If, in accordance
with section 5, Amalco sells excess voting shares without possession of
the certificate or certificates representing the excess voting shares, Amalco
shall issue to the purchaser of such excess voting shares or its nominee a
new certificate or certificates representing the excess voting shares sold.
lf, in accordance with section 5 or section 6, Amalco sells or redeems excess
voting shares without possession of the certificate or certificates
representing the excess voting shares and, after the sale or redemption, a
person establishes that it is a bona fide purchaser of the excess voting
shares sold or redeemed, then, subject to applicable law:

  



  

(a) the excess voting shares held or beneficially owned by the bona
fide purchaser are deemed to be, from the date of the sale or redemption by
Amalco, as the case may be, validly issued and outstanding voting shares in
addition to the excess voting shares sold or redeemed; and

  



        
   

  



  

(b) notwithstanding subsection 7.2, Amalco is entitled to the deposit made
pursuant to subsection 7.1 and, in the case of a sale in accordance with
section 5, shall add the amount of the deposit to the stated capital account
for the class of voting shares issued.

  



  

 **8.** Exceptions

  

 ** **

  

8.1 Notwithstanding section 2, the individual share constraint does not apply
in respect of voting shares of Amalco that are held:

  



  

(a) by the Minister in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada;

  



  

(b) by one or more underwriters solely for the purpose of distributing
the voting shares to the public; or

  



  

(c) by any person who provides centralized facilities for the clearing
of trades in securities and is acting in relation to trades in the voting
shares solely as an intermediary in the payment of funds or the delivery
of securities, or both.

  



  

 **9.** Saving Provisions

  

 ** **

  

9.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Schedule B:

  



  

(a) the directors of Amalco may determine to pay a dividend or to make
any other distribution on voting shares that would otherwise be prohibited by
any other provision of this Schedule B where the contravention of
the individual share constraint that gave rise to the prohibition was
inadvertent or of a technical nature or it would otherwise be inequitable not
to pay the dividend or make the distribution; and

  



  

(b) where a dividend has not been paid or any other distribution has not been
made on voting shares as a result of a directors determination of
a contravention of the individual share constraint, or where the amount of
a dividend or any other distribution has been restored to Amalco pursuant
to paragraph 2.5(b) as a result of a directors determination of
a contravention of the individual share constraint, the directors of Amalco
shall declare and pay the dividend, make the distribution, or refund the
restored amount, respectively, if they subsequently determine that no such
contravention occurred.

  



  

9.2 In the event that Amalco suspends or redeems voting shares in accordance
with section 4 or 6, respectively, or otherwise redeems, purchases for
cancellation or otherwise acquires voting shares, and the result of such
action is that any person and the associates of that person who, prior to
such action, were not in contravention of the individual share constraint
are, after such action, in contravention, then, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Schedule B, the sole consequence of such action to that
person and the associates of that person, in respect of the voting shares of
that person and of the associates of that person held, beneficially owned or
controlled at the time of such action, shall be that the number of votes
attached to those voting shares shall be reduced to a number that is the
largest whole number of votes that may be attached to the voting shares which
that person and the associates of that person could hold, beneficially own or
control from time to time in compliance with the individual share constraint.

  



  

9.3 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Schedule B, a contravention
of the individual share constraint shall have no consequences except those
that are expressly provided for in this Schedule B. For greater certainty
but without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  



        
   

  



  

(a) no transfer, issue or ownership of, and no title to, voting shares;

  



  

(b) no resolution of shareholders (except to the extent that the result
thereof is affected as a result of a directors determination under paragraph
2.5(a)); and

  



  

(c) no act of Amalco, including any transfer of property to or by Amalco;

  



  

shall be invalid or otherwise affected by any contravention of the individual
share constraint.

  



  

 **10.** Directors Determinations

  

 ** **

  

10.1 The directors of Amalco shall have the sole right and authority to
administer the provisions of this Schedule B and to make any determination
required or contemplated hereunder. In so acting, the directors of Amalco
shall enjoy, in addition to the powers set forth in this Schedule B, all of
the powers necessary or desirable, in their opinion, to carry out the intent
and purpose of this Schedule B. The directors of Amalco shall make on a
timely basis all determinations necessary for the administration of the
provisions of this Schedule B and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if the directors of Amalco consider that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that a contravention of the individual ownership
constraint has occurred or will occur, the directors shall make a
determination with respect to the matter. Any directors determination that is
not inconsistent with the _Petro-Canada Public Participation Act_ and other
applicable law shall be conclusive, final and binding except to the extent
modified by any subsequent directors determination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the directors of Amalco may delegate, in whole or in part:

  



  

(a) their power to make a directors determination in respect of
any particular matter to a committee of the board of directors; and

  



  

(b) any of their other powers under this Schedule B in accordance
with subsection 115(3) or paragraph 121(a) of the _Canada Business
Corporations Act_.

  



  

10.2 The directors of Amalco shall make any directors determination
contemplated by section 2:

  



  

(a) after the relevant shareholders declarations have been requested
and received by Amalco, only:

  



  

(i) on a basis consistent with those shareholders declarations; or

  



  

(ii) if the directors of Amalco are of the opinion that the shareholders
declarations do not contain adequate or accurate information and they believe
and have reasonable grounds for believing that they will not be provided with
shareholders declarations that do contain adequate and accurate information;
or

  



  

(b) whether or not any shareholders declaration has been requested
or received by Amalco, only if the directors of Amalco believe and have
reasonable grounds for believing that they have sufficient information to
make the directors determination, that the consequences of the directors
determination would not be inequitable to those affected by it and that it
would be impractical, under all the circumstances, to request or to await the
receipt of any shareholders declaration.

  



  

10.3 In administering the provisions of this Schedule B, including, without
limitation, in making any directors determination in accordance with
subsection 10.2 or otherwise, the directors of Amalco may

  



        
   

  



  

rely on any information on which the directors consider it reasonable to rely
in the circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
directors of Amalco may rely upon any shareholders declaration, the
securities register of Amalco, the knowledge of any director, officer or
employee of Amalco or any advisor to Amalco and the opinion of counsel to
Amalco.

  



  

10.4 In administering the provisions of this Schedule B, including, without
limitation, in making any directors determination, the directors shall act
honestly and in good faith. Provided that the directors of Amalco so
act, they shall not be liable to Amalco and neither they nor Amalco shall be
liable to any holder or beneficial owner of voting securities or any other
person for, nor with respect to any matter arising from or related to, any
act or omission to act in relation to this Schedule B.  To the extent that,
in accordance with subsection 10.1, any other person exercises the powers of
the directors of Amalco under these provisions, this subsection 10.4 applies
_mutatis mutandis_.

  



  

10.5 Any directors determination required or contemplated by this Schedule B
shall be expressed and conclusively evidenced by a resolution duly adopted.

  



  

 **11.** Shareholders Declarations

  

 ** **

  

11.1 For purposes of monitoring the compliance with and of enforcing the
provisions of this Schedule B, the directors of Amalco may require that any
registered holder or beneficial owner, or any other person of whom it is, in
the circumstances, reasonable to make such request, file with Amalco or its
registrar and transfer agent a completed shareholders declaration. The
directors of Amalco shall determine from time to time written guidelines with
respect to the nature of the shareholders declaration to be requested, the
times at which shareholders declarations are to be requested and any other
relevant matters relating to shareholders declarations.

  



  

11.2 A shareholders declaration shall be in the form from time to time
determined by the directors of Amalco pursuant to subsection 11.1 and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may be required to be in
the form of a simple declaration in writing or a statutory declaration under
the _Canada Evidence Act_. Without limiting the generality of its contents,
any shareholders declaration may be required to contain information with
respect to:

  



  

(a) whether the person is the beneficial owner of or controls particular
voting securities or whether any other person is the beneficial owner of or
controls those voting securities; and

  



  

(b) whether the person is an associate of any other person, including whether
the person and any other person act, or are parties to an agreement or an
arrangement, a purpose of which is to require them to act, in concert with
respect to their interests, direct or indirect, in Amalco.

 **SCHEDULE 3.1**

  



  

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SUNCOR_**

  



  

(a) _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Suncor and its
Material Subsidiaries is a corporation or partnership, as applicable, duly
incorporated or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation, formation or continuance and has the
requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to own its properties
as now owned and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Suncor is, and its Material Subsidiaries are, duly registered to do business
and each is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties, owned or leased, or the nature of its activities makes such
registration necessary, except where the failure to be so registered or in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Suncor and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Copies of the Articles of Amalgamation of
Suncor dated January 1, 1989 together with all amendments to date and the by-
laws of Suncor have been provided to Petro-Canada and are accurate and
complete as of the date hereof and have not been amended or superseded.

  



  

(b) _Authority Relative this Agreement_. Suncor has the requisite
corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
participation by Suncor in the Arrangement contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by Suncors board of directors and, subject to such approval of
Suncor Shareholders as is stipulated by the Court in the Interim Order, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Suncor are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or the Arrangement. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Suncor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Suncor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws of general application
relating to or affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies,
including specific performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered.

  



  

(c) _Material Subsidiaries_. Suncor has no Material Subsidiaries other than

owned, the beneficial direct or indirect owner of all of the outstanding
shares and other ownership interests of Suncors Subsidiaries with good title
thereto free and clear of any and all Encumbrances. There are no outstanding
options, rights, entitlements, understandings or commitments (contingent or
otherwise) regarding the right to acquire any such shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests in any of Suncors Subsidiaries. All of the

agreement, lien, contract or other instrument or obligation to which Suncor
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of them, or any
of their respective

        
   

  



  

properties or assets, may be subject or by which Suncor or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound, except for such defaults which would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(ii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Suncor nor the
consummation of the Arrangement contemplated hereby nor compliance by Suncor
with any of the provisions hereof will: (A) violate, conflict with, or result
in a breach of any provision of, require any consent, approval or notice
under, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default) or result in a right of termination
or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any
of the properties or assets of Suncor or any of its Subsidiaries or cause any
indebtedness to come due before its stated maturity or cause any credit to
cease to be available, under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
(1) their respective charter or by-laws or (2) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, loan agreement, deed of trust, agreement, lien, contract or other
instrument or obligation to which Suncor or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or to which any of them, or any of their respective properties
or assets, may be subject or by which Suncor or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound; or (B) subject to compliance with the statutes and regulations
referred to below, violate any Laws, judgment, ruling, order, writ,

and (B) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or creations of Encumbrances which, or any
consents, approvals or notices which if not given or received, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Suncor or significantly impede the ability of
Suncor to consummate the Arrangement); or (C) cause the suspension or
revocation of any authorization, consent, approval or license currently in

Laws that regulate competition, antitrust, foreign investment or
transportation), the terms of the Interim Order and the Final Order in
respect of the Arrangement and the filing of the Articles of Arrangement, (A)
there is no legal impediment to Suncors consummation of the Arrangement, and
(B) no filing or registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of,
any domestic or foreign public body or authority is required of Suncor in
connection with the consummation of the Arrangement, except for such filings
or registrations which, if not made, or for such authorizations, consents or
approvals which, if not received, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Suncor or significantly impede the ability of Suncor to consummate the
Arrangement.

  



  

(f) _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations
by Governmental Entities pending or, to the knowledge of Suncor,
threatened, affecting or that would reasonably be expected to affect Suncor
or any of its Subsidiaries or affecting or that would reasonably be expected
to affect any of their property or assets at Law or equity or before or by
any court or Governmental Entity which action, suit, proceeding or
investigation involves a possibility of any judgment against or liability of
Suncor or any of its Subsidiaries which, if successful, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Suncor or would significantly impede the ability of Suncor
to consummate the Arrangement. Neither Suncor nor its Subsidiaries is subject

circumstances in which they were made, not misleading and complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws. Since December 31, 2008, Suncor
has not filed any material change reports which continue to be confidential.
The Suncor Financial Statements and all financial statements of Suncor and
its Subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in such forms,
statements, prospectuses and other offering documents were prepared in
accordance with Canadian GAAP (except (i) as otherwise indicated in such
financial statements and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited
statements, in the related report of Suncors independent auditors or (ii) in
the case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they are subject to
normal year-end adjustments), and fairly present the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and changes in financial position of Suncor
and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for the periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments) and reflect appropriate and adequate
reserves in respect of contingent liabilities, if any, of Suncor and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. There has been no change in
Suncor accounting policies, except as described in the notes to the Suncor
Financial Statements, since December 31, 2008.

  



  

(r) _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Suncor has no material obligations
or liabilities of any nature (matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent),
other than:

  



  

(i) those set forth or adequately provided for in the balance sheet included
in Suncors audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008
(the " **Suncor Balance Sheet** ");

  



  

(ii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required to be
set forth in the Suncor Balance Sheet under Canadian GAAP;

  



  

(iii) those incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Suncor
Balance Sheet Date and consistent with past practice; and

  



        
   

  



  

(iv) those incurred in connection with the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

(s) _No Material Adverse Change_. Since December 31, 2008: (i) Suncor has
conducted its business only in the ordinary and normal course, (ii)
no liability or obligation of any nature (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) material to Suncor has been incurred other than in
the ordinary course of business, and (iii) there has not been any Material
Adverse Change in respect of Suncor.

  



  

(t) _Conduct of Business_. Since December 31, 2008 neither Suncor nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would be in violation of Section
5.1 if such provision had been in effect since that date, other than
violations which would not have any Material Adverse Effect on Suncor or
would not significantly impede Suncors ability to consummate the
Arrangement contemplated hereby.

  



  

(u) _United States Relationships_. Suncor is a "foreign private issuer"
as defined in Rule 405 under the U.S. Securities Act.

  



  

(v) _Environmental_.

  



  

(i) There have not occurred any material spills, emissions or pollution on
any property of Suncor or as a result of its operations, nor has Suncor been
subject to any stop orders, control orders, clean-up orders or reclamation
orders under applicable Environmental Laws, any of which would individually
or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on Suncor. All operations
of Suncor and its Subsidiaries have been and are now being conducted in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, except where the failure
to be in compliance would not individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect on Suncor. Neither Suncor nor any or its Material
Subsidiaries is aware of, or is subject to:

  



  

(1) any proceeding, application, order or directive which relates to
environmental, health or safety matters, and which may require any material
work, repairs, construction, or expenditures; or

  



  

(2) any demand or notice with respect to the breach of any Environmental Laws
applicable to Suncor or any of its Subsidiaries, including any regulations
respecting the use, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposition of any
Hazardous Substances,

  



  

which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Suncor.

  



  

(ii) In the ordinary course of its business, Suncor periodically reviews the
effect of Environmental Laws on various business, operations and properties
of Suncor and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and
evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation,
any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of
properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or
approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential
liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review, Suncor has
reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not
result in a Material Adverse Change.

  



  

(w) _Title_. Suncor and its Material Subsidiaries have good and sufficient
title to their real property interests including fee simple estate of and in
real property, leases, easements, rights of way, permits or licenses from
landowners or authorities permitting the use of land by Suncor and its
Material Subsidiaries

  



        
   

  



  

necessary to permit the operation of its business as presently owned and
conducted. Suncor does not have any knowledge nor is aware of any defects,
failures or impairments in the title of Suncor to its assets, whether or not
an action, suit, proceeding or inquiry is pending or threatened or whether or
not discovered by any third party, which in aggregate would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Suncor.

(i) Suncor has not received notice of any default under any of the leases and
other title and operating documents or any other agreement or instrument
pertaining to Suncors oil and gas assets to which Suncor is a party or by or

that such defaults would not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect
on Suncor.

  



  

(ii) To its knowledge:

  



  

(1) Suncor is in good standing under all, and is not in default under any;
and

  



  

(2) there is no existing condition, circumstance or matter which constitutes

a default under any,

  



  

leases and other title and operating documents or any other agreements and
instruments pertaining to its oil and gas assets to which it is a party or by
or to which it or such assets are bound or subject and, to their knowledge,
all such leases, title and operating documents and other agreements and
instruments are in good standing and in full force and effect and none of the
counterparties to such leases, title and operating documents and other
agreements and instruments is in default thereunder except to the extent that
such defaults would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Suncor.

compliance with all licenses, permits, certificates, consents, orders, grants
and other authorizations of or from any Governmental Entity necessary to

the aggregate, not have a Material Adverse Effect on Suncor.

closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit,
