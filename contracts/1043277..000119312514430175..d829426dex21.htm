immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided
by applicable Law; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the name of the
corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

 

2.7 _Directors and Officers_. The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the directors and officers of Merger Sub,
in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



16 2.8 _Effect of the Merger on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger
Sub, the Company or any Stockholder:

(a) _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Shares that are owned by
the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or any of its direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be
cancelled and retired in accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_, and (ii)
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Closing
Per Share Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest, together with any
amounts that may become payable in respect of such Share in the future from
the Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or in
respect of the Post-Closing Adjustment, at the respective times and subject
to the contingencies specified herein and therein.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.9 _Treatment of Options and Corporate Actions_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Optionholder or any other Person,
cancelled and each Optionholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, and (ii) each Vested Optionholder, as shown on _Exhibit 2.9_
, shall be entitled to receive with respect to such Vested Option the sum of
(A) the amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
aggregate number of Shares subject to such Vested Option, multiplied by (y)
the excess, if any, of the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Vested Option as set forth on _Exhibit 2.9_ , and
(B) any amounts that may become payable in respect of such Vested Option in
the future from the Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement or in respect of the Post-Closing Adjustment, in each case, at the
respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the sum of clauses (A) and
(B) is less than or equal to zero in respect of an Optionholders Vested
Options, then such Optionholder shall receive no consideration for such
Vested Options. As a condition to the receipt of the foregoing consideration
provided in this _Section 2.9(a)_, each Vested Optionholder shall agree and
acknowledge in an option surrender agreement substantially in the form of
_Exhibit 2.9_ hereto (each, an "Option Surrender Agreement"), that such
Optionholder (A) approves of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and
all the arrangements relating thereto, (B) approves the appointment of the
Stockholders Representative in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
(C) represents and warrants that it is the owner of all Vested Options shown
on _Exhibit 2.9_ as held by such Vested Optionholder free and clear of all
Liens and (D) acknowledges that such Vested Optionholders portion of the
Merger Consideration, payable in accordance with the terms of this _Section
2.9(a)_, constitutes all of the consideration that such Vested Optionholder
is entitled to receive with respect to the Vested Options held by such Vested
Optionholder. After the Effective Time, each Vested Optionholder shall only be
entitled to the payments described in this  _Section 2.9(a)_.

 



17 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Section 2.9(a)_ and to (x) terminate, effective as of the Effective Time,
the Stock Option Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement (or
provision thereof) for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the
Shares and (y) ensure that neither Buyer, the Company nor any of their
Subsidiaries will, as of the Effective Time, be bound by any rights under the
Stock Option Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement (or provision
thereof) for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the Shares or
other rights in respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except the obligation to make, and
the right of a Vested Optionholder to receive, the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.9(a)_ in cancellation and settlement of Vested Options.

 

2.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, including _Section 2.8_, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_) and held by a holder who has not voted in
favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred to collectively as the
"Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect
or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect
to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive a portion of
the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that if,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if
a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_, without interest
thereon. The Company shall provide Buyer prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand,
and Buyer shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 

2.11 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all Shares and all Options outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 2.10_, each holder of a
certificate formerly representing any Shares (each, a "Certificate") and each
holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the
Company or a holder of Options.

 



18 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint the Escrow Agent to act
as the exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent").

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in any event
not later than ten Business Days thereafter, unless previously delivered by
the Company, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of Company Common
Stock a letter of transmittal in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit
B_ (a "Letter of Transmittal") and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates in exchange for the applicable portion of Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_. The Exchange Agent shall, no
later than the later of (i) the Closing Date (or if the Closing Date is not a
Business Day, the first Business Day after the Closing Date) or (ii) two
Business Days after receipt of a Certificate, together with a Letter of
Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and any other customary documents that the Exchange
Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith, pay to the holder of
such Certificate a cash amount as provided in  _Section 2.8(b)_ with respect
to such Certificate so surrendered and the Certificate shall forthwith be
cancelled. Unless otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to
receive the portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.8(b)_. If after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the
Exchange Agent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Section 2.11_. 

(d) With respect to a Vested Optionholder, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to such Vested Optionholder on the Closing Date (or if the
Closing Date is not a Business Day, the first Business Day after the Closing
Date), the cash amount as provided in _Section 2.9(a)_ and the Consideration
Spreadsheet, less any required Tax withholding. For payments made, if any, to
a Vested Optionholder pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement on a date
after the Closing Date, the Stockholders Representative and Buyer will
cooperate to promptly make such payments in a manner (including through the
Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate, if applicable) that
ensures proper Tax withholding and information reporting, as required by
applicable Law and, subject to the foregoing, to ensure that payments are paid
on the same schedule and under the same terms and conditions as apply to
payments to Stockholders generally.

(e) Each Stockholder and each Vested Optionholder set forth in  _Exhibit
2.9_ shall also be entitled to any amounts that may be payable in the future
in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Stockholders
Certificate and such Vested Optionholders cancelled Vested Options from the
Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and on
account of the Post-Closing Adjustment, at the respective time and subject to
the contingencies specified herein and therein. Unless otherwise provided
herein, no interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of Stockholders
or Vested Optionholders on the Merger Consideration.

(f) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



19 (g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the
Stockholders six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Buyer,
upon demand, and any such Stockholder who has not exchanged Certificates for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.11_ prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of the Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , that any such portion of the Merger Consideration
payable from the Escrow Funds shall be held and distributed to the Persons
entitled thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, at the respective times and subject to the contingencies
specified herein and therein and any portion of the Post-Closing Adjustment to
which the Stockholders may become entitled shall become payable at the
times and subject to the contingencies specified herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall not be liable to any holder of Certificates for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Stockholders one
year after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Buyer, upon
demand.

2.12 _Escrow Funds_. In accordance with the Escrow Agreement, Buyer shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent:

(a) the Indemnification Escrow Amount (such amount, including any interest or
other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the "Indemnification Escrow Fund"), to
be held for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the
Stockholders and Vested Optionholders set forth in this Agreement;

(b) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (such amount, including any
interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the "Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund"), to be held for the purpose of securing the obligations of the
Stockholders and Vested Optionholders in  _Section 2.17(e)_; and

(c) the Special Indemnification Escrow Amount (such amount, including any
interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the "Special Indemnification Escrow
Fund" and together with the Indemnification Escrow Fund and the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund, the "Escrow Funds"), to be held for the purpose of
securing the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders and Vested
Optionholders set forth in _Exhibit 9.2(a)(vii)_.

 



20 2.13 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock And Options_. All
Merger Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender of Certificates, and
the cancellation of Options, in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid or payable in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and such
Options, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_ and elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

2.14 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur, including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or
any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

 

2.15 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article 2_
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

2.16  _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Buyer may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this _Article 2_.

 

2.17 _Calculation of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Pre-Closing Statement. At least three Business Days before the Closing,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Pre-Closing
Statement") setting forth its good faith estimate of (i) Closing Working
Capital (the "Estimated Closing Date Working Capital"), (ii) a calculation of
the resulting Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, (iii) the Estimated
Closing Date Cash, (iv) the Closing Tax Asset (the "Estimated Closing Tax
Asset"), (v) the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses, (vi) the Pay-Off
Amount, (vii) the Closing Tax Liability (the "Estimated Closing Tax
Liability") and (viii) the resulting calculation of Closing Merger
Consideration and Closing Per Share Merger Consideration. Buyer shall be
entitled to review, comment on and request reasonable changes to the Pre-
Closing Statement, and the Company shall consult and confer with Buyer and
consider in good faith any comments made by Buyer with respect to the Pre-
Closing Statement.

 



21 (b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
the Stockholders Representative a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement")
setting forth (1) its calculation of Closing Working Capital, (2) a
calculation of the resulting Final Working Capital Adjustment, (3) Company
Transaction Expenses, (4) Closing Date Cash, (5) Closing Tax Liability and
(6) the resulting Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(ii) The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to (A) the Final
Working Capital Adjustment,  _plus_ (B) the difference between Estimated
Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Cash (which can be a positive or negative
number), _plus_ (C) the difference between Estimated Closing Tax Asset and
Closing Tax Asset (which can be a positive or negative number), _plus_ (D)
the difference between Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses and Company
Transaction Expenses (which can be a positive or negative number), _plus_ (E)
the difference between Estimated Closing Tax Liability and Closing Tax
Liability (which can be a positive or negative number).

(c) The final Post-Closing Adjustment shall be determined as follows:

(i) The Post-Closing Adjustment shall be the amount set forth in the Post-
Closing Statement if (A) the Stockholders Representative gives notice to
Buyer of its acceptance of the Post-Closing Statement, or (B) the
Stockholders Representative does not give notice to Buyer of its disagreement
with Post-Closing Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement") on or before the
45th day following delivery of the Post-Closing Statement to the Stockholders
Representative. A Notice of Disagreement shall (1) specify in reasonable
detail the nature of any disagreement and (2) only include disagreements
based on mathematical errors or based on the Post-Closing Statement not being
calculated in accordance with _this Agreement_. During its review following
the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, the Stockholders Representative
(or its agents) shall have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or
workpapers, including those of independent auditors or other agents, used in
the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, to the personnel who prepared
the Post-Closing Statement and to other employees of or accountants or
advisors to Buyer to the extent access is reasonably required for the
Stockholders Representative to assess the acceptability of the Post-Closing
Statement.

(ii) If the Stockholders Representative delivers a Notice of Disagreement to
Buyer on or before the 45th day following the delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement to the Stockholders Representative, then the Post-Closing
Adjustment shall be the amount (A) agreed upon by Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative in writing, or (B) if Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative are unable to reach agreement, then as determined by the
Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 2.17(d)_.

 

(d) During the 20-day period following the delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement, Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If all such
differences are not so resolved within such 20-day period and either party
continues to dispute any such difference, then any remaining differences may
be submitted by either party to the dispute resolution group of KPMG LLP (the
"Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall be instructed by the parties to
resolve all matters which

 



22  remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and
to determine the Post-Closing Adjustment consistent with the provisions of
this Agreement. The Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall not, make
any other determination, including (i) any determination with respect to any
matter included in the Post-Closing Statement or the Notice of Disagreement
that was not submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm, (ii) any
determination as to whether GAAP was followed for the Financial Statements,
(iii) any determination as to the accuracy of _Section 3.5_ or any other
representation or warranty in this Agreement or (iv) any determination as to
compliance by the Company or Buyer with any of its covenants under this
Agreement. The Accounting Firms determination will be limited to: (A) whether
the Post-Closing Statement was determined in accordance with the definitions
and provisions of this Agreement; and (B) whether there were any mathematical
errors in the calculations. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be
made as an expert and not as an arbiter, and the determination shall not
be by independent review. Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall be
entitled to provide written submissions regarding their positions on the
disputed matters, which written submissions shall be provided to the
Accounting Firm, if at all, no later than five Business Days after the date
of referral of the disputed matters to the Accounting Firm. The determination
of the Accounting Firm shall be made based on the written submissions by Buyer
and the Stockholders Representative and their respective representatives and
any telephone or in-person meetings or presentations. All parties and their
respective representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in
such meetings or presentations. The Accounting Firm shall have the discretion
to arrange for submission of written responses to further inquiries, or such
other information gathering as the Accounting Firm deems necessary to render
an informed decision. In preparing its report, the Accounting Firm shall not
assign a value to any disputed amount other than one submitted by Buyer or the
Stockholders Representative. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use
its best efforts to notify the parties of its determinations in writing
within 30 days following its appointment. The Accounting Firms determinations
shall be conclusive, final, and binding on all parties to this Agreement. The
Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall pay their own respective costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the matters described in this
_Section 2.17(d)_, provided that the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be borne entirely by the party whose assertions regarding the Post-
Closing Adjustment differ by the greatest amount from the Post-Closing
Adjustment determined by such Accounting Firm.

 

(e) Within three Business Days after the final determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment pursuant to this _Section 2.17_:

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, the
Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (A) to Buyer, the Post-Closing
Adjustment, and (B) to the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the
Stockholders and Vested Optionholders, such Stockholders and Vested
Optionholders aggregate Pro Rata Share of any amounts remaining in the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is
greater than the amount held in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund,
then the Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Indemnification Escrow Fund by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to Buyer the amount by which the
Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the amount in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund (up to the amount in the Indemnification Escrow Fund).

 



23 (ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, (A) Buyer
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Stockholders
and Vested Optionholders, such Stockholders and Vested Optionholders
aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Post-Closing Adjustment and (B) the
Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent, for
distribution to the Stockholders and Vested Optionholders such Stockholders
and Vested Optionholders aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund.

 

(iii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is zero, then no payments will be made in
respect thereto, and the Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange
Agent, for distribution to the Stockholders and Vested Optionholders such
Stockholders and Vested Optionholders aggregate Pro Rata Share of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.

(f) Any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.17_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 

2.18 _Consideration Spreadsheet_.

 

(a) At least three Business Days before the Closing and concurrently with the
delivery of the Pre-Closing Statement, the Company shall prepare and deliver
to Buyer a spreadsheet (the "Consideration Spreadsheet") that shall set forth,
as of the Closing Date and immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
following:

 

(i) the names and addresses of all Stockholders and the number of Shares held
by such Persons and their portion of the Closing Merger Consideration;

(ii) the name and address of each Vested Optionholder, his or her portion of
the Closing Merger Consideration and any related tax withholding; and

(iii) each Stockholders and Vested Optionholders share of the amount to be
contributed to the Escrow Funds.

(b) The parties agree that Buyer and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on
the Consideration Spreadsheet in making payments under _Article 2_ and Buyer
and Merger Sub shall not be responsible for the calculations or the
determinations regarding such calculations in such Consideration Spreadsheet.

statement set forth in _Sections 3.1_ through _3.23_ is qualified

 



24  by the matters set forth in the _Disclosure Schedule_ , which has been
organized by sections to correspond with the sections set forth in this
_Article 3_. Any fact or circumstance disclosed with respect to a particular

on its Business as now conducted by it. The Company is qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction in which its ownership or leasing of property or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for
such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1(a)(i)_ of the _Disclosure
Schedule_ contains a complete and accurate list of the jurisdictions in which
the Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation. The Company
has delivered true and complete copies of its organizational documents to

operate its properties and assets and to carry on its Business as
now conducted by it. Each Company Subsidiary is qualified to do business and
is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which its

Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Company-Owned IP") or pursuant to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary granted any rights under any

39 (c) The Company and Company Subsidiaries have taken steps to protect and
maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the Company and Company

Company through written agreement with the Company. Except as set forth in 
_Section 3.16(c)_ of the _Disclosure Schedule_ , no current or former
director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor of Company has any
right, license, claim or interest in any Company-Owned IP. To the Knowledge of

that is subject to any agreement under which such employee has assigned or
otherwise granted to any third party any rights in or to such Intellectual

Company Subsidiary to any liability to any third party for improperly
soliciting such employee or consultant, or independent contractor to work for
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, whether such liability is based on
contractual or other legal obligations to such third party.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.16(d)_ of the _Disclosure Schedule_ ,
neither the execution, delivery nor performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will, with respect to any
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound as of the
date hereof: (i) constitute a material breach or default under any contract
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party that governs the
licensing or use of Intellectual Property; (ii) cause the termination or loss
of, or give rise to a right of termination of or to cause the loss of, any
rights in any Company IP by the Surviving Corporation that is subject to any
such Intellectual Property Agreement; or (iii) impair the right of the

disposition of any Intellectual Property by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for the conduct of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
business as currently conducted, or for Intellectual Property incorporated in
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries products, and none will become
payable solely as a result of the consummation of this Agreement.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no unauthorized use,
unauthorized disclosure, infringement, violation or misappropriation by any
third party of any Company-Owned IP. Except as set forth in _Section 3.16(e)_
of the _Disclosure Schedule_ , the Company has not received any notice that
any third party is infringing, violating or misappropriating any part of the
Company-Owned IP or otherwise making any unauthorized use or disclosure of
such Company-Owned IP.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.16(f)_ of the _Disclosure Schedule_ ,
the Company has not received any notice or claim regarding any offer to
license a third partys Intellectual Property alleged in such notice or claim
to be used by the Company or Company Subsidiary without authorization,
infringed, violated or misappropriated by the Company or Company Subsidiary,
or otherwise alleging any infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any
Intellectual Property owned by a third party. The conduct of business by the
Company and Company Subsidiaries as previously and currently conducted does
not infringe, violate or misappropriate any Intellectual Property owned by any
third party.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has used, copied,
incorporated or otherwise exploited any Open Source Software in such a
way that requires the Company or Company Subsidiary to disclose any Company-
Owned IP (other than such Open Source Software and modifications thereto) or
that has caused the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant to any third
party on or before the Closing any rights or immunities under any Company-
Owned IP (other than with respect to such Open Source Software and
modifications thereto).

 

(h) A privacy statement addressing the collection, retention, use and
distribution of the personally identifiable information of
individuals visiting the websites of the Company and Company Subsidiaries

with the Privacy Statements applicable to any given set of personally
identifiable information collected by the Company and any Company Subsidiary;

information. The Company and Company Subsidiaries have taken measures to
protect and maintain the confidential nature of the personally identifiable
information provided to the Company and any Company Subsidiary by individuals
and to personal information collected from individuals against loss, theft
and unauthorized access or disclosure, which measures are, as a whole, not
less protective and comprehensive than those that would be taken by reasonably
prudent business persons operating a business similar to the Business. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any claims, notices or
complaints from any Governmental Entity regarding the Companys or Company
Subsidiaries information practices or the disclosure, retention, or misuse of
any personally identifiable information.

 



41 (i) The Companys and Company Subsidiaries development, use, sale or
exploitation of software developed by the Company and Company Subsidiaries
does not violate any right of any other Person and the Company has not
received any communication alleging such a violation. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has any ongoing obligations to compensate any other
Person for the development, use, sale or exploitation of any software
developed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as otherwise set
forth in _Section 3.16(i)_ of the _Disclosure Schedule_ , neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has granted to any other Person any
exclusive license, option or other rights to develop, use, sell or exploit in
any manner such software, whether requiring the payment of royalties or not,
except for licenses granted in the ordinary course of business.

(j) The Company and Company Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to
keep secret and have not disclosed the source code for the software or any
other confidential material or trade secret pertaining to the software to any
third party other than in the course of having such third party perform
services for the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No source code (or any
aspect or portion thereof) has been provided to any escrow agent or other
third party.

 

(k) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys software used to operate
the Companys and the Companys Subsidiaries website does not contain, and

computer worm, computer time bomb, or similar component) that would damage,
destroy, or alter the Companys owned software or databases (including any
content therein).

(l) No litigation is pending or has been threatened against the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries which challenges the legality, validity,
enforceability or ownership of any license, sublicense or other contract
covering or relating to any software used by the Company.

(m) The IT Assets are sufficient to conduct the Business as currently
conducted. Except as set forth on  _Section 3.16(m)_ of the _Disclosure
Schedule_ , the IT Assets have not materially malfunctioned or failed and the
Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to secure and protect the IT
assets. To the Knowledge of the Company, no person has gained unauthorized

and expeditiously prosecute and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain

51  such filing or any proposed oral or written communication with any
Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other party with copies
of all filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence

to require, the Buyer (i) to agree to any limitation on its rights under this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents (ii) to litigate any actual suit
sought by any Governmental Entity or any other Person or (iii) to propose,
negotiate, offer to commit or to effect (A) any sale, divestiture, license,
hold separate or other disposition of assets or business of the Buyer or the

restrictions on the control or conduct of any business of Buyer or the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case that
would materially deprive Buyer of the benefit of the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement or Buyers and its Affiliates current operations. Buyer

take any action with respect to satisfying any Antitrust Laws that would bind
the Company in the event the Closing does not occur.

as Buyer or its authorized representatives from time to time reasonably may
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) such access does not disrupt the

by law or to such portions of documents or information subject to attorney-
client privilege and the provision of which, as determined by counsel of the
Company, may eliminate the privilege pertaining to such documents.

Representative or Buyer shall at any time prior to or after the Closing,
without the prior written consent of the others, make or permit to be made by

receipt of the Written Consent, the Company shall prepare and mail a notice
(the "Stockholder Notice") to every Stockholder that did not execute the

(c) The Company shall (a) no later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, solicit from each "disqualified individual" with respect to the
Company (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) who has received
or will receive any payment or benefits that would constitute a "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver
of such disqualified individuals rights to some or all of such payments or
benefits (the "Waived 280G Benefits") so that all remaining payments and/or
benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (b) no later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each individual who
agrees to the waiver described in clause (a), submit to a stockholder vote

right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive or retain the Waived
280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such waivers and approval materials, the
Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials to Buyer

of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) as contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits
shall not be made, provided or retained, as the case may be. Prior to the

for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered,
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith and
use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and
the Stockholders Representative are unable to reach such agreement within 5
days after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the disputed items shall be
resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by Buyer and
reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Representative (the "Accounting
Referee") and any determination by the Accounting Referee shall be final. The
Accounting Referee shall resolve any disputed items within ten days of having
the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the
Accounting Referee is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer and
then amended to reflect the Accounting Referees resolution. The costs, fees,
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand. The
preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
exclusively within the control of Buyer.

 



56 (b) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or permit
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise
modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxable Period (or
with respect to any Straddle Period) without the written consent of the
Stockholders Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably delayed,
withheld or conditioned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Tax
Return is filed while a tax claim relating to Pre-Closing Taxes for which the
Stockholders might have an indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section
9.2_ is pending, and such Tax Return must be amended as a result of and based
upon the resolution of such Tax Claim, Buyer agrees to amend such Tax Return
solely to reflect the resolution of such Contest and the Stockholders
Representative shall not withhold its consent to such amendment.

 

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any income and sales or
use Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based
on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable year of any pass-through entity will
be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of any other Tax with
respect to the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries with respect to any
Straddle Period which relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in such Straddle Period

 

(d) After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify the Stockholders
Representative in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement
of an audit received by such party from any Governmental Authority or any
other Person with respect to Taxes for which the Stockholders are liable
pursuant to _Section 9.2_ of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
a failure to give such notice will not affect Buyers rights to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ except to the extent that the
Stockholders are actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax
liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or
other document received from any Governmental Authority or any other Person in
respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

 

(e) The Stockholders Representative shall control the conduct, through
counsel of his own choosing at his own expense, of any Action, audit, claim
for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted
Tax liability or refund with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (any such Action or audit or proceeding relating to an asserted
Tax liability in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ referred to herein as a "Tax Claim")
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; provided, however, that the
Stockholders Representative will not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



57 (f) In the case of a Tax Claim that relates to Straddle Periods, Buyer shall
control the conduct of such Tax Claim, but the Stockholders Representative
shall have the right to participate in such Tax Claim at his own expense and,
with the written consent of Buyer, in Buyers sole discretion, and at his
expense, may assume control of the conduct of such Tax Claim. Neither Buyer,
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall settle, compromise
and/or concede such Tax Claim without the consent of the Stockholders
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. If Buyer fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Tax
Claim within a reasonable period following the receipt by Buyer of notice of
such Tax Claim, the Stockholders Representative shall have the right to
assume control of such Tax Claim and shall be able to settle, compromise
and/or concede such Tax Claim in his sole discretion.

 

(g) The Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall provide each other with
such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of
the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ or in
connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities.
Each of the Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records, and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which
such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions
except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such
extensions for the respective Tax periods. Any information obtained under
this _Section 5.12_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a
Tax Claim or other Tax proceeding.

(h) The Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Vested Optionholders, will be entitled to any credits and refunds (including
interest received thereon) in respect of any Pre-Closing Taxable Period except
with respect to the carryback of any Tax benefits from Post-Closing Tax
Periods. Buyer shall cause such refund or the amount of such credit to be
paid to the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders and
the Vested Optionholders, promptly after it is received, allowed or applied
against any Tax liability.

 

(i) The parties agree that the Company will recognize an income tax deduction
as a result of the recognition of compensation income by its employees
related to payments with respect to Options and other employee payments
related to the Closing. In addition, the parties agree that the Company will
be required to pay its payroll taxes (in addition to the payroll taxes that
such employees may be required to pay for which the Company must withhold) as
a result of such income recognition. The parties further agree that the
economic benefit of such compensation payments through related tax deductions
shall inure to Stockholders and that the cost of the Companys payroll taxes
shall be borne by the Stockholders. The parties contemplate that the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall end at the end of the day which includes the
Effective Time. In order to allow the Company to report the income, gain,
loss and deductions attributable to such day (including the compensation
deduction discussed above and the Companys payroll tax expense), the Company
shall elect to change its tax year for 2014 to a 52-53 week tax year with
respect to the Thursday nearest December 31 ( _i.e._ , January 1, 2015.) Buyer
shall cause the Company to timely file Form 1128 in order for the Company to
change its year end for 2014 to the Thursday nearest December 31\. If the
Companys change of accounting period described in this _Section 5.12(i)_ is
not effective, Buyer

 



58  and Company shall cooperate in having the Company file a one day return for
January 1, 2015 (or other short period), and carryback the loss so that the
benefit of the net operating loss created by the compensation deduction is
realized by the Stockholders, although in no case shall the Stockholders
realize a double benefit for the tax savings created by the compensation
deduction.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

7.1 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
or cause to be provided to the officers and employees of the Company who at
the Closing Date remain employed by the Company ("Continuing Employees"), base
and incentive compensation and employee benefits under employee benefit plans
on terms and conditions which when taken as a whole are substantially similar
to those provided to similarly-situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 



60 (b) For purposes of participation, vesting and determination of rates of
contribution or benefits under Buyers employee benefit plans (but not
accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension Plan, eligibility under
any retiree medical program or vesting under any equity compensation program),
(i) qualifying service under any qualified retirement Plan of the Company
shall be treated as qualified service under Buyers qualified retirement plans
following the Closing and (ii) qualifying service under any other employee
benefit plans of the Company shall be treated as qualified service under any
similar employee benefit plans maintained by Buyer following Closing,
including vacation pay plans and severance plans; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

(c) Buyer shall cause the group medical plans of Buyer that cover the
Continuing Employees after the Closing Date to the extent permitted under such
group medical plans: (i) waive any waiting period and restrictions and
limitations for preexisting conditions or insurability, (ii) cause any
payments made by the Continuing Employees under Companys medical benefit plan
to be credited to such Continuing Employees under Buyers medical benefit
plans, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements that the Continuing Employees must meet under Buyers medical
plans for the plan year that contains the Closing Date, and (iii) carry
over the current years elections, contributions, and reimbursements under
any cafeteria plan of Company. In addition, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the insurer of any other welfare plans that cover
the Continuing Employees after the Closing Date to waive any waiting periods,
restrictions and limitations for pre-existing conditions or insurability. The
continued coverage of the Continuing Employees under the employee benefit
plans maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date during
a transition period shall be deemed to provide the Continuing Employees with
benefits that are no less favorable than those offered to other employees of
Buyer and its subsidiaries. Buyer shall also cause the Company to honor all
provisions for vested benefits or other vested amount earned or accrued
through the Closing Date under the Companys employee benefit Plans.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of 18 months following the
Closing, Buyer agrees to provide to each Continuing Employee of the Company
who is not a Key Employee or a Select Key Employee, severance benefits that
are no less favorable than those agreed to in such Continuing Employees
employment agreement listed in _Section 3.9_ of the _Disclosure Schedule_ ,
and that such severance benefits shall be determined without taking into
account any reduction in compensation paid to the individual after the
Effective Time.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement will obligate Buyer or the Company to continue
the employment of any individual for any specific period after Closing
(including any employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of
absence).

7.2 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_. The Company shall, and Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify each former or current
director and officer of the Company, to the fullest extent to which such
director or officer was, is, or would be entitled to indemnification
(including advances and reimbursement for expenses) under the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any individual agreements with any
such directors, officers, employees or agents, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that, for avoidance of doubt the
directors and officers shall not be entitled to indemnification for any
amounts which they are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Group pursuant to the
terms of  _Article 9_. Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain directors and officers insurance covering such directors and officers
in such capacity in an amount not less than the

 



61  amount of coverage maintained by the Company at the Closing, and with other
terms, conditions and deductibles not less advantageous than such coverage,
for a period of six years after the Closing. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Closing, which policies
provide such directors and officers with coverage that is
substantially equivalent to, and no less favorable in the aggregate than, the
Companys existing policies, for an aggregate period of six years with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing,
including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.3 _Waiver of Conflicts; Jointly Privileged Information_.

 

(a) Recognizing that Husch Blackwell LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP have
acted as legal counsel to the Company prior to the Closing, and that Husch
Blackwell LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP intend to act as legal counsel
to the Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders and their Affiliates
(which will no longer include the Company) after the Closing, each of Buyer
and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Husch
Blackwell LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP representing the Stockholders
Representative, the Stockholders and/or their Affiliates after the Closing as
such representation may relate to Buyer, the Company or the transactions
contemplated herein or related hereto. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between the
Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders, their Affiliates or the
Company, on the one-hand, and Husch Blackwell LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore
LLP, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Stockholders
Representative, the Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Company).
Accordingly, the Company shall not have access to any such communications, or
to the files of Husch Blackwell LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP relating
to such engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the
Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not
the Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and the Company shall not be a holder thereof,
(ii) to the extent that files of Husch Blackwell LLP and Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client,
only the Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Company) shall hold
such property rights and (iii) neither Husch Blackwell LLP or Cravath, Swaine
and Moore LLP shall have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Company by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Husch Blackwell LLP or Cravath, Swaine and
Moore LLP and the Company or otherwise.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, the Stockholders Representative shall be permitted to remove from
the Company any email, document and other records containing attorney-client
privileged information relating to the transactions contemplated hereby where
the attorney-client privilege is held jointly between the Company on the one
hand, and either the Stockholders Representative or any of its Affiliates on
the other hand ("Jointly Privileged Information"). From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide to the Stockholders
Representative all copies (including electronic, digital, or otherwise) of any
Jointly Privileged Information that is inadvertently not removed prior to the
Closing. The Stockholders Representative agrees that any email,

 



62  document and other record temporarily removed for analysis to determine the
presence of Jointly Privileged Information pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section 7.3(b)_ shall be returned to the Company promptly following
completion of such review if it is determined by the Stockholders
Representative that such email, document or other record does not contain
Jointly Privileged Information.

 

7.4 _Appointment of the Stockholders  Representative_.

 

(a) As a term of the Merger, the Stockholders Representative is hereby
appointed as to act as the sole and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and
representative of each of the Stockholders by the consent of the Stockholders
and as such the Stockholders Representative is hereby authorized
and directed to (i) take any and all actions (including executing and
delivering any documents, incurring any costs and expenses for the account of
the Stockholders and making any and all determinations required by this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement) which may be required in carrying out its
duties under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii) exercise such other
rights, power and authority as are authorized, delegated and granted to the
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iii)
exercise such rights, power and authority as are incidental to the foregoing.
Any such actions taken, exercises of rights, power or authority, and any
decision or determination made by the Stockholders Representative consistent
therewith shall be absolutely and irrevocably binding on each Stockholder as
if such Stockholder personally had taken such action, exercised such rights,
power or authority or made such decision or determination in such
Stockholders individual capacity. The Stockholders shall severally and not
jointly indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold him
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence
or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Representative and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder.

 

(b) The Stockholders Representative may resign at any time, and the
Stockholders Representative may be removed by the vote of Persons which
collectively owned more than 50 percent of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Majority Holders"). The expenses of the
Stockholders Representative shall be paid from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, upon
written instruction to the Escrow Agent from the Stockholders Representative,
but only upon the release of any portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
that is to be paid to the Stockholders and Vested Optionholders. In the event
that a Stockholders Representative has resigned or been removed, a new
Stockholders Representative shall be appointed by a vote of the Majority
Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance
thereof by the new Stockholders Representative. Any successor Stockholders
Representative must agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement
applicable to the Stockholders Representative and will thereupon become the
Stockholders Representative for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(c) The Stockholders Representative shall have no duties towards the
Stockholders, and shall not incur any liability to the Stockholders, and the
Stockholders shall have no claims, including those that may arise in the
future, against the Stockholders Representative for any action or inaction
taken or not taken by him in connection with his service as the
Stockholders Representative, except to the extent that such action or
inaction shall have been held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
constitute fraud or willful misconduct.

 



63 (d) As a term of this Agreement, each Stockholder agrees, in addition to the
foregoing, that: Buyer and any member of the Buyer Group shall be entitled to
rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Stockholders
Representative as to (i) the settlement of any claims for indemnification by
Buyer or such other member of the Buyer Group pursuant to _Article 9_
hereof, or (ii) any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Stockholders Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, and no
party hereunder shall have any cause of action against Buyer or such member
of the Buyer Group for any action taken by Buyer or such member of the Buyer
Group in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Stockholders
Representative.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees
and successors of each Stockholder, and any references in this Agreement to a
Stockholder or the Stockholders shall mean and include the successors to the
rights of the Stockholders hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

7.5 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Stockholders prior to the Closing, or for any
other reasonable purpose, Buyer shall:

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of the Company
relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent
with the document retention policies of Buyer; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Stockholders Representative
reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Stockholders expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

 

(b) Buyer shall not be obligated to provide the Stockholders Representative
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this _Section 7.5_ where such access would violate any applicable Law.

8.1(b)_ shall not be available to a party if the failure of such party to

before that date.

 



64 (c) By Buyer, if (i) there is any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement,

written notice thereof is given to the Company; or (ii) the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby is permanently enjoined,
prohibited or otherwise restrained by the terms of a final, non-appealable

Agreement have been a primary cause of, or resulted in, the entry of such
order.

(d) By the Company, if (i) there is any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this

shall be of no further force and effect (except that the provisions of
_Sections 5.5_ and _5.7_ or any other provision that expressly survives the
termination of this Agreement shall survive such termination);  _provided_ ,
that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from
liability for (x) any failure by such party to perform its covenants under
this Agreement prior to the date of such termination (y) fraud or (z) an
intentional breach of this Agreement.

associated with any appraisal action or proceeding;

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer and the Company_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Article 9_ , after the Closing, Buyer and the Company,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend, and hold each Stockholder and
their respective heirs, Affiliates, and permitted successors and assigns (the
"Stockholder Group") harmless from and against all Damages suffered or paid,
directly or indirectly, as a result or arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation in or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto;

 

(ii) a breach prior to the Closing by Buyer or Merger Sub of any covenant,
agreement, or obligation of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in or made pursuant

(iii) a breach following the Closing by the Company or Buyer of any covenant,
agreement, or obligation of the Company or Buyer contained in or made pursuant
to this Agreement (a "Post-Closing Buyer Covenant"); or

 

(iv) any costs and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Group in successfully
pursuing any indemnification claims hereunder. 

(c) _Procedures Applicable to Third Party Claims_. The right of Buyer and the
Company to make a claim against the Stockholders, on the one hand, and Buyer
and the Companys obligation and liability to indemnify the Stockholders, on
the other, with respect to claims asserted by a Person (including any
Governmental Entity) other than a member of the Buyer Group or a member of
the Stockholder Group shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

(i) _Right of Indemnifying Party to Assume Defense of Claim_. The party to be
indemnified (the "Indemnified Party") shall give the other party (the
"Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of any such claim, and, subject to the
provisions of  _Section 9.2(c)_, the Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost
and expense, shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party that it is assuming defense of the claim, to assume the defense of the
claim provided that the Indemnifying Party agrees to accept liability for any
indemnity hereunder relating to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of the claim, it shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of the claim and shall defend or
settle the same.

 



67 (ii) _Control of the Defense_. The contest of the claim may be conducted
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party,
as may be appropriate. Subject to compliance by the Indemnifying Party with
the other requirements of _Section 9.2_ and this _Section 9.2(c)(ii)_,
such contest shall be conducted by counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party, but the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably
informed with respect to the claim and the contest thereof. The Indemnified
Party may participate in the defense of such claim with co-counsel of its
choice to the extent that the Indemnified Party believes in its sole
discretion that such matter shall affect its ongoing business; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (A) the Indemnifying
Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (B) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel as
provided herein, (C) the claim alleges criminal misconduct or includes a claim
for injunctive relief, or (D) a claim shall have been brought or asserted
against the Indemnifying Party as well as the Indemnified Party, and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that there may
be one or more factual or legal defenses available to it that are in conflict
with those available to the Indemnifying Party, in which case such co-counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one separate principal counsel (and any appropriate local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties. Subject to compliance by the
Indemnifying Party with the other requirements of _Section 9.2(c)(i)_ and
this _Section 9.2(c)(ii)_, if the Indemnified Party joins in any such
contest, the Indemnifying Party shall have full authority, in consultation
with the Indemnified Party, to determine all action to be taken with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any monetary judgment arising
from, the claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned (except
where the Indemnified Party shall be fully released from any liability with
respect to the claim as a result of such settlement or judgment and all
monetary damages arising out of such settlement will be paid by the
Indemnified Party). In no event shall the Indemnified Party have authority to
agree to any relief other than the payment of money Damages by the
Indemnifying Party unless agreed to by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no claims related to the matters in  _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_
may be conducted or controlled by the Indemnifying Party and all such claims
shall be controlled and conducted by Buyer and its Affiliates, except that
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not consent to a settlement of or the entry of
any monetary judgment arising from such matters, without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Representative which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(iii) _Cooperation in Defense_. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel, including permitting reasonable access to books and records and
making available its employees and representatives and those of its
Affiliates, in contesting any claim which the Indemnifying Party elects
to contest or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person
asserting the claim or any cross complaint against any Person, but the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for reasonable out of
pocket costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in so cooperating. The
Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford the
Indemnified Party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and to
participate in, conferences with all persons, including Governmental
Entities, asserting any claim against the Indemnified Party or conferences
with representatives of or counsel for such persons.

 



68 (iv) _Failure of Indemnifying Party to Assume Defense_. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the claim in accordance
with the terms hereof within 30 days after the receipt of notice thereof, the
Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, defend against the
claim in a reasonable manner, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to participate reasonably in such defense.

(v) _Compliance with Procedures_. Notwithstanding the terms of this _Article
9_ , the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article 9_ unless the Indemnified Party delivers the notice required
under  _Section 9.2(c)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
comply with the foregoing requirement shall constitute a defense to the
indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder only to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party suffers actual prejudice as the result of such
failure to comply; _provided further_ , that in no event shall a notice
delivered after expiration of the applicable time limit set forth in _Section
9.2(e)_ be valid with respect to the matter as to which such time limit
applies.

(d) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this  _Article 9_ ,
after the Closing:

(i) _General Deductible_. No claim shall be made against the Stockholders
for any Damages arising out of _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ or _(ix)_ unless and
until the total Damages for all such claims exceeds, on a cumulative basis,
$1.5 million (the "Deductible"); and then the Stockholders shall be liable
for all such Damages (including the Deductible).

(ii) _General Cap_. Buyer and Merger Subs collective rights and remedies for
indemnification arising out of _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ or _(ix)_ shall be
limited to the sum of the Indemnification Escrow Amount (the "General Cap").
The General Cap shall not apply to Damages to the extent resulting from
fraud.

(iii) _Fundamental Representations_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
limitations set forth in _Section 9.2(d)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(d)(ii)_ shall
not apply to any Damages based upon, arising out of or with respect to a
breach by the Company of any Fundamental Representation.

 

(iv) _Special Indemnification Escrow_. Buyer and Merger Subs collective
rights and remedies for indemnification arising out of _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_
shall be limited to the sum of the Special Indemnification Escrow Amount and
the Indemnification Escrow Amount. Before making any claim against the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, Buyer and Merger Sub must make any such claim
against the Special Indemnification Escrow Amount.

(v) _Overall Cap_. Buyer and Merger Subs collective rights and remedies
under or pursuant to Article 9 of this Agreement with respect to any
Stockholder shall be limited to the Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration
received by such Stockholder. This  _Section 9.2(d)(iv)_ shall not apply to
Damages to the extent resulting from fraud.

 



69 (e) _Notices to the Stockholders  Representative_. (i) Any claim made under 
_Section 9(a)(i)_ must be delivered to the Stockholders Representative prior
to the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date; (ii) any claim with respect
to a Fundamental Representation must be delivered to the Stockholders
Representative prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations; and (iii) that if raised by such anniversary or expiry, such
claim will survive such anniversary or expiry until final resolution
thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(f) _Knowledge_. No right or obligation under this _Article 9_ will be waived
or otherwise affected by any knowledge (of any form or type) of Buyer or by
any investigation, due diligence or verification by or on behalf of Buyer on
or before the date hereof or at or before Closing.

 

(g) _Notices to Buyer_. No claim with respect to any misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub as set
forth herein shall be valid unless notice of such claim is delivered by the
Stockholders Representative to Buyer prior to the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date, except that if raised by such anniversary, such claim made
under  _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ will survive such anniversary until final
resolution thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(h)  _Mitigation of Damages and Insurance_. Each party entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 9.2_ shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the Damages claimed hereunder. All calculations of the
amount of Damages for which indemnification is to be made pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_ shall take into account applicable insurance to the extent of
insurance proceeds actually recovered within 12 months following the year in
which the Damages are paid. No Indemnifying Party shall be responsible or
liable for any Damages that are punitive or that are not reasonably
foreseeable. In no event shall any member of the Buyer Group have any claim
for Damages if such claim was included in the calculation of the Closing Date
Working Capital.

(i) _Exclusive Remedies_. The rights of the parties hereto to indemnification
pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy after Closing exercisable by a party with respect to: (i)
misrepresentations in or inaccuracies of representations and warranties of the
other party or parties; (ii) breaches of any covenants; or (iii) any claims
or damages arising hereunder based on any other theory of liability, whether
in contract or tort; _provided_ , that this _Section 9.2(i)_ shall not apply
to claims to the extent based on fraud.

(j) _Release of Indemnification Escrow Amount_.

 

(i) On the first Business Day after the date that is the 12-month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Exchange Agent 50
percent of the Indemnification Escrow Amount _less_ an amount equal to the sum
of (i) the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification of the Buyer
Group pursuant to _Section 9.2_ which have been asserted prior to such date
and which either have been paid or remain pending and unresolved on such date,
and (ii) the amount necessary for payment of any expenses of the Stockholders
Representative, all in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement.

 



70 (ii) On the first Business Day after the date that is the 24-month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Exchange Agent the
remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount _less_ an amount equal
to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification of
the Buyer Group pursuant to _Section 9.2_ which have been asserted prior to
such date and which remain pending and unresolved on such date, and (ii) the
amount necessary for payment of any expenses of the Stockholders
Representative, all in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement.

(k) _Release of Special Indemnification Escrow Amount_. Except as set forth
on _Exhibit 9.2(k)_ , on the first Business Day after the date that all claims
relating to the matters in _Section 9.2(a)(vii)_ are resolved, or subject to
a final and non-appealable settlement, and any related distribution to Buyer
from the Special Indemnification Escrow Amount shall have been made, the
Escrow Agent shall release to the Exchange Agent all or any remaining portion
of the Special Indemnification Escrow Amount.

73 10.11 _Jurisdiction and Venue; Equitable Remedies_.

 

(a) _Jurisdiction and Venue_.

 

(i) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself or himself and its or his property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the
Delaware Court of Chancery or any such Delaware State or Federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. Each party agrees not to commence a claim or proceeding hereunder in a
court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or any Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, except if such party has first brought such
claim or proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any such
Delaware State or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and both the
Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware State and Federal courts located
in the State of Delaware have denied jurisdiction over such claim or
proceeding.

 

(ii) Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to the Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery or any Delaware State court or Federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware. Each of the parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

 

(iii) Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any right it may have to
a trial by jury in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto.

 

(b) _Enforcement_. The provisions of this _Section 10.11_ may be enforced by
any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party prevailing in such action
shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including
attorneys fees and expenses to be paid by the party against whom enforcement
is ordered.

 

(c) _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

 



74 10.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all costs and
expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that Buyer shall be responsible for all filing and other similar
fees payable in connection with any filings or submissions of the parties
hereto under the HSR Act.

 

10.13 _No Liability for Forward Looking Statements; No Additional Warranties
or Representations; Due Diligence_. Buyer and its Affiliates acknowledge that
neither the Company, nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company or its Business, which has been
communicated, furnished or made available to any of Buyer or its Affiliates
or their respective agents, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
and the documents contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor any other
Person shall have or be subject to any liability to any Indemnified Party or
any other Person resulting solely from the distribution to any of Buyer or its
Affiliates or their respective agents, or any of Buyer or its Affiliates or
their respective agents use of, any such information, documents or material
made available to any of Buyer and its Affiliates or their respective agents
in records stored on computer disks, in online or physical "data rooms,"
provided during management presentations or in any other forms in expectation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent expressly
covered under this Agreement. Buyer and its Affiliates acknowledge and agree
that none of Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their respective agents has
relied, and none of such Persons is relying, upon any statement, warranty or
representation (whether written or oral) not made in or pursuant to the
Agreement. Buyer and its Affiliates further acknowledge and agree that (a)
they have conducted such investigations of the Company and its Business as
they deem necessary in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) they and their
respective agents have been permitted access to the records, facilities,
equipment, Tax Returns, Contracts and other properties and assets of the
Company which they and their respective agents have desired and requested to
see or review and (c) they and their respective agents have had an
opportunity to meet with the Company and its agents to discuss the businesses
and assets of the Company. In connection with such investigation, Buyer and
its Affiliates and their respective agents have received from or on behalf of
the Company certain estimates, budgets, forecasts, plans and financial
projections ("Forward-Looking Statements"), and Buyer and its Affiliates
acknowledge that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in making Forward-
Looking Statements, and (ii) they are familiar with such uncertainties and,
except as set forth in this Agreement, are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-
Looking Statements so furnished to them and their respective agents (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying Forward-Looking Statements
where such assumptions are explicitly disclosed). Except as set forth in this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any other Person is making any
representation or warranty with respect to, or shall have or be subject to
any liability to any indemnified Person, or any other Person resulting from,
the distribution to any of Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective agents,
or its use of, Forward-Looking Statements.

10.14 _Guaranty Regarding Buyer s Obligations_. C.H. Robinson Worldwide,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor") and Affiliate of Buyer, to
induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment and
performance when due of any and all of Buyers obligations, covenants,
agreements and other Liabilities under the Agreement (collectively, the
"Obligations"). Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Company refuses
to enter into the Agreement or to

 



75  consummate the transactions contemplated herein unless Guarantor provides
this guaranty and that Guarantor will benefit personally from the Company
entering into this Agreement and consummating such transactions. If Closing
occurs, then this Guaranty automatically will expire and be of no force or
effect at the end of the Closing Date.
