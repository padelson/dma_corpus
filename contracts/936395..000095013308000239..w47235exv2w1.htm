<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ciena has filed all reports required to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) during the last twelve months (the &#147;SEC Filings&#148;). The SEC Filings (i)&nbsp;were
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;did not, at the time they were filed, contain any untrue statements
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Since the date of Ciena&#146;s last periodic report filed with the SEC there has
been no event that has resulted in, or development that would reasonably be expected to result in,
a Ciena Material Adverse Effect. The financial statements (including the related notes) of Ciena
included in the SEC Filings complied, when filed, as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form&nbsp;10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Ciena and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments and the
absence of footnotes).

405 promulgated under the Securities Act (&#147;WKSI&#148;). To the Knowledge of Ciena, no reason currently

threatened against or involving either of the Buyer Parties or their respective Assets or the
business and operations, at law or in equity, or before or by any court, arbitrator or Governmental

under proceedings that have been disclosed in Ciena&#146;s SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof,
neither of the Buyer Parties are operating, nor are any of them subject to any judgment, writ,
order, injunction, award or decree of any court, judge, justice or magistrate, including any

municipal or other Governmental Entity nor has any notice or proceeding with respect to thereof
been given or commenced nor is Ciena aware of any intent or proposal to give any such notice or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Company will adopt, or will cause to be adopted, all necessary corporate resolutions
to terminate the Company 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, and any other 401(k) Plan maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Company 401(k) Plans&#148;), effective as of no later
than one (1)&nbsp;day prior to Closing. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make
all necessary payments to fund the contributions: (i)&nbsp;necessary or required to maintain the
tax-qualified status of the Company 401(k) Plans; (ii)&nbsp;for elective deferrals made pursuant to the
Company 401(k) Plans for the period prior to termination; and (iii)&nbsp;for employer matching
contributions for the period prior to termination. A 401(k) Plan
means a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) sponsored and maintained by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, which includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement, as defined in Section
401(k) of the Code. The Company shall provide Ciena with a copy of resolutions duly adopted by the
Company&#146;s (or the Company Subsidiaries&#146;s as applicable) board of directors terminating the 401(k)
Plan. Ciena will take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that Ciena&#146;s 401(k) Plan
will permit Company employees to make individual rollover contributions to Ciena&#146;s 401(k) Plan of
any &#147;eligible rollover distributions,&#148; as such term is defined in Ciena&#146;s 401(k) Plan, distributed
by the Company 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, Continuing Employees (as defined
below) will be eligible to participate in the Ciena 401(k) Plan.

Subsidiaries who continue employment with Ciena or its Subsidiaries (&#147;Continuing Employees&#148;) to
either (i)&nbsp;participate in the benefit plans of Ciena (&#147;Ciena Benefit Plans&#148;) on terms no less
favorable in the aggregate than those offered to similarly situated employees of Ciena, and Ciena
shall ensure that Continuing Employees who are actually employed and currently working for the
Company at the Effective Time do not have a lapse of coverage in the transition from Company
Benefit Plans to Ciena Benefit Plans, (ii)&nbsp;continue (or cause the Surviving Company to continue) to
maintain the Company Benefit Plans on substantially the same terms as in effect prior to the
Effective Time, or (iii)&nbsp;a combination of clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii)&nbsp;so that each Continuing Employee
will have benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Ciena under Ciena Benefit Plans. For purposes of any length of
service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods, entitlement to benefits, vacation accruals
or differential benefits based on length of service under any Ciena Benefit Plan (including the
Ciena 401(k) Plan), other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan, for which a
Continuing Employee may be eligible after the Closing Date, Ciena shall ensure that service by such
Continuing Employee with the Company shall be deemed to have been service with Ciena. All vacation
accrued by Continuing Employees under the vacation policies of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
predecessors shall be carried over by Ciena and shall be permitted to be maintained up to the
levels permitted under the applicable policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries or predecessors.
Ciena shall waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions (or actively at work or
similar limitations), evidence of insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under any medical, dental and vision plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date to the extent such limitations, exclusions or requirements
were waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date. Ciena shall
also provide

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to any claims or demands by third parties as to which Ciena may seek
indemnification hereunder, whenever Ciena will have received a written notice that such a claim or
demand has been asserted or threatened, Ciena will promptly notify the Stockholders&#146; Representative
of such claim or demand and of the facts within Ciena&#146;s knowledge that relate thereto within a
reasonable time after receiving such written notice; provided that failure to give notice promptly
shall not limit Ciena&#146;s indemnification rights hereunder, except to the extent the Stockholders are
actually prejudiced by such failure to give timely notice. The Stockholders&#146; Representative will
then have the right to defend, contest, negotiate or settle any such claim or demand through
counsel of his own selection (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Ciena), at the Stockholders&#146;
own cost and expense, which costs and expenses will be payable out of the Reimbursement Fund and
the Escrow Fund as provided for in the Escrow Agreement and Ciena shall cooperate with and assist
the Stockholders&#146; Representative in the defense of such claim or demand. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the Stockholders&#146; Representative will not settle, compromise, or offer to
settle or compromise any such claim or demand without the prior written consent of Ciena, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the Stockholders&#146;
Representative elects to defend against, contest, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any such
claim or demand, (i)&nbsp;Ciena, prior to or during the period in which the Stockholders&#146; Representative
assumes the defense of such claim or demand, may take such reasonable actions as Ciena deems
necessary to preserve any and all rights with respect to such matter, without such actions being
construed as a waiver of Ciena&#146;s rights to defense and indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
(ii)&nbsp;the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed that they shall indemnify Ciena for such
claim or demand pursuant to, and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the
provisions of this <B>Article&nbsp;VI </B>and (iii)&nbsp;Ciena may participate, at its own expense, in the defense
of such claim or demand; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Ciena shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Stockholders if, (A)&nbsp;so
requested by the Stockholders&#146; Representative to participate, or (B)&nbsp;in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to Ciena, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Stockholders and Ciena that
would make such separate representation advisable. If the Stockholders&#146; Representative gives
notice to Ciena within twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days after Ciena has notified the Stockholders&#146;
Representative that any such claim or demand has been made in writing that the Stockholders&#146;
Representative elects to have Ciena defend, contest, negotiate, or settle any such claim or demand,
or if the Stockholders&#146; Representatives does not promptly assume the defense of any such claim or
demand or, after doing so, fails to continue to diligently and vigorously prosecute the defense in
good faith, or if&nbsp;the claim or demand, based on the remedy being sought, could result in criminal
liability of, or equitable remedies, against, then Ciena will have the right to contest and/or
settle any such claim or demand and the Stockholders&#146; Representative shall cooperate with and
assist Ciena in the defense of such claim or demand. In the event that the Stockholders&#146;
Representative has consented to any settlement, the Stockholders shall have no power or authority
to object under any provision of this Agreement to the amount of such settlement. In the event a
third party is awarded any special, consequential, incidental or punitive damages, the Indemnified
Party can recover such damages as Losses from the Stockholders pursuant to this <B>Article
&nbsp;VI</B>, but in
no other event shall an Indemnified Party be entitled to recover any special, consequential,
incidental or punitive damages from the Stockholders.
