 The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein and by Law.

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Ciena, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of the Company Capital Stock (the "Stockholders"), the following will occur:

 (2) _Series 2 Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series 2 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive either: (A) if the sum of (x) the Per Share Series 2 Liquidation Preference and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration is less than $3.24, such sum; or (B) if the sum of (x) the Per Share Series 2 

    ##### 

  

    

Liquidation Preference and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration is
greater than equal to $3.24, the greater of either (I) $3.24 or (II) the Per

a combination of cash and shares of Ciena Common Stock, with each holder of
Series 2 Preferred Stock receiving a number of shares of Ciena Common Stock
per share of Series 2 Preferred Stock equal to the Series 2 Exchange Ratio,
the value of which per share shall be the Ciena Average Closing Price, and
the balance of such consideration consisting of cash. 

   

 (3) _Series 3 Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series 3 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive either: (A) if the sum of (x) the Per Share Series 3 Liquidation Preference and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration is less than $3.24, such sum; or (B) if the sum of (x) the Per Share Series 3 Liquidation Preference and (y) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration is greater than or equal to $3.24, the greater of either (I) $3.24 or (II) the Per Share Common Merger Consideration (after recalculation). The consideration payable in respect of each share of Series 3 Preferred Stock shall be paid in a combination of cash and shares of Ciena Common Stock, with each holder of Series 3 Preferred Stock receiving a number of shares of Ciena Common Stock per share of Series 3 Preferred Stock equal to the Series 3 Exchange Ratio, the value of which per share shall be the Ciena Average Closing Price, and the balance of such consideration consisting of cash. 

   

 (4) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Common Merger Consideration. The consideration payable in respect of the Company Common Stock shall be paid in cash. 

   

 (5) _Limitation on Total Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate cash consideration payable or allocable to Company Equity Holders pursuant to this Sections 1.5(c) and Section 4.7 exceed $200 million in cash (as such amount may be increased to reflect the Aggregate Exercise Prices and reduced to reflect any Excess Transaction Expenses or Excess Debt) (the "Maximum Cash Amount") and in no event shall the aggregate number of shares of Ciena Common Stock payable or allocable to Company Equity Holders pursuant to this Sections 1.5(c) and Section 4.7 exceed 3,400,000 shares of Ciena Common Stock (as such amount may be reduced to reflect Excess Transaction Expenses and Excess Debt) (the "Maximum Stock Amount"). In the event the application of Sections 1.5(c) and 4.7 would result in the aggregate cash consideration payable or allocable to Company Equity Holders exceeding the Maximum Cash Amount or the aggregate number of shares of Ciena Common Stock payable or allocable to Company Equity Holders exceeding the Maximum Stock Amount, appropriate action shall be taken by the parties hereto, in accordance with applicable Laws, to adjust the payment or allocation of the Maximum Stock Amount and the Maximum Cash Amount (provided such adjustment does not increase the Maximum Stock Amount or Maximum Cash Amount) among the Company Equity Holders as is equitable under the circumstances (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, 

    #####

Such Stockholders shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the portions of the Aggregate Merger Consideration specified in Section 1.5, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.8, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced by such Dissenting Shares less the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration allocable to such Stockholder that has been deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Reimbursement Fund in respect of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Sections 1.8(b) and 6.2.

Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates for cancellation, together with the Letter of Transmittal duly executed, such holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Ciena Common Stock into which the Company Capital Stock represented by the surrendered Certificate shall have been converted at the Effective Time (less such holders portion of the Escrow Shares to be deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Reimbursement Fund by Ciena as set forth on the Spreadsheet), (B) the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(c) (less such holders portion of the Escrow Cash to be deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Reimbursement Fund by Ciena as set forth on the Spreadsheet), (C) cash in lieu of any fractional share of Ciena Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.9 and (D) certain dividends and distributions in accordance with Section 1.8(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall then be canceled. Subject to Section 1.8(c) and Section 1.9, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8(b), each Certificate, from and after the Effective Time, shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration into which such Company Capital Stock shall have been converted. Ciena and the Company will consult and cooperate with each other prior to the Closing with the aim of expediting the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration on or promptly after the Effective Time to parties entitled to such Aggregate Merger Consolidation under Section 1.5. Prior to the Effective Time, Ciena shall provide to any Stockholder who is to receive in excess of $500,000 in cash and/or Ciena Common Stock in connection with the Merger, upon the written or email request of such Stockholder (or the Company on behalf of such Stockholder), a Letter of Transmittal, and any such Stockholder who shall deliver a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and the other items set forth in this Section 1.8(b) to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Closing Date shall receive the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration such Stockholder is entitled to receive hereunder within three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2, Ciena shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 6.2) the Escrow Amount and (y) $350,000 (the "Reimbursement Amount"). 

   

 (c) Until a holder of Company Capital Stock entitled by reason of the Merger to receive certificates representing Ciena Common Stock shall have surrendered its Certificates pursuant to this Section 1.8, no dividends or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Ciena Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, such holder shall be paid, in each case, without interest, (i) the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of Ciena Common Stock represented by the certificate received by such holder and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment 

    ##### 

  

    

date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Ciena Common Stock
and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date on or after such surrender. 

   

 (d) If any certificate representing shares of Ciena Common Stock or any cash is to be issued or paid to any Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such exchange that such surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and such Person either (i) shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of the issuance of such certificates of Ciena Common Stock and the distribution of such cash payment to such Person or (ii) shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Ciena or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock such amounts as Ciena or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Ciena or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Ciena or the Exchange Agent. All amounts in respect of taxes received or withheld by Ciena shall be remitted or paid by Ciena in accordance with the Code or such state, local or foreign tax Law, as applicable. 

   

 (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and payment of any surety premium fee as may be required by the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Ciena Common Stock as determined under Section 1.5(c), pay any cash required under Section 1.5(c), and pay any cash, dividends and distributions as determined in accordance with Section 1.8(c) and Section 1.9 in respect of such Certificate. 

   

 (f) At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.9. _No Fractional Shares._  

  

 No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Ciena Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and such a fractional share shall not entitle the record or beneficial owner thereof to vote or to any other rights as a stockholder of Ciena. In lieu of receiving any such fractional share, each holder of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise have been entitled thereto upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange will receive cash (without interest) in an amount rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of Ciena Common Stock on The NASDAQ Global Select 

    ##### 

  

    

Market at the close of trading immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
(ii) the fractional share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
Ciena shall make available to the Exchange Agent the cash necessary for this
purpose. 

   

 SECTION 1.10. _Return of Exchange Fund._  

  

 Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Capital Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Date shall be delivered to Ciena, upon its request, and any such former holders who have not theretofore surrendered to the Exchange Agent their Certificates in compliance herewith shall thereafter look only to Ciena for payment of their claim for their portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any shares of Ciena Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Ciena Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Ciena Common Stock. Neither Ciena nor the Company shall be liable to any former holder of Company Capital Stock for any cash or shares of Ciena Common Stock held in the Exchange Fund (and any cash, dividends and distributions payable in respect thereof) that is delivered to a public official pursuant to an official request under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.11. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock._  

  

 All cash and shares of Ciena Common Stock delivered upon the surrender for exchange of any Certificate in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.9) shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Certificate. 

   

 SECTION 1.12. _Further Assurances._  

  

 If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Company, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or Assets of the Company or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Company and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or Assets of the Company, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

    ##### 

  

    

any antitrust or competition Law, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of Ciena will be required
with respect to any matter set forth in the Agreement to the extent the
requirement of such consent would violate any applicable Law. 

   

 SECTION 4.3. _Access; Documents; Supplemental Information._  

  

 (a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing and subject to the Confidentiality Agreements and applicable Law, the Company shall (subject to contractual or regulatory confidentiality limitations) afford, and, with respect to clause (ii) below, shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the independent certified public accountants for the Company to afford, (i) to the officers, independent certified public accountants, counsel and other representatives of Ciena, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access at all reasonable times to the properties, books and records including tax returns filed and those in preparation of the Company and the right to consult with the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the Company in order that Ciena may have full opportunity to make such investigations as it shall deem necessary of the operations, properties, business, financial condition and prospects of the Company, (ii) to the independent certified public accountants of Ciena, reasonable access at all reasonable times to the work papers and other records of the accountants relating to the Company, and (iii) to Ciena and its representatives, such additional financial and operating data and other information as to the properties, operations, business, financial condition and prospects of the Company as Ciena shall from time to time require. 

   

 (b) From the date of this Agreement through and including the Closing, the Company will furnish to Ciena copies of any notices, documents, requests, court papers, or other materials received from any governmental agency or any other third party with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 4.4. _Registration._  

  

 (a) The shares of Ciena Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Ciena shall file on the Closing Date or next Business Day thereafter, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter, a registration statement on Form S-3 (which such form shall be an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, to the extent available for use by Ciena), or such successor form as may be appropriate to be filed with the SEC by Ciena under the Securities Act (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, whether prior to or after the effective date thereof , the "Registration Statement"), covering the public resale in the United States of the shares of Ciena Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 in the Merger and upon exercise of the Company Warrants assumed by Ciena pursuant to Section 4.7(e) hereof, and Ciena shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Effective Period"). Cienas obligations under this Section 4.4 to include a Stockholders shares of Ciena Common Stock in the Registration Statement are contingent upon such Stockholder providing promptly all information concerning the Stockholder and its proposed plan of distribution as Ciena may reasonably request in connection with any of the foregoing. Ciena may by written notice to the Stockholders immediately suspend the use of 

       ##### 

  

    

any resale prospectus for a period not to exceed twenty (20) consecutive days
in any one instance and for a period not to exceed forty-five (45) days in
any six-month period (each, a "Suspension Period") at any time that (i) Ciena
becomes engaged in a material business activity or negotiation or any other
event has occurred or is anticipated, which activity, negotiation or event is
not disclosed in that prospectus and that Cienas board of directors (or a
committee thereof) reasonably believes after consultation with counsel
should be disclosed therein under applicable Law and determines in good faith
that such disclosure would be premature or would adversely affect Ciena
or its business or prospects; _provided_ , _however_ , that Ciena may not
suspend the use of any resale prospectus during the 20 consecutive trading day
period commencing on the effective date of the Registration Statement unless
Cienas board of directors (or a committee thereof) concludes that any
previously issued financial statements included in, or incorporated by
reference into, such resale prospectus should no longer be relied upon
because of an error in such financial statements as addressed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 20, as may be modified, supplemented or
succeeded. Ciena will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the use
of the Registration Statement may be resumed immediately following any such
Suspension Period. Any Stockholder selling Ciena Common Stock registered on
the Registration Statement shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify Ciena,
each person, if any, who controls Ciena within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of Ciena, each underwriter and each
person who controls any underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act
against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including any loss,
damage, claim or liability under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities laws or otherwise) arising out of or based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arising out of
or based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading and such Stockholder will reimburse Ciena and each such
officer, director and underwriter and controlling person for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating
or defending such loss, claim, damage, liability or action,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Stockholder shall only be liable hereunder in any
such case if and only to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration
Statement, preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or any such amendment
or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information pertaining
to such Stockholder, as such, as furnished in writing to Ciena by or on
behalf of such Stockholder specifically for use in the preparation thereof,
provided, further, however, that the liability of each Stockholder hereunder
shall not in any event exceed the net proceeds received by such Stockholder
from the sale of shares of Ciena Common Stock covered by the Registration
Statement. Ciena will indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder selling
Ciena Common Stock registered on the Registration Statement, each underwriter
of such Ciena Common Stock thereunder and each other person, if any, who
controls such Stockholder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
joint or several, to which such Stockholder, underwriter or controlling
person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities laws or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise
out of or are based 

     ##### 

  

    

upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and Ciena will reimburse each such Stockholder, each such
underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Ciena will not be liable hereunder in any such case to the extent that any
such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in the Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in
conformity with information pertaining to such Stockholder, as such, as
furnished in writing to Ciena by or on behalf of such Stockholder specifically
for use in the preparation thereof. Ciena shall bear all costs and expenses
associated with the registration of the Ciena Common Stock as specified in
this Section 4.4 and the preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement, Cienas outside counsel, NASDAQ and blue sky registration and
filing fees and transfer agents and registrars fees, but not including
underwriting commissions or similar charges and legal fees and disbursements
of counsel to the selling Stockholders. 

   

 (b) At its expense, Ciena will use reasonable best efforts during the Effective Period to: 

   

 (1) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement; 

  

 (2) Furnish such number of prospectuses and any amendments or supplements thereto, as a Stockholder from time to time may reasonably request; 

  

 (3) Promptly amend the registration statement onto a form Ciena is then eligible to use or file a new registration statement on such form and to keep such registration statement effective in accordance with the requirements otherwise applicable under this Agreement if Ciena ceases to be a WKSI; 

  

 (4) Make and keep adequate current public information with respect to Ciena available in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act; and 

  

 (5) File with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of Ciena under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements. 

  

 (c) This Section 4.4 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit the holders of Company Capital Stock that receive Ciena Common Stock on account of the Merger, shall be binding on Ciena and its successors and assigns, and shall be enforceable by such holders. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 4.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification._  

  

 (a) The Company and the Buyer Parties each shall from the date hereof until the Effective Time cooperate with the other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity, including filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone calls and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the Merger shall include representatives of both Ciena and the Company. Subject to applicable Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger by or on behalf of any party. Ciena and the Company will each first advise and consult with the other regarding any understandings, undertakings, agreements (oral or written) or arguments that the first party proposes to make with or to or enter into with any Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over or rights of review with respect to antitrust Laws, in connection with the Merger, and each of the Buyer Parties and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to seek to resolve any objections to the Merger as may be asserted by a Governmental Entity under applicable Laws. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, nothing herein shall require either of the Buyer Parties, in connection with the receipt of any regulatory approval, to agree to sell or divest any material assets or business or agree to restrict in any material way any business conducted by or proposed to be conducted by either of the Buyer Parties in connection with the Merger. 

   

 (b) The Company and Ciena each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, executive officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Information Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Ciena, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) The Company and Ciena each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) The Company shall submit to the Stockholders for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Ciena), by such number of Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that Ciena and the Company reasonably determine may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Ciena evidence reasonably satisfactory to Ciena that (A) a stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with 

     ##### 

  

    

Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite
stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or
benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote (the "280G Approval"), or
(B) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that
such "parachute payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to the
waivers of those payments and/or benefits which were executed by the affected
individuals prior to such Stockholder vote. 

   

 SECTION 4.6. _NASDAQ Listing._  

  

 To the extent required by the rules of NASDAQ, as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event prior to the Effective Time, Ciena shall list on the NASDAQ Global Select Market the shares of Ciena Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger and upon exercise of Company Options and the Company Warrants. 

   

 SECTION 4.7. _Company Options; Company Warrants._  

  

 (a) Concurrent with the Effective Time, each Company Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Stock Plan shall together with the Company Stock Plan, be assumed by Ciena and shall thereby be converted into an option (an "Assumed Option") to purchase the number of shares of Ciena Common Stock (decreased to the nearest full share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Ciena Common Stock (increased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option Exchange Ratio. Except for the foregoing adjustments and for any modifications to the terms and conditions of Assumed Options held by Key Employees pursuant to the terms of the Key Employee Agreements, all of the terms and conditions in effect for each Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue in effect following the assumption of such option in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (b) It is the intention of the parties that the Company Options so assumed by Ciena shall qualify, immediately after the Effective Time, as "Incentive Stock Options" under Section 422 of the Code to the same extent those options qualified as such Incentive Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time. The adjustments provided herein with respect to any Company Options that are Incentive Stock Options shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code, and any Company Option that is not an Incentive Stock Option shall be adjusted in a manner to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

   

 (c) Ciena shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Ciena Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Assumed Options and the Company Warrants. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Ciena shall deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to Cienas stock option plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Assumed Options and that such Assumed Options shall continue in effect on the same 

    ##### 

  

    

terms and conditions as the Company Options (subject to the adjustment set
forth in Section 4.7(a)). 

   

 (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Ciena shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares subject to the Assumed Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus required thereby shall be maintained in accordance with the relevant requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) at least for so long as any Assumed Options remain outstanding. 

   

 (e) Concurrent with the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is then outstanding and exercisable described in Schedule 2.3(a) and that by its terms did not expire as of the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder, shall be deemed assumed by Ciena and shall constitute a warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Warrant, cash and a number of shares of Ciena Common Stock, equivalent to the amount the holder of such Company Warrant would have received had such Company Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts with respect to the Company Warrants to permit the assumption of the unexercised Company Warrants by Ciena pursuant to this Section 4.7(e). 

   

 SECTION 4.8. _Notification of Certain Matters._  

  

 The Company shall give prompt notice to Ciena, and Ciena shall give prompt notice to the Company (to the extent Known by the Company or Known by Ciena, as applicable) of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that causes (i) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in any material respect; and (b) any failure of the Company or Ciena, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement in any material respect; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 

   

 SECTION 4.9. _Indemnification._  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, Ciena shall fulfill the obligations of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to indemnify each person who is or was a director or officer of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries against losses such person may incur based upon matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time pursuant to any applicable indemnification agreements and any indemnification provision of the Company Certificate or its bylaws (and the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Companys Subsidiaries) as each is in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the indemnified parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which 

     ##### 

  

    

provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company prior to the Effective Time. For a period
of six years after the Effective Time, Ciena will maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy (or a
policy on substantially similar terms) covering those persons who as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy for matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, provided that Ciena shall not be
required to pay an annual premium therefor in excess of 200% of the last
annual premium paid for the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance prior to the date of this Agreement but shall, in such
event, maintain as much coverage as can be purchased for such amount;
provided further, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of Ciena under this Section 4.9(a) may be satisfied by Ciena or
the Company purchasing a "tail" policy (the "Tail Policy") under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has an effective
term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time are covered by the Companys
directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for
actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
contains terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable
to the insured than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance
policy in effect as of the date hereof. 

   

 (b) In the event a current or former director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries are entitled to indemnification under this Section 4.9, such director or officer shall be entitled to reimbursement from Ciena (from and after the Closing Date) for reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by such director or officer in pursuing such indemnification, including payment of such fees and expenses by Ciena, in advance of the final disposition of such action upon receipt of an undertaking by such current or former director or officer to repay such payment if it shall be adjudicated that such current or former director or officer was not entitled to such payment. 

   

 (c) If Ciena or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and Assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Ciena assume, as a matter of Law or otherwise, the obligations set forth in this Section 4.9. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this Section 4.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person who is or was a director or officer of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such persons shall have any right of indemnification or contribution, or any right of advancement of expenses from Ciena with respect to any Loss that is indemnifiable by the Stockholders pursuant to Section 6.2. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 4.10. _Employee Benefits Matters._  

  

 (a) The Company will adopt, or will cause to be adopted, all necessary corporate resolutions to terminate the Company 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, and any other 401(k) Plan maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company 401(k) Plans"), effective as of no later than one (1) day prior to Closing. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will make all necessary payments to fund the contributions: (i) necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of the Company 401(k) Plans; (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to the Company 401(k) Plans for the period prior to termination; and (iii) for employer matching contributions for the period prior to termination. A 401(k) Plan means a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) sponsored and maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries, which includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement, as defined in Section 401(k) of the Code. The Company shall provide Ciena with a copy of resolutions duly adopted by the Companys (or the Company Subsidiariess as applicable) board of directors terminating the 401(k) Plan. Ciena will take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that Cienas 401(k) Plan will permit Company employees to make individual rollover contributions to Cienas 401(k) Plan of any "eligible rollover distributions," as such term is defined in Cienas 401(k) Plan, distributed by the Company 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, Continuing Employees (as defined below) will be eligible to participate in the Ciena 401(k) Plan. 

   

 (b) Following the Closing Date, Ciena shall arrange for employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue employment with Ciena or its Subsidiaries ("Continuing Employees") to either (i) participate in the benefit plans of Ciena ("Ciena Benefit Plans") on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than those offered to similarly situated employees of Ciena, and Ciena shall ensure that Continuing Employees who are actually employed and currently working for the Company at the Effective Time do not have a lapse of coverage in the transition from Company Benefit Plans to Ciena Benefit Plans, (ii) continue (or cause the Surviving Company to continue) to maintain the Company Benefit Plans on substantially the same terms as in effect prior to the Effective Time, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii) so that each Continuing Employee will have benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Ciena under Ciena Benefit Plans. For purposes of any length of service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods, entitlement to benefits, vacation accruals or differential benefits based on length of service under any Ciena Benefit Plan (including the Ciena 401(k) Plan), other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan, for which a Continuing Employee may be eligible after the Closing Date, Ciena shall ensure that service by such Continuing Employee with the Company shall be deemed to have been service with Ciena. All vacation accrued by Continuing Employees under the vacation policies of the Company or its Subsidiaries or predecessors shall be carried over by Ciena and shall be permitted to be maintained up to the levels permitted under the applicable policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries or predecessors. Ciena shall waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions (or actively at work or similar limitations), evidence of insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any medical, dental and vision plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date to the extent such limitations, exclusions or requirements were waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date. Ciena shall also provide 

    ##### 

  

    

Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-
payments, deductibles, offsets and maximum out-of-pocket requirements (or
similar payments) made under the Company Benefit Plans for the year in which
the Closing occurs under Cienas medical, dental and vision plans for the
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, maximum out-
of-pocket requirements or similar requirements under any Ciena Benefit Plan in

 (i) _Removal of Stockholders  Representative; Authority of Successor Stockholders Representative_. Stockholders who in the aggregate hold at least a majority of the Stockholders interest in the Escrow Fund shall have the right at any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement to remove the then-acting Stockholders Representative and to appoint a successor Stockholders Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither such removal of the then acting Stockholders Representative nor such appointment of a successor Stockholders Representative shall be effective until the delivery to the Escrow Agent of executed counterparts of a writing signed by each such Stockholder with respect to such removal and appointment, together with an acknowledgment signed by the successor Stockholders Representative 

    #####

The Stockholders (i) shall have no claim or cause of action against, may not assert any claim against, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders Representative and each of its Affiliates and any of their respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, as provided for in Section 6.3(c) above; and (ii) shall pay to the Stockholders Representative, promptly upon request, such Stockholders pro rata share of any amounts paid by the Stockholders Representative on behalf of the Stockholders and all costs and expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors fees and expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Stockholders Representative in connection with the protection, defense or enforcement of any rights under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to the extent such costs, expenses and other amounts exceed the amount available to the Stockholders Representative in the Reimbursement Fund. 

   

 (k) _Irrevocable Appointment_. Subject to Section 6.3(k) the appointment of the Stockholders Representative hereunder is irrevocable and any action taken by the Stockholders Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Section 6.3 shall be effective and absolutely binding on the Company and each stockholder thereof notwithstanding any contrary action of, or direction from, the Company or any Stockholder, except for actions taken by the Stockholders Representative that are in bad faith. 

   

 (l) _Ciena s Reliance_. Ciena shall not be obliged to inquire into the authority of the Stockholders Representative, and Ciena shall be fully protected in dealing with the Stockholders Representative in good faith. 

   

 (m) _Binding Appointment_. The provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation Article VI hereof, shall be binding upon each Stockholder and the executors, heirs, legal representatives and successors of each Stockholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Stockholder or the Stockholders shall mean and include the successors to the Stockholders rights hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 SECTION 6.4. _Defense of Third-Party Claims._  

  

 With respect to any claims or demands by third parties as to which Ciena may seek indemnification hereunder, whenever Ciena will have received a written notice that such a claim or demand has been asserted or threatened, Ciena will promptly notify the Stockholders Representative of such claim or demand and of the facts within Cienas knowledge that relate thereto within a reasonable time after receiving such written notice; provided that failure to give notice promptly shall not limit Cienas indemnification rights hereunder, except to the extent the Stockholders are actually prejudiced by such failure to give timely notice. The Stockholders Representative will then have the right to defend, contest, negotiate or settle any such claim or demand through counsel of his own selection (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Ciena), at the Stockholders own cost and expense, which costs and expenses will be payable out of the Reimbursement Fund and the Escrow Fund as provided for in the Escrow Agreement and Ciena shall cooperate with and assist the Stockholders Representative in the defense of such claim or demand.

If the Stockholders Representative gives notice to Ciena within twenty (20) Business Days after Ciena has notified the Stockholders Representative that any such claim or demand has been made in writing that the Stockholders Representative elects to have Ciena defend, contest, negotiate, or settle any such claim or demand, or if the Stockholders Representatives does not promptly assume the defense of any such claim or demand or, after doing so, fails to continue to diligently and vigorously prosecute the defense in good faith, or if the claim or demand, based on the remedy being sought, could result in criminal liability of, or equitable remedies, against, then Ciena will have the right to contest and/or settle any such claim or demand and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate with and assist Ciena in the defense of such claim or demand. In the event that the Stockholders Representative has consented to any settlement, the Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this Agreement to the amount of such settlement.
