2 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON UNITS

Section 2.1 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of JPE GP, JPE, AMID GP, AMID or the
holder of any securities of JPE:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _2.1(c)_ , 
_Section_ _ _ _2.2(h)_ and _Section_ _ _ _2.4_ , (i) each Common Unit and
Subordinated Unit issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding in
accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.3_ as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Common Units and Subordinated Units held by an ArcLight
Affiliate or GP Sub) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.5775 (the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") AMID Units (the " _Public Unit Consideration_ "), and
(ii) each Common Unit and Subordinated Unit issued and outstanding or deemed
issued and outstanding in accordance with _Section 2.3_ held by Lonestar
Midstream Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, JP Energy
Development LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or their respective Affiliates
(each, an " _ArcLight Affiliate_ "), as of Closing shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.5225 AMID Units (the " _Affiliate Unit Consideration_ "
and, together with the Public Unit Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_
"). The GP Sub Common Units held by GP Sub will remain outstanding in the
Surviving Entity and GP Sub will continue as a limited partner in the
Surviving Entity.

(b) _Cancellation of JPE Incentive Distribution Rights and the JPE
General Partner Interest_. As of the Effective Time, the JPE Incentive
Distribution Rights outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange for such
cancelled JPE Incentive Distribution Rights. Upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the GP Merger Agreement and the designation of GP
Sub as the general partner of the Surviving Entity in accordance with Section
1.5(b), the JPE General Partner Interest shall cease to exist as provided for
in the GP Merger Agreement.

 

(c) _Cancellation of JPE-Owned Units_. Any JPE Securities that are owned
immediately prior to the Effective Time by JPE or any Subsidiary of JPE shall
be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange for such canceled JPE Securities.

 

(d) _Conversion of the Membership Interests in Merger Sub_. At the Merger
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
AMID, JPE or AMID Merger Sub, the membership interests in AMID Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be
converted into common units of JPE (as the Surviving Entity), representing
99.9% of the aggregate partnership interest (as defined in the DRULPA) of all
limited partners in the Surviving Entity, and AMID and GP Sub shall be
admitted as the only limited partners of the Surviving Entity. At
the Effective Time, the books and records of JPE (as the Surviving Entity)
shall be revised to reflect the admission of AMID and GP Sub as the only
limited partners of the Surviving Entity and the simultaneous withdrawal of
all other JPE Limited Partners.

(e) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units and
Subordinated Units converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) (a " _Certificate_ ") or
evidence of units in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Units or Subordinated
Units shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2(g)_ to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit
in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_ , without interest, and the right to
be admitted as an AMID Limited Partner. AMID GP hereby consents to the
admission (as an AMID Limited Partner) of each JPE Unitholder who is issued
AMID Units in accordance with this _Article II_ , upon the proper surrender of
the Certificate or Book-Entry Unit representing Common Units or Subordinated
Units. Upon such surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Unit and the
recording of the name of such Person as a limited partner of AMID on the books
and records of AMID, such Person shall automatically and effective as of the
Effective Time be admitted as an AMID Limited Partner and be bound by the
AMID Partnership Agreement as such. By its surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Unit, or by its acceptance of AMID Units, as applicable, a JPE
Unitholder confirms its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the AMID Partnership Agreement.

 



3 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, AMID shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to JPE (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates or Book-Entry Units for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but
in no event more than three business days following the Effective Time, AMID
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record
of Common Units and Subordinated Units as of the Effective Time (and, to the
extent commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand,
during customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, if so elected by such holder of record), whose Common Units and
Subordinated Units were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such forms as JPE and
AMID may reasonably agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Units to the Exchange
Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, AMID shall cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Common Units and Subordinated Units an amount of AMID Units (which shall be in
non-certificated book-entry form) issuable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II. Following the Effective Time, AMID agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient
to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_ , any AMID Units
sufficient to pay any Merger Consideration and any that may be payable from
time to time following the Effective Time. All cash or book-entry units
representing AMID Units deposited with the Exchange Agent or representing AMID
Units to be delivered pursuant to  _Section 2.2(h)_ shall be referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to
be issued or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units and Subordinated Units that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Book-Entry Unit or a properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and a Certificate and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (x) the number of AMID Units representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of AMID Units that such holder has the right to receive in
accordance with the provisions of this _Article II_ and/or (y) a check
denominated in U.S. dollars in the amount of cash, if any, that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. The
Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail after
receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Book-Entry Unit or Certificate and letter
of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid distributions payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate or Book-Entry Unit shall, after the Effective Time, represent for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. The Merger
Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Units shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Common Units or Subordinated Units, as the case may be, formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Units.

(d) _Other Payees_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Unit shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration on the books of JPE of transfers of Common Units.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Units representing Common Units or Subordinated Units outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Common Units or Subordinated Units, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book-Entry Units are presented to the Exchange Agent or AMID, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

 



4 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Common Unitholders or Subordinated Unitholders 12
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to AMID, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Common Units or
Subordinated Units for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Section_ _ _ _2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to AMID for
delivery of the Merger Consideration as applicable, in respect of such
holders Common Units or Subordinated Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
AMID and JPE shall not be liable to any Common Unitholder or Subordinated
Unitholders for any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by Common Unitholders or Subordinated Unitholders
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of AMID free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to AMID Units issued in
the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or
Book-Entry Units until such Certificates or Book-Entry Units are surrendered
as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _2.2_. Following such surrender, subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the record holder of the AMID Units, if any, issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all distributions payable
in respect of any such AMID Units with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the distributions
payable with respect to such AMID Units with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For
purposes of distributions in respect of AMID Units, all AMID Units to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to distributions pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional AMID Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all fractional AMID Units that a holder of Common Units
or Subordinated Units converted pursuant to the Merger would otherwise be
entitled to receive as Merger Consideration (after taking into account all
Certificates or Book-Entry Units delivered by such holder) will be aggregated
and then, if a fractional AMID Unit results from that aggregation, be rounded
up to the nearest whole AMID Unit.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by AMID, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as AMID may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units or Subordinated Units
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. AMID and the Exchange Agent shall deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to a Common Unitholder or Subordinated Unitholder such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding
is required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in AMID Units). To
the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax
authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Common Units
or Subordinated Units, as applicable, in respect of whom such withholding was
made. If withholding is taken in AMID Units, AMID and the Exchange Agent shall
be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal to
the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale
and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

 

(k) _Tax Characterization of the Merger_. JPE and AMID each acknowledges
and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and pursuant to the
Merger (i) each holder of Common Units or Subordinated Units (other than
Common Units or Subordinated Units held by the ArcLight Affiliates or GP Sub)
will be deemed to contribute its Common Units or Subordinated Units to AMID
in exchange for the Public Unit Consideration and the

 



5  deemed assumption of each such JPE Unitholders share of the liabilities of
JPE and (ii) each of the ArcLight Affiliates will be deemed to contribute the
Common Units (other than GP Sub Common Units) or Subordinated Units it holds
to AMID in exchange for the Affiliate Unit Consideration and the deemed
assumption of the ArcLight Affiliates share of the liabilities of JPE. AMID
and JPE each acknowledges and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes such deemed transaction will qualify in part for nonrecognition of
gain or loss pursuant to Section 721 of the Code and will be characterized as
a disguised sale transaction described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code
with respect to any amounts treated as a transfer of consideration pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(a)(1) (the " _Section 707 Consideration_
," which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any amount of liabilities
other than certain "qualified liabilities" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.707-5(a)(6)) deemed to be assumed as part of the Merger)
(such sale, a " _Disguised Sale_ "). Each of JPE and AMID agrees to prepare
and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing
and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return,
or in the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Governmental Authority.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Phantom Units and Equity Plans_. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event
prior to the Effective Time, the JPE GP Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering any JPE Equity Plans) will adopt resolutions, and JPE
will take all other actions as may be necessary or required in accordance
with applicable Law and each JPE Equity Plan (including, the award agreements
in respect of awards granted thereunder) to give effect to this _Section_ _ _
_2.3_ to provide that:

 

(a) _Treatment of Phantom Units_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in the terms of a particular award, each award of Phantom Units that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
cease to relate to or represent a right to receive Common Units and shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive an award of
phantom units relating to AMID Units (a " _Converted AMID Phantom Unit Award_
") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding
award of Phantom Units, except that the number of AMID Units covered by each
such Converted AMID Phantom Unit Award shall be equal to the number of Common
Units subject to the corresponding award of Phantom Units multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio. If a fractional AMID Unit results from such calculation,
the total number of AMID Units covered by the applicable Converted AMID
Phantom Unit Award shall be rounded up to the nearest whole AMID Unit.

 

(b) _Assumption of JPE Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, AMID shall
assume the obligations of JPE under the JPE Equity Plans and shall assume
such plans for purposes of employing such plans to make grants of equity based
awards on AMID Units following the Closing.

 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article
II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section
5.2), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding Common Units, Subordinated Units, or AMID Units shall have been
changed into a different number of units or a different class by reason of
the occurrence or record date of any unit dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution,
combination, exchange of units or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up,
unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction and
to provide the holders of Common Units and Subordinated Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

represent and warrant, jointly and severally, to the AMID Entities as follows:

and has all requisite partnership, corporate, limited liability company or
other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not,

_JPE Material Adverse Effect_ ") .

(b) Each of JPE, JPE GP and their respective Subsidiaries is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location

interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of JPE that are owned directly or indirectly by JPE have

execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, subject to obtaining the JPE

the JPE Entities and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal, valid

creditors rights and remedies generally and by general principles of equity
(whether applied in a Proceeding or at law or in equity).

license, lease, contract or other agreement (including any Material Contract),
instrument or obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") or JPE Permit (including
any Environmental Permit) to which JPE or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,

Section 3.5 _JPE SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) JPE and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since October 1,
2014 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _JPE SEC Documents_ ").
The JPE SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
the JPE SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other JPE SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
applicable to such JPE SEC Documents, and none of the JPE SEC Documents as of
such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with
respect to the JPE SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of JPE, none of the JPE
SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of JPE included in the JPE SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of JPE and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash
flows and changes in partners equity for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to JPE and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

 



9 (c) JPE has established and maintains internal control over
financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are
defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to JPE, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by JPE in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to JPEs principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by JPE in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. JPEs principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to JPEs auditors and the audit committee of the JPE GP Board (x)
all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect JPEs ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for JPEs auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
JPEs internal controls. The principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of JPE have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the JPE SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct
when made. The management of JPE has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of JPEs internal control over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of JPE, as of the date of this Agreement there are
no facts or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance

for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither JPE nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of JPE prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a JPE Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither JPE nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among JPE and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where
the purpose of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, JPE in JPEs published
financial statements or any JPE SEC Documents.

have, individually or in the aggregate, a JPE Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the JPE Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of JPE, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a JPE Material Adverse
Effect. JPE and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2013 have

to the Knowledge of JPE, no event or condition has occurred or exists which
would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or

JPE Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental
Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend any JPE Permit (in each

would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a JPE Material Adverse
Effect.

representations and warranties of AMID set forth in Section 4.9, none of the
information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of JPE

face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such other section

exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would reasonably be

represent and warrant, jointly and severally, to the JPE Entities as follows:

company or other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an AMID
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _AMID SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) AMID and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31,
2012 (collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis
on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _AMID SEC Documents_
"). The AMID SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the
case of the AMID SEC Documents that are registration statements filed
pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective
SEC filing dates (in the case of all other AMID SEC Documents), or, if
amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to
such AMID SEC Documents, and none of the AMID SEC Documents as of such
respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the AMID SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of AMID, none of the AMID SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of AMID included in the AMID SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of AMID and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to AMID and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) AMID has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to AMID, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed by AMID in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to AMIDs principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AMID in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. AMIDs principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
AMIDs auditors and the audit and risk committee of the AMID GP Board (x) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect AMIDs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for AMIDs auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
AMIDs internal controls. The principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of AMID have made all certifications required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the AMID SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of AMID has completed its assessment

 



19  of the effectiveness of AMIDs internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of AMID, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of AMID and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including
the notes thereto) included in the AMID SEC Documents filed by AMID and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither AMID nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of AMID prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither AMID nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among AMID and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where
the purpose of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, AMID in AMIDs published
financial statements or any AMID SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an AMID Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, AMID and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither
AMID nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in _Section_
_ _ _5.2(b)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of JPE, would violate such
provisions.

 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of AMID, threatened) by any
Governmental Authority with respect to AMID or any of its Subsidiaries or
actions, suits or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of AMID,
threatened) against AMID or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties, at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority,
and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority
against AMID or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) AMID and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2013
and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have
been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

(b) AMID and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for AMID and its Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the " _AMID Permits_ "), except where
the failure to have any of the AMID Permits would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect. All AMID Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not have, 

 



20  individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of AMID Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of AMID, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse
Effect. AMID and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2013 have
not been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any AMID Permit,
except where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of AMID, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of AMID or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any AMID Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any AMID Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ _ _ _4.8(a)_ , AMID, each
of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of AMID, each joint venture
partner, joint interest owner, consultant, agent, or representative of any of
the foregoing (in their respective capacities as such), (i) has not violated
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any other U.S. and foreign anti-
corruption Laws that are applicable to AMID or its Subsidiaries; (ii) has not,
to the Knowledge of AMID, been given written notice by any Governmental
Authority of any facts which, if true, would constitute a violation of the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other U.S. or foreign anti-
corruption Laws by any such person; and (iii) to the Knowledge of AMID, is not
being (and has not been) investigated by any Governmental Authority except,
in each case of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.9 _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of JPE set forth in Section 3.9, none of the
information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on behalf of AMID
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the
Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to JPE Unitholders, and
at the time of the JPE Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AMID makes no representation or
warranty with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of JPE for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the foregoing documents.

 

Section 4.10 _Tax Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in material liability to AMID or any of its unitholders or
Subsidiaries (i) all Tax Returns that were required to be filed by or with
respect to AMID or any of its Subsidiaries have been duly and timely filed
(taking into account any extension of time within which to file) and all such

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) JPE and JPE GP shall, and JPE shall cause its Subsidiaries and use
reasonable best efforts to cause JPEs and its Subsidiaries respective
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to a JPE Alternative Proposal, request the return or destruction of all
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of JPE or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit any access by any Person
(other than AMID and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic data
room relating to a possible JPE Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted by
this  _Section_ _ _ _5.3_ , (x) JPE and JPE GP shall not, and JPE shall cause
its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing confidential
information) or knowingly induce or take any other action intended to lead to
any inquiries or any proposals that constitute the submission of a JPE
Alternative Proposal, (ii) grant approval to any Person under _clause_ _ _
_(iii)_ of the provision in the definition of "Outstanding" in the JPE
Partnership Agreement, (iii) except for a confidentiality agreement permitted
pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _5.3(b)_ , enter into any confidentiality
agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, unit
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or unit exchange agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement relating to a JPE Alternative
Proposal or (iv) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to AMID, the JPE Board Recommendation
or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly approve or
adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any JPE Alternative
Proposal and (y) within ten business days of receipt of a written request of
AMID following the receipt by JPE of any JPE Alternative Proposal, JPE shall
publicly reconfirm the JPE Board Recommendation; _provided that_ AMID shall
not be permitted to make such request on more than one occasion in respect of
each JPE Alternative Proposal and each material modification to a
JPE Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking of any action described in
_clause_ _ _ _(x)(iv)_ or the failure to take the action described in _clause
(y_ ) being referred to as an " _JPE Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by JPEs Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ _ _ _5.3_ by JPE unless such
violation is committed without the Knowledge of JPE and JPE uses its
reasonable best efforts to promptly cure such violation once JPE is made aware
of such violation.

 



31 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section_ _ _
_5.3(a)_ , if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the JPE Unitholder Approval, (i) JPE has received a written JPE
Alternative Proposal that the JPE GP Board believes is bona fide, (ii) the
JPE GP Board, after consultation with JPE GPs outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, determines in good faith that such JPE Alternative
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a
JPE Superior Proposal and, after consultation with JPE GPs outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
duties under the JPE Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and (iii) such
JPE Alternative Proposal did not directly result from a material breach of
this _Section_ _ _ _5.3_ , then JPE may, subject to _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_
below, (A) furnish information, including confidential information, with
respect to JPE and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such JPE Alternative
Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such JPE
Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x) JPE will not, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, disclose any
non-public information to such Person unless JPE has, or first enters into, a
confidentiality agreement with such Person with confidentiality provisions
that are not less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the AMID
Confidentiality Agreement are to AMID and (y) JPE will provide to AMID non-
public information about JPE or its Subsidiaries that was not previously
provided or made available to AMID prior to or substantially concurrently
with providing or making available such non-public information to such other
Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of JPE set forth in this
_Section_ _ _ _5.3_ , JPE shall promptly advise AMID, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, JPE in respect of any JPE Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such
notice to AMID, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall
include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on
behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request),
and thereafter shall promptly keep AMID reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and JPE shall promptly provide AMID with copies of any
additional written materials received by JPE or that JPE has delivered to any
third party making a JPE Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the JPE Unitholder Approval, the JPE GP Board may effect a
JPE Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a JPE Alternative Proposal or
a JPE Changed Circumstance if the JPE GP Board, after consultation with JPE
GPs outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its duties under the JPE Partnership
Agreement or applicable Law and:

 

(i) if the JPE GP Board intends to effect such JPE Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a JPE Alternative Proposal:

(A) such JPE Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not
been withdrawn or abandoned;

(B) the JPE GP Board has determined, after consultation with JPE
GPs outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such JPE Alternative
Proposal constitutes a JPE Superior Proposal;

 

(C) JPE has provided prior written notice to AMID in accordance with 
_Section_ _ _ _8.9_ (the " _JPE Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the JPE GP
Boards intention to effect a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change, and such JPE
Superior Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the Person making such
JPE Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such JPE
Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal or offers
(including proposed agreements) received by JPE in connection with such
JPE Alternative Proposal;

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the
JPE Superior Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the third
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the " _JPE Superior_  

 



32   _Proposal Notice Period_ "), JPE shall (1) negotiate with AMID in good
faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would permit the JPE GP Board not to effect a JPE Adverse Recommendation
Change; and (2) keep AMID reasonably informed with respect to the status and
changes in the material terms and conditions of such JPE Alternative Proposal
or other change in circumstances related thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any material revisions to such JPE Alternative Proposal (it being agreed
that any change in the purchase price in such JPE Alternative Proposal shall
be deemed a material revision) shall require delivery of a subsequent JPE
Superior Proposal Notice and a subsequent JPE Superior Proposal Notice Period
in respect of such revised JPE Alternative Proposal, except that such
subsequent JPE Superior Proposal Notice Period shall expire upon the later of
(x) the end of the initial JPE Superior Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59
p.m. Central time on the date that is the second calendar day following the
date of the delivery of such subsequent JPE Superior Proposal Notice; and

 

(E) the JPE GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by AMID and, at the end of the
JPE Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith that
(i) such JPE Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a JPE Superior
Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect and (ii) failure to
effect a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
duties under the JPE Partnership Agreement or applicable Law even if such
revisions were to be given effect; or

 

(ii) if the JPE GP Board intends to effect such JPE Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a JPE Changed Circumstance:

(A) JPE has provided prior written notice to AMID in accordance with 
_Section_ _ _ _8.9_ (the " _JPE Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the JPE GP
Boards intention to effect a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change, and such JPE
Recommendation Change Notice has specified the details of such JPE Changed
Circumstance and the reasons for the JPE Adverse Recommendation Change;

 

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the JPE
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the " _JPE Recommendation
Change Notice Period_ "), JPE shall (i) negotiate with AMID in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the JPE GP Board not to effect a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change; and
(ii) keep AMID reasonably informed of any change in circumstances related
thereto; and

(C) the JPE GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by AMID and, at the end of the
JPE Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith
that the failure to effect a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its duties under the JPE Partnership Agreement or applicable
Law even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent JPE or the JPE GP
Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to a JPE Alternative Proposal if the JPE
GP Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a
violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that any JPE Adverse Recommendation
Change may only be made in accordance with  _Section_ _ _ _5.3(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes JPEs receipt of a JPE
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including

the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable and in any event within 15 business days after the date of
this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the parties
hereto) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this _Section_ _ _ _5.4_
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date); and (ii) JPE and AMID shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or
similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that such
transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the transaction.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by providing the other parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other party) any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Authority and any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other
party to review in advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with
the other party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences. AMID shall
have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy
for obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining such clearances, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that AMID shall consult
in advance with JPE and in good faith take JPEs views into account regarding
the overall strategy. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.6(b)_ , the parties shall
take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.4_ in a manner so as
to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) AMID and JPE (including by causing their respective Subsidiaries) agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any objections that a
Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any

 



34  Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y)
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _clause (d)_ shall not impose any
requirement on AMID or JPE to dispose, transfer, or separate any assets or
operations.

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by AMID and JPE. Thereafter, neither JPE nor AMID
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE or other
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue
or cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement
without prior consultation with the other party); provided, however, that
(a) JPE shall not be required by this Section 5.5 to consult with any other
party with respect to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and
existence of a JPE Alternative Proposal that the JPE GP Board believes is bona
fide and matters related thereto or a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change but
nothing in this clause (a) shall limit any obligation of JPE under Section
5.3(d) to negotiate with AMID in good faith and; provided, further, that each
party and their respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are
consistent with statements made in previous press releases, public disclosures
or public statements made by AMID or JPE in compliance with this Section 5.5.

 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries
properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in
each case, whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. Each party
shall furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule
and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such party from the SEC concerning compliance
with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare the Proxy
Statement). Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 15, 2016, between AMID and
JPE (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _AMID
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party and its Representatives shall hold
information received from the other party pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.6_
in confidence in accordance with the terms of the AMID Confidentiality
Agreement. 

(b) This _Section_ _ _ _5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of
such party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any
contract or Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such
party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined
with respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could
in such partys good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys
position in any pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto;
_provided_ that, in the case of _clause (i)_ , the parties hereto shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information
(including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the
extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of
any such contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements

 



35  pursuant to which appropriately designated Representatives of the other
party shall be provided access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the party being requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify
the other party that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or
its Subsidiaries obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other
party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the
subject matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in
accordance with the first proviso in this  _Section_ _ _ _5.6(b)_ ) and (z)
in the case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties
hereto.

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. JPE shall give prompt
notice to AMID, and AMID shall give prompt notice to JPE, of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to JPE or AMID, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions
to the Closing in Article VI and (iv) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VI; provided that, in the
case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the failure to comply with this Section 5.7
shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in Article VI, or give rise to any right to terminate this
Agreement under Article VII, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or
failure would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section_ _ _ _5.8_ , (i) " _Indemnified Person_ "
shall mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to
the Effective Time, an officer or director of JPE, JPE GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such Person, in their
capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with JPE) serving at the request of or on behalf of
JPE, JPE GP or any of their respective Subsidiaries and together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall
mean any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that JPE, JPE
GP or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would be permitted to indemnify an
Indemnified Person, AMID, AMID GP and the Surviving Entity, jointly and
severally, agree to honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the JPE Charter Documents and comparable
governing instruments of JPE GP and any Subsidiary of JPE or JPE GP
immediately prior to the Effective Time and ensure that the organizational
documents of the Surviving Entity and AMID GP shall, for a period of six
years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors, officers and agents of JPE, JPE GP and their respective
Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the JPE Charter Documents and
comparable governing instruments of JPE GP (it being acknowledged and agreed
that the provisions of the AMID Charter Documents and comparable governing
instruments of JPE GP currently in effect are no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of such Persons
than are presently in the JPE Charter Documents and comparable
governing instruments of JPE GP). Any right of indemnification of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.8(b)_ shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

 



36 (c) The Surviving Entity and AMID GP shall maintain in effect for
six years from the Effective Time JPEs and JPE GPs current directors and
officers liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons (
_provided_ that, with the written consent of JPE GP obtained prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity or AMID GP may substitute therefor
policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Entity or AMID
GP be required to expend pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _5.8(c)_ more than an
amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by JPE or JPE
GP for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity or
AMID GP would be required to expend more than the Maximum Amount, the
Surviving Entity or AMID GP shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
as is available for the Maximum Amount. If JPE or JPE GP in its sole
discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of AMID and AMID GP under
this _Section_ _ _ _5.8(c)_ , JPE or JPE GP may, prior to the Effective Time,
purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or
alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity
as such; _provided_ that the cost of the "tail policy" shall be borne by the
Surviving Entity or AMID GP and in no event shall the cost of such policy
exceed six times the Maximum Amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_ _ _ _5.8_
shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have
under the organizational documents of JPE, JPE GP, the Surviving Entity, AMID,
AMID GP, the DRULPA or the DLLCA. The provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _5.8_
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for a
period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section_ _ _ _5.9_ are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of all such claims. If the Surviving Entity, AMID GP or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to
the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Entity or AMID GP, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations of the Surviving Entity and AMID GP set forth in this
_Section_ _ _ _5.8_.

 

Section 5.9 _Securityholder Litigation_. JPE shall give AMID the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against JPE and/or its officers and directors relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that JPE shall in any event control
such defense and/or settlement (subject to Section 5.2(a)(xiii)) and shall
not be required to provide information if doing so would be reasonably
expected to threaten the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other
applicable legal privilege.

 

Section 5.10 _Structuring Matters_.

 

(a) JPE shall, at the request of AMID, (i) call for prepayment or
redemption, or prepay or redeem, (ii) attempt to renegotiate the terms of,

satisfy and discharge or defease any then-existing indebtedness for borrowed
money of JPE; _provided_ , _however_ , that JPE shall not be obligated to
make or cause to become effective any such action (nor shall JPE be required
to incur any cost or liability in respect thereof) prior to the Effective
Time. AMID shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any action described above, and provide JPE with a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such documents. AMID and JPE shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate
with each other in the preparation of such documents.

(b) To the extent requested by AMID, JPE shall cooperate with AMID with
respect to, and use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate, possible
alternative or supplemental structures for the acquisition of JPE and its
Subsidiaries (including with respect to any financing with respect thereto);
_provided_ that such structures do not impede or delay the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby or change the Merger Consideration or
adversely affect JPE and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, should the Merger
not occur.

 



37 (c) JPE hereby consents to AMIDs use of and reliance on any audited or
unaudited financial statements relating to JPE and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, any entities or businesses acquired by JPE reasonably requested
by AMID to be used in other activities of AMID, including the Registration
Statement and any other filings that AMID desires or is required to make with
the SEC. In addition, JPE will use commercially reasonable efforts, at AMIDs
sole cost and expense, to obtain the consents of any auditor to the inclusion
of the financial statements referenced above in appropriate filings with the
SEC. Prior to the Closing, JPE will provide such assistance (and will cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective personnel and advisors to
provide such assistance) as AMID may reasonably request in order to assist
AMID in connection with any public offerings to be registered under the
Securities Act or private offerings. Such assistance shall include, but not be
limited to, the following: (i) providing such information, and
making available such personnel as AMID may reasonably request; (ii)
participation in, and assistance with, any marketing activities related to
such financing; (iii) participation by senior management of the JPE in, and
their assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and
meetings with rating agencies; (iv) taking such actions as are reasonably
requested by AMID or its financing sources to facilitate the satisfaction of
all conditions precedent to obtaining such financing; and (v) taking such
actions as may be required to permit any cash and marketable securities of the
JPE or AMID to be made available to finance the transactions contemplated
hereby at the Effective Time.

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of

respective party incurring such fees and expenses, except AMID and JPE shall
each bear and pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the

from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is

Effective Time, each of AMID and JPE shall coordinate with the other
regarding the declaration of any distributions in respect of AMID Units or

holders of Common Units, Subordinated Units or Phantom Units shall not
receive, for any quarter, distributions both in respect of Common Units,
Subordinated Units or Phantom Units and also distributions in respect of AMID
Units that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger, but that they
shall receive for any such quarter either: (i) only distributions in respect

similarly situated employees of AMID with respect to wages, salaries and
other benefit plans and arrangements. No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any JPE Employee and this

employment of any JPE Employee, provided that any such termination is effected
in accordance with applicable Law.

parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including any JPE
Employee), other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies under or by reason of any provision of this _Section 5.16_. Nothing

affirmative covenant to file all necessary UCC and Lien terminations within
five business days following the Closing Date, or (ii) such lenders express
authorization for the AMID Entities to have any such documents filed on the
lenders behalf. At AMIDs sole discretion, AMID shall either (a) obtain any
required consents from the lenders to permit AMID to maintain the Existing
Credit Facility at the Effective Time, provided, however, that any

obliterate all JPE Names and Marks from all existing signage and stocks of
signs, letterheads, invoice stock, advertisements and promotional materials,
inventory and other documents and materials.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an AMID Material Adverse
Effect. JPE shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of AMID by an
executive officer of AMID to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the AMID Entities_. The AMID Entities
shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and
JPE shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of AMID by an
executive officer of AMID to such effect.

(c) JPE shall have received an opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to
JPE, dated as of the Closing Date to the effect that for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, except to the extent that the Section 707 Consideration causes
the Merger to be treated as a Disguised Sale, holders of Common Units or
Subordinated Units (other than Common Units or Subordinated Units held by the
ArcLight Affiliates and GP Sub) should not recognize any income or gain as a
result of the Merger with respect to such Common Units or Subordinated
Units held (other than any gain resulting from (i) any actual or constructive
distribution of cash, including as a result of any decrease in partnership
liabilities pursuant to Section 752 of the Code, or (ii) the receipt of any
non-pro rata Merger Consideration); _provided_ that such opinion shall not
extend to any holder who acquired Common Units or Subordinated Units from JPE
in exchange for property other than cash. In rendering such opinion, Latham and
Watkins LLP shall be entitled to receive and rely upon representations,
warranties and covenants of officers of the AMID Entities and JPE Entities and
any of their respective affiliates as to such matters as such counsel may
reasonably request.

 



41 (d) _Existing Credit Facility_. Contemporaneously with or prior to the
Closing, AMID shall (i) have paid or caused to be paid on behalf of JPE, to
such account or accounts as designated by the applicable lender or
administrative agent in the Payoff Letter and in accordance with the terms
thereof, the dollar amount of all indebtedness and any other amounts required
to be paid under the Existing Credit Facility in order to fully pay off the
Existing Credit Facility or (ii) obtained all required consents from the
lenders under the Existing Credit Facility and AMIDs revolving credit
facility to permit AMID to maintain the Existing Credit Facility following the
Closing.

Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of JPE or any of
the AMID Entities may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 6.1, Section 6.2 or Section 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied
if such failure was caused by such partys failure to use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or other breach of or noncompliance with this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of JPE and AMID duly authorized by each
of the JPE GP Board and the AMID GP Board, respectively.

(b) by either of JPE or AMID:

 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before April 30,
2017 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available (x) to a party
if the inability to satisfy such condition was due to the failure of such
party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or (y) to a
party if the other party has filed (and is then pursuing) an action seeking
specific performance as permitted by _Section 8.8_ ;

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iii) if the JPE Unitholders Meeting shall have concluded and the JPE
Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained; or

(c) by AMID:

 

(i) if a JPE Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the JPE Unitholder Approval, if JPE shall be
in Willful Breach of its obligations pursuant to the first three sentences of
_Section 5.1(b)_ or _Section 5.3_ , other than in the case where (x) such
Willful Breach is a result of an isolated action by a Person that is a
Representative of JPE (other than a director or officer of JPE), (y) such
Willful Breach was not caused by, or within the Knowledge of, JPE and (z) JPE
takes appropriate actions to remedy such Willful Breach upon discovery
thereof; provided that AMID shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ if AMID is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement;

 



42 (iii) if JPE shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of JPE set forth in
this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if
it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or ( _b_ ) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured by JPE within 30 days following
receipt of written notice from AMID of such breach or failure; provided that
AMID shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ if AMID is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

(d) by JPE:

 

(i) if AMID shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations
or warranties of AMID set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true),
which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the
Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ or ( _b_ ) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by
AMID within 30 days following receipt of written notice from JPE of such
breach or failure; provided, that JPE shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ if JPE is then in breach
of any of the first three sentences of _Section 5.1(b)_ or _Section 5.3_ or in
material breach of any of its other representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(ii) prior to the receipt of the JPE Unitholder Approval, in order to
enter into (concurrently with such termination) any agreement, understanding
or arrangement providing for a JPE Superior Proposal in accordance with
_Section 5.3_ ; provided, that JPE shall concurrently with such termination
pay to AMID the JPE Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3_.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section_ _ _ _7.1_ , written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of
this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement
shall forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions in _Section_ _
_ _5.11_ , _Section_ _ _ _7.2_ and  _Section_ _ _ _7.3_ and in the last
sentence of _Section_ _ _ _5.6(a)_ , and the provisions in Article VIII, all
of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of any AMID Entity or JPE or their respective
directors, officers and Affiliates, except (a) JPE and/or AMID may have
liability as provided in _Section_ _ _ _7.3_ , and (b) subject to _Section
7.3(c)_ , nothing shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or
damages for any failure to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby when required pursuant to this Agreement or any party from
liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that (A) a JPE Alternative Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the
time of, the date of the JPE Unitholders Meeting (or, if the JPE Unitholders
Meeting shall not have occurred, and such JPE Alternative Proposal shall have
not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _7.1(b)(i)_ [ _Outside Date_ ]), (B) this Agreement is
terminated by JPE or AMID pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _7.1(b)(i)_ [ _Outside
Date_ ] or  _Section_ _ _ _7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed JPE Unitholder Vote_ ], and
(C) JPE enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates,
any JPE Alternative Proposal within 12 months after the date this Agreement
is terminated (whether or not such JPE Alternative Proposal is the same JPE
Alternative Proposal referred to in _clause (A)_ ), then JPE shall pay to AMID
a termination fee equal to $10.0 million, less any AMID Expenses previously
paid by JPE pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ (the " _JPE Termination Fee_ "),
upon the earlier of the public announcement that JPE has entered into such
definitive agreement or the consummation of any such transaction. For purposes
of this  _Section_ _ _ _7.3(a)_ , the term " _JPE Alternative Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section_ _ _ _8.13_ , except
that the references to "25% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "50%
or more."

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by JPE pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _7.1(d)(iii)_ [ _JPE Superior Proposal_ ] or by AMID pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _7.1(c)(i)_ [ _JPE Adverse Recommendation Change_ ] or _Section_ _ _
_7.1(c)(ii)_ [ _JPE Willful Breach_ ] (without limiting AMIDs remedies
described in _Section_ _ _ _8.8_ ), then JPE shall pay to AMID, within two
business days after the date of termination, the JPE Termination Fee.

 



43 (c) Any payment of the JPE Termination Fee shall be made in cash by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by AMID.

(d) In the event that JPE shall fail to pay the JPE Termination Fee
required pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _7.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a
rate equal to the legal rate of interest provided for in Section 2301 of
Title 6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if JPE shall fail to pay the JPE
Termination Fee when due, JPE shall also pay all of AMIDs reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to
collect such fee. The JPE Entities acknowledge that the provisions of this
_Section_ _ _ _7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby and that, without these agreements the AMID Entities would enter into
this Agreement. The parties agree that in the event that JPE pays the JPE
Termination Fee to AMID, no JPE Entity shall have any further liability to any
AMID Entity of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that in no event shall JPE be required to pay the JPE
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event of termination of this Agreement by (i) either party pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed JPE Unitholder Vote_ ] (or a termination by
JPE pursuant to a different provision of _Section 7.1_ at a time when this
Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) [ _Failed JPE
Unitholder Vote_ ]) or (ii) AMID pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ [ _JPE
Willful Breach_ ], then JPE shall promptly, but in no event later than three
business days after receipt of an invoice (with supporting
documentation) therefor from AMID, pay AMIDs designee all of the reasonably
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, hedging counterparties,
experts and consultants) incurred by AMID and its Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _AMID
Expenses_ "); provided, however, that in the event of a termination of this
Agreement by either party pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed JPE
Unitholder Vote_ ] (or a termination by JPE pursuant to a different provision
of _Section 7.1_ at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed JPE Unitholder Vote_ ]), JPE shall pay the
AMID Expenses up to a maximum amount of $5 million. In no event shall JPE have
any obligation to make any such payment if, at the time of such termination,
this Agreement was terminable by JPE pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ [ _AMID
Uncured Breach_ ].

ARTICLE VIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1 _No Survival, Etc_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the representations, warranties and agreements of each party hereto
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of

prior to or after the execution of this Agreement. The representations,
warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective
Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be, except that the
agreements set forth in Article II, Section 5.8, Section 5.11, Section 5.14
and Section 5.19 and any other agreement in this Agreement that contemplates
performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time and
those set forth in Section 5.11, Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, in the last

Section 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the JPE Unitholder Approval by written
agreement of the parties hereto; provided, however, that following approval of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder by the JPE
Unitholders, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions of this
Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the JPE Unitholders
or AMID Unitholders, as applicable, without such approval. Unless otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision,
approval or consent of JPE or the JPE GP Board or of AMID or the AMID GP Board
is required pursuant to this Agreement, such determination, decision,
approval or consent must be authorized by the JPE GP Board and AMID GP Board,
as applicable.

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by any JPE Entity or any AMID Entity in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties except that (a) AMID may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of AMID, but no such assignment shall
relieve AMID of any of its obligations hereunder and (b) JPE may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of JPE, but no such
assignment shall relieve JPE of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section 8.4 shall be null and void.

 

Section 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the GP Merger Agreement, the Support Agreements, the AMID
Partnership Agreement Amendment, the JPE Disclosure Schedule, the AMID
Disclosure Schedule and the AMID Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights (including third-party
beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the
case of clause (b), (i) the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _5.8_ , _Section
5.19(a)_ and _Section_ _ _ _8.12_ and (ii) the right of the JPE Unitholders
to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim by the JPE
Unitholders with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing
shall have occurred) and the right of holders of equity awards to receive the
Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to this Agreement
after the Closing (a claim by such holders with respect to which may not be
made unless and until the Closing shall have occurred).

 

Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section_ _ _
_8.7_ , (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the

 



45  fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (z) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this Section 8.8 in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.8, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The Parties
agree that in the event that AMID receives the JPE Termination Fee, AMID may
not seek any award of specific performance under this Section 8.8.

Section 8.9 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to
any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
