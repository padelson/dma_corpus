action by a Governmental Body in connection with the permitting process for
such Projects or (iv) any Lot which shall be the subject of an
Unresolved Title Objection under _Section 7.7(c)_. In order to reach an
agreement on a Substitute Project, the parties shall engage in the following
process: 

   

 (a) Sellers or Buyer shall notify the other in writing of any Replaced Project for which a Substitute Project is proposed, specifying such Replaced Project or Replaced Projects and the reason for substitution (the " _Request Notice_ "); 

   

 (b) Within thirty (30) days of issuing or receiving the Request Notice, Sellers shall propose to Buyer in writing (the " _Proposed Substitute Project Notice_ ") a Substitute Project in the same market as the Replaced Project, or in a different market if acceptable to Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion. The Substitute Project proposed by Sellers are intended to have a similar Value as the Replaced Project; 

   

 (c) (i) For purposes of this definition, in determining "Value," in the case of a Replaced Project, the parties shall be bound by (1) the value assigned to such Project as set forth on  _Schedule 3.6(B)_, or if no value is assigned to such Project in _Schedule 3.6(B)_, then (2) the discounted net present value of the gross profit (as determined in accordance with the accounting practices utilized by Sellers prior to the Closing Date) projected by the Projections to be realized from the sale of completed homes on the Lots in such Project over the period of time which the Projections forecast would be required to sell completed homes on all of the Lots in such Replaced Project; provided that all net present value calculations to be performed under this procedure shall be calculated at a discount rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, calculated on an annual basis. In calculating the net present value, the parties shall also be bound by the sales prices and gross margin amounts for such Project as shown in the Projections; 

   

 (ii) For purposes of this definition, in determining "Value", in the case of a Substitute Project, the parties shall be bound by the discounted value of the gross profit (as determined in accordance with the accounting practices utilized by Sellers prior to the Closing Date) projected to be realized from the sale of completed homes on the Lots in such Project over a period of time which would reasonably be expected to be required to sell completed homes on all of the Lots in such Substitute Project. The parties shall also be bound by the sales prices and gross margin amounts which Sellers have experienced in building and selling homes similar to the products which Sellers have planned to offer for sale on lots similar in size to the Lots proposed in such Substitute Project; 

  

 (d) If Buyer does not agree that the proposed Substitute Project has the same Value as the Replaced Project (or if Sellers and Buyer cannot agree on the difference in value (the " _Value Disparity_ ")), then Buyer shall so notify Sellers in writing within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the Proposed Substitute Project Notice (the " _Value Disparity Notice_ "). Within seven (7) days of receipt of the Value Disparity Notice, Buyer and Sellers shall each engage an MAI appraiser experienced in the market in which the proposed Replaced Project and Substitute Project are located. The appraisers shall determine the Value of both the Replaced Project and the proposed Substitute Project to determine the Value Disparity, in each case using the methodology described in subparagraph (c) above. If the two appraisers determinations of the Value Disparity between the Replaced Project and the proposed Substitute Project differ by less than five percent (5%), the Value Disparity shall be the average of the two (2) determinations. If the determinations differ by more than five percent (5%), then the two (2) appraisers shall engage a third appraiser, whose determination of the Value Disparity shall be averaged with the other two (2) valuations. Such third appraiser shall also determine the Value of both the Replaced Project and the proposed Substitute Project to determine the Value Disparity, in each case using 

    ##### 

  

    

the methodology described in subparagraph (c) above. Buyer and Sellers
(collectively) shall each be responsible for one-half of the fees and
expenses of such appraisers; 

   

 (e) Upon confirmation of the Value Disparity, if any, Buyer may elect either (i) to accept the Proposed Substitute Project(s) and allow Sellers to propose additional Substitute Projects to compensate for the amount of the Value Disparity, or (ii) to require Sellers to propose new Substitute Projects, whereupon the process described above shall be followed with respect to the new proposed Substitute Projects; 

   

 (f) Once Buyer has made its election as set forth in (e) above, Buyer shall thereafter have a period of forty (40) days in which to perform due diligence investigations of the proposed Substitute Project for which any Value Disparity has been resolved. If Buyer is not satisfied with the proposed Substitute Project in its sole and absolute discretion, then Buyer may elect either (i) to accept the proposed Substitute Project, or (ii) to require Sellers to propose new Substitute Projects, whereupon the process described above shall be followed with respect to the new proposed Substitute Project; 

   

 (g) Once Buyer has elected to proceed with the proposed Substitute Project, then such Project shall be deemed to be " _Project_ " for all purposes hereunder; 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no provision of a Substitute Project shall relieve Sellers of their obligation to offer the Three Thousand (3,000) Lots under the Right of First Offer Agreement as specified on _Schedule 7.6_; and 

   

 (i) In the event that some, but not all, of the Lots in a Project listed on _Schedule 3.6(b)_ shall fail to become Fully Entitled, Sellers shall be entitled to propose to Buyer an Additional Project which contains Lots which are or will be Fully Entitled. Any individual Lots or group of Lots from a Project listed on _Schedule 3.6(b)_ which do not become Fully Entitled by June 30, 2010 may be replaced by Lots in an Additional Project. Upon the acceptance of such replacement Lots, Sellers shall be entitled to receive payment of an Entitlement Payment for such Lot, calculated and payable in the same manner set forth herein. 

   

 " _Tax_ " (and, with correlative meaning, " _Taxes_ ") shall mean: (i) any federal, state, local or foreign net income, gross income, gross receipts, windfall profit, severance, property, production, sales, use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll, withholding, alternative or add-on minimum, ad valorem, value-added, transfer, stamp, or environmental tax (including taxes under Code Section 59A), or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed by any governmental authority; and (ii) any liability of Sellers for the payment of amounts with respect to payments of a type described in clause (i) as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group, or as a result of any obligation of any Seller under any Tax Sharing Arrangement or tax indemnity arrangement.

If Sellers do not so object within Sellers Review Period, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Purchase Price set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report shall be final and binding as the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Purchase Price_ " respectively), for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 

   

 (c) If Sellers so object (and provide the required supporting documentation) within the Sellers Review Period, Buyer and Sellers shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed Adjustments_ ") any differences as to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Worth included in the determination of the Preliminary Purchase Price and, if Sellers and Buyer so resolve any such differences, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Date Net Worth included in the determination of the Preliminary Purchase Price set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report as adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments shall be final and binding as the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) If any objections raised by Sellers are not resolved by Agreed Adjustments within the thirty (30) day period next following the Sellers Review Period, then Buyer and Sellers shall submit the objections that are then unresolved (the " _Unresolved Objections_ ") to BDO Seidman (or to such other accounting firm acceptable to both Seller and Buyer) and such firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") shall be directed by Buyer and Sellers to resolve the Unresolved Objections (based solely on the presentations by Buyer and by Sellers as to whether any Unresolved Objection had been determined in a manner consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles) as promptly as reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice to each of Buyer and Sellers setting forth its resolution of the Unresolved Objections. The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Worth included in the determination of the Preliminary Purchase Price, after giving effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of Unresolved Objections by the Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding as the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Worth included in the determination of Purchase Price, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 

   

 (e) The parties hereto shall make available to Buyer, Sellers and, if applicable, the Accounting Firm, such books, records and other information (including work papers) as any of the 

    ##### 

  

    

foregoing may reasonably request to prepare or review the Preliminary
Accounting Report or any matters submitted to the Accounting Firm. 

   

 (f) If the Accounting Firm determines that the positions of Sellers are correct as to thirty percent (30%) or more in dollar amount of the Unresolved Objections, then Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. In all other cases, Sellers shall pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. 

   

 3.4 _Adjustment_. Promptly (but not later than five (5) Business Days) after the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_ that is final and binding as set forth therein: 

  

 (a) if the Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account of Sellers as Sellers shall designate in writing to Buyer, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Purchase Price over the Estimated Purchase Price and (ii) the Escrow Agent shall release the Holdback Funds to the Seller; or 

   

 (b) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price by an amount equal to or greater than the Holdback Amount (i) Sellers shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account of Buyer as Buyer shall designate in writing to Sellers, an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Purchase Price minus the Holdback Amount over the Purchase Price and (ii) the Escrow Agent shall release the Holdback Funds to Buyer; or 

   

 (c) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price by an amount less than the Holdback Amount, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Holdback Funds (i) to Buyer, an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Purchase Price over the Purchase Price and (ii) to Sellers, the remainder of the Holdback Funds after releasing the amount set forth in clause (i). 

   

 3.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties agree that, for federal income tax purposes, the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets and the covenant not to compete granted pursuant to _Section 8.1_ in accordance with a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "), which shall be prepared by Sellers and reviewed and approved by Buyer in accordance with the formula set forth on _Schedule 3.5_ hereto at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date. The Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Sellers agree to complete and timely file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 in accordance with the Allocation Schedule pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ and to furnish Buyer with a copy of such form prepared in draft form at least forty-five (45) days prior to the filing due date of such form. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall file any return or take a position with any taxing authority that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule. Sellers agree to revise such Form 8594 after all adjustments, if any, have been made to the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 3.4_. 

  

 3.6 _Post-Closing Payments._  

  

 (a) (i) As additional consideration for the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets, Buyer shall pay to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amounts determined pursuant to _Schedule 3.6(A)_. EBITDA received from the home closings in Substitute Projects and Additional Projects shall be included in Buyers EBITDA for purposes of calculating Sellers entitlement to receive the Earn-Out Payments as provided on _Schedule 3.6(A)_. 

   

 (ii) In the event that Technical Olympic, S.A., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Greece shall no longer own or control more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding equity interest in Technical Olympic USA, Inc., or in the event that Tousa Homes LP, a 

   ##### 

  

 

Delaware limited partnership, or its Affiliates, shall no longer be the owner
of or control at least fifty percent (50%) of the membership interests in
TE/TOUSA, LLC (either event shall be a " _Change of Control_ "), then Sellers
shall be entitled to receive and there shall be paid to Sellers within thirty
(30) days of the date that the Change of Control occurs an amount equal to (1)
the sum of the maximum Earn-Out Payments available for all remaining Earn-Out
Periods beginning with the period in which the Change of Control occurs,
multiplied by (2) a fraction (not to exceed 1.00), the numerator of which
shall be the aggregate Actual EBITDA achieved by Buyer for all Earn-
Out Periods preceding the Earn-Out Period in which the Change of Control
occurs, and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate Targeted EBITDA
for such preceding Earn-Out Periods. In no event shall the amount paid by
Buyer as Earn-Out Payments exceed Thirty Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($37,500,000.00). 

   

 (b) (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amounts set forth on _Schedule 3.6(B)_ for each Unentitled Lot listed on such schedule which becomes a Fully Entitled Lot. Each such payment, if any, to be made to Sellers is referred to in this Agreement as an " _Entitlement Payment_." Prior to Closing, Sellers shall cause the engineer which has been responsible for obtaining the land use change, zoning and other governmental approvals and permits for each of the Unentitled Lots to deliver to the parties a certificate (the " _Closing Date Certificate_ "), setting forth each of the permits and approvals which have been obtained for such respective Lots, and each of the permits and approvals which remain to be obtained in order for Buyer to be able to obtain building permits for the construction of homes on such Lots, excluding the approval and recording of plats for such Lots. The delivery by such engineer, or any replacement engineer which Buyer may retain to replace the engineer which delivered the certificate as of the Closing Date, of a second certificate (the " _Entitlement Certificate_ ") certifying that all of the permits and approvals listed on the Closing Date Certificate or a Lot or group of Lots have been obtained shall constitute conclusive proof that such Lot(s) is now Fully Entitled. Similarly, the delivery by Sellers to Buyer of certified copies of all of the permits and approvals listed on the Closing Date Certificate shall also constitute conclusive proof that such Lot(s) is Fully Entitled. Sellers shall keep Buyer reasonably advised of any improvements which are required to obtain such permits and approvals and the anticipated cost of the same. Buyer shall pay to Sellers the Entitlement Payments due with respect to any Lot for which an Entitlement Certificate has been delivered within ten (10) Business Days of the invoice from Sellers. Sellers shall submit an invoice to Buyer no more frequently than once every calendar month for Lots that were not Fully Entitled at Closing, but have become Fully Entitled since Closing. In no event shall the amount paid by Buyer as Entitlement Payments exceed Thirty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($37,500,000.00). 

   

 (ii) At any time prior to or after Closing, Sellers shall have the right to replace any Project listed on _Schedule 3.6(B_) with a Substitute Project. If any Substitute Lot is Fully Entitled at the time of the approval thereof by Buyer, then the Entitlement Payment for such Lot shall be payable with the next monthly payment following the earlier of execution of appropriate transaction documents conveying such Substitute Lot to Buyer or granting to Buyer the right to acquire such Substitute Lot. The amount which Sellers shall be entitled to receive as Entitlement Payments for such Substitute Lot(s) shall be calculated by taking the Value of the Substitute Project (calculated in the same manner set forth in the definition of Substitute Project), and multiplying such Value by .27998, to establish the aggregate amount of Entitlement Payments available to Sellers for such Substitute Project. The amount of the additional Entitlement Payment for each Lot in such Substitute Project shall be calculated by dividing the total amount of Entitlement Payments for the Substitute Project by the number of Fully Entitled Lots in the Substitute Project. In no event shall the amount paid by Buyer as Entitlement Payments exceed Thirty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($37,500,000.00). 

  

 (iii) Sellers shall have the right to propose to Buyer Additional Projects which are not presently part of the Purchased Assets but which are offered to Buyer under the Right of First Offer Agreement. The projects identified on _Schedule 7.6_ as "Independence 185" and 

   ##### 

  

 

"Summerport" shall also be considered Additional Projects. In the event that
Sellers and Buyer agree upon the terms and conditions upon which an
Additional Project will be sold to and purchased by Buyer, then Sellers shall
be entitled to receive Entitlement Payments with respect to such Lots within
the Additional Projects which shall be or become Fully Entitled. The amount
which Sellers shall be entitled to receive as Entitlement Payments for such
additional Lots shall be calculated by taking the Value of the Additional
Project (calculated in the same manner set forth in the definition of
Substitute Project), and multiplying such Value by .27998, to establish the
aggregate amount of Entitlement Payments available to Sellers for such
Additional Project. The amount of the additional Entitlement Payment for each
Lot in such Additional Project shall be calculated by dividing the total
amount of Entitlement Payments for the Additional Project by the number of
Fully Entitled Lots in the Additional Project. Solely for purposes of
estimating, determining and adjusting the Purchase Price, including the
payments in respect thereof, pursuant to  _Sections_ _3.2_ , _3.3_ and _3.4_
, it shall be assumed that all of the Earn-Out Payments and the maximum
amount of the Entitlement Payments have been paid. In no event shall the
amount paid by Buyer as Entitlement Payments exceed Thirty-Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($37,500,000.00). Buyer shall have the right to
direct Sellers to convey or to cause to be conveyed title to such Additional
Project(s) to a separate entity owned by Technical Olympic USA, Inc. or its
Affiliates, if Buyer is unable to purchase such Additional Project. In the
event of such a conveyance, the EBITDA (as defined in _Schedule 3.6(A)_)
realized by such separate entity from the sale of homes in such Additional
Project(s) shall be added to the Actual EBITDA of Buyer for each respective
Earn-Out Period. 

   

 (c) In the event of a Change of Control, one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the payments due under _Section 3.6(b)_ which shall then be unpaid to Sellers shall be earned and shall not be subject to reduction or set-off. Such sums shall be paid to Sellers (i) with respect to the Contract Property, at the time that Buyer acquires title to the Lot for which the Entitlement Payment is due, and (ii) with respect to the Optioned Real Property, at the time that the "Owner" under the respective Option Agreement for the Project which includes such Lot acquires title to the respective Lot for which the Entitlement Payment is due. With respect to Lots which are, at any time after Closing, already owned by Buyer or by an Option Agreement "Owner," the Entitlement Payment will be immediately due and payable at the time that such Change of Control occurs. 

   

 (d) Pursuant to the New Option Agreements and the New Purchase Contract (as set forth on  _Schedule 5.17(I)_), Buyer is responsible for obtaining the governmental approvals and permits remaining to be obtained with respect to the Projects which are the subject to such agreements in order for the Lots within such respective projects to become Fully Entitled (the " _Remaining Approvals_ ") after (i) in the case of New Option Agreements, the date the owner under each such New Option Agreement acquires title to the Real Property which is the subject of such new Option Agreement, and (ii) in the case of New Purchase Contracts, the date on which Buyer acquires title to the Real Property which is the subject of such New Purchase Contract. Buyer shall keep Sellers reasonably informed of the progress of its activities in obtaining such Remaining Approvals and shall provide Sellers with copies of all submissions to, or written communications with, the governmental agencies from which such Remaining Approvals are to be obtained. Sellers shall be entitled to attend meetings with such governmental agencies and shall be given reasonable notice of such meetings. 

   

 3.7 _Proration of Taxes_. 

  

 Real estate and personal property taxes with respect to all of the Real Property and any other Purchased Asset shall be prorated at Closing. Where available, the 2005 Notice of Proposed Property Taxes will be used to estimate the amount of property taxes due and when not available, the 2004 actual tax bill. All such prorations are to be based on the maximum available discount for early payment. Within thirty (30) days after the issuance of the actual 2005 real property and tangible personal property tax bills, the taxes shall be reprorated based on the actual taxes. In the event that the actual taxes 

     ##### 

 

   

are higher than the estimate, Sellers shall promptly pay the difference to
Buyer. In the event that the actual taxes are less than estimated, Buyer
shall promptly pay the difference to Sellers. If Sellers fail to make the
payment due to Buyer, then Buyer, in addition to all other rights which it
may have under law, may offset such obligation as set forth in _Section
11.1(c)(iii)_.

   ##### 

  

 

all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, in accordance with the

record or verify the transfer to and vesting in Buyer, of the right, title
and interest of such Affiliate in and to the Purchased Assets, free and clear

If Buyer elects to obtain bonds in support of existing bonds delivered by Sellers to Governmental Bodies rather than replacement bonds, Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all fees, costs, premiums or other expenses incurred by Sellers in any required renewals or extensions of Sellers existing bonds. In the event that any amounts shall be paid under or against any bond delivered by Sellers to Governmental Bodies resulting from conditions arising or events occurring after the Closing, which sums are not reimbursed under supporting bonds posted by Buyer, then Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any amounts so paid under Sellers bonds, together with any costs incurred by Sellers in connection therewith.

   ##### 

  

  

 (v) any loss or expense in connection with Buyers construction of homes on the Coral Lakes Lots, unless caused by Sellers gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and hold
harmless under clause (i) of this _Section 11.2(a)_ with respect to Losses
and Expenses incurred by Seller Group Members (other than Losses and Expenses
incurred as a result of inaccuracies of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 6.3_ as to which this proviso shall have no effect)
unless the aggregate amount of such Losses and Expenses subject to
indemnification by Buyer exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00),
and once the aggregate Losses exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000.00), Buyer will be liable for such Losses (i.e. from the first

 (b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)_ shall terminate three (3) years after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Seller Group Member under  _Section 11.2(a)_ thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to:

 (iv) the covenant set forth in _Section 13.6_ which shall survive until the expiration of the six-year period referenced therein; and 

  

 (v) any Loss or Expense of which any Seller Group Member has notified Buyer in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.3_ on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this _Section 11.2_, as to which the obligation of Buyer shall continue until the liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this  _Article 11_ and Buyer shall have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance with this _Article 11_. 

  

 11.3 _Notice of Claims_ Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based; Buyer shall further notify Sellers upon proceeding under _Section 11.1(c)(i)_ and thereafter under each of _Sections 11.1(c)(ii_), _11.1(c)(iii_ ),  _11.1(c)(iv_ ), _11.1(c)(v)_ and _11.1(c)(vi_ ); provided that a Claim Notice in respect of any pending or threatened action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought (each such action or suit being a " _Third Person Claim_ ") shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; provided further that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure. 

   ##### 

  

  

 11.4 _Loss Calculation_. In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any insurance recovery in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer). 

  

 11.5 _Third Person Claims._  

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the assertion of a Third Person Claim against it, such Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnitor of the assertion of such Third Person Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party. 

  

 (b) If an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnitor pursuant to this Section of the assertion of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Person Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnitor is also a Person against whom the Third Person Claim is made and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its commitment and financial capacity to defend such Third Person Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third Person Claim), to assume the defense of such Third Person Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party (except to the extent the Indemnified Party has other issues involved in the same dispute or to the extent resolution of the Third Person Claim could affect liability of the Indemnified Party in other periods or in respect of other issues). After notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third Person Claim, and conditioned upon continuing satisfaction of conditions (i) and (ii) of this Section, the Indemnitor shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Person Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third Person Claim. No compromise or settlement of such Third Person Claims may be effected by the Indemnitor without the Indemnified Partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Requirement of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnitor; (C) the settlement could not give rise to any other liability of the Indemnified Party; and (D) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability or be subject to any compromise or restriction with respect to any such compromise or settlement. If notice is given to an Indemnitor of the assertion of any Third Person Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor will be bound by any determination made in such Third Person Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.6_ hereof, each Seller hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a proceeding in respect of a Third Person Claim is brought against any Buyer Group Member for purposes of any claim that any Buyer Group Member may have under this Agreement with respect to such proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on any Seller with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world. 

  

 (d) With respect to any Third Person Claim subject to indemnification under this Section: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third Person Claim and any related suit, claim, proceeding, demand, order, investigation or request or demand for information at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel; and (ii) the parties agree to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third Person Claim. 

   ##### 

  

  

 11.6 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. To the extent any payment under this _Article 11_ can be properly so characterized under applicable Tax law, it shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 11.7 _Failure to Make Certain Payments_. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not paid when due, the amount of such non-payment shall begin to accrue interest on the sixth (6th) day after written demand therefor by the other party at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum for each day thereafter that such payment shall remain unpaid. In the event that any party shall fail to make any payment, including interest thereon as provided herein, within forty-five (45) days of written demand therefor by the other party, such party shall be deemed to be in default of this Agreement, and the entire unpaid balance of the subject payment (or in the case of a failure to pay an installment of the Earn-Out Payments or the Entitlement Payments, as applicable, the entire unpaid balance of the total Earn-Out Payments or the total Entitlement Payments, as applicable, due under this Agreement) shall become immediately due and payable, and such accelerated amount shall also accrue interest at the maximum rate allowed by law;  _provided_ that no payment shall be accelerated hereunder if such payment is being contested in good faith by a party, unless and until a final determination is adjudged against such party by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

  

 11.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. All claims after the completion of the Closing for breaches of any representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement or any breach of covenant or other provision of this Agreement (other than a claim for specific performance or injunctive relief) shall be made exclusively under and in accordance with this _Article 11_.

 (h) by Sellers if any condition in _Article 10_ has not been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition by such date is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Sellers to comply with their obligations under this Agreement), and Sellers have not waived such condition on or before such date; or

 (b) Sellers sole remedy for breach of this Agreement by Buyer before Closing after expiration of the applicable cure period under _Section 12.1_ without cure shall be termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Article 12_ and retention of the Deposit by Sellers as Sellers liquidated damages.

the Deposit to Buyer by Sellers under this _Section 12.3(c)_. In addition to
the foregoing, Buyer shall not be entitled to the receipt of the Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000.00) referred to above if the termination of

President or Division Manager identified by Buyer (other than Neil Eisner,
Jan Ickovic, Daniel Andreacci or Robert Krief) to enter into Employee
Agreements. Except as provided in _Section 12.3(e)_ and _(f)_ , and except

 (e) Sellers shall immediately return the Deposit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer in the event that Buyer terminates this Agreement as a result of a breach by Sellers of one of its covenants contained herein which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, excepting _Section 7.2(a)_. 

  

 (f) In addition to any payments and damages to which Buyer may be entitled pursuant to  _Section 12.3(a)_ in the event that (x) Buyer is prepared to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and Sellers are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations at the Closing and (y) Sellers agree to sell the Business (whether through sale of assets, stock, merger or other business combination) to another Person on or prior to June 30, 2006, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer promptly upon the consummation of such transaction by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount, if any, by which the total consideration received or to be received (assuming the maximum amount of any deferred consideration will be received) by Sellers or its Affiliates (excluding any sums to be paid to Affiliates of Sellers for the purchase of Lots or other developed or undeveloped real property under "land banking" or other option arrangements but including any purchase premium reasonably allocated thereto) as a result of such transaction, including (i) with respect to any covenant not to compete, employment agreements or similar arrangements, (ii) the amount of any indebtedness for borrowed money or similar liabilities discharged or assumed by such Person and (iii) the maximum amount of any contingent or deferred consideration payable by such Person, exceeds the Purchase Price, calculated as if the Closing had occurred as of the Balance Sheet Date.

The foregoing negotiations shall be based on the terms set forth in _Schedule 12.4_. 

  

 (i) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement within the Negotiation Period, Buyer shall have the right to extend the Closing Date to August 31, 2005 (the " _First Extension Period_ ") in order to find a suitable replacement equity partner; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) If TOUSA Homes LP and Falcone/Ritchie LLC reach an agreement within the First Extension Period, but Falcone/Ritchie LLC fails to convey the Contributed Assets to TE/TOUSA, LLC at or prior to Closing, Buyer may extend the Closing Date to September 30, 2005 day period (the " _Final Extension Period_ "); and 

  

 (iii) If, after the First Extension Period or the Final Extension Period, as the case may be, Buyer is unable to find a suitable equity partner in TE/TOUSA LLC after diligent search, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and Sellers shall return the Deposit paid hereunder.

 13.5 _Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Beneficiaries._  

  

 (a) The rights of a party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such party hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of the other, except that the rights of Buyer hereunder (including, without limitation, the rights to acquire certain Real Property pursuant to the Option Documents) may be assigned prior to the Closing, without the consent of Sellers to one or more of its Affiliates, _provided_ that (i) the assignee shall assume in writing all of Buyers obligations to Sellers hereunder, (ii) Buyer shall not be released from any of its obligations hereunder by reason of such assignment and (iii) Sellers obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to the delivery by such 

   ##### 

  

  

assignee, on or prior to the Closing Date, of a certificate signed on its
behalf containing representations and warranties similar to those made
by Buyer in _Article 6_.

   

 (b) Following the Closing, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements executed in connection herewith may not be assigned by either party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent may be withheld for any reason whatsoever in the sole and absolute discretion of the non-assigning party; provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements to any of its Affiliates. Such assignment or transfer shall not relieve the assignor of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 (c) The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to waive any rights, defenses or remedies available under this Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules at law or in equity or to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. 

  

 13.6 _Access to Records after Closing_. 

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, each Seller and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records of Sellers transferred to Buyer hereunder to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by such Seller in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of Sellers prior to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Sellers shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by them pursuant to this _Section 13.6_. If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Sellers may select. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records relating to the Purchased Assets and the Contributed Assets, Sellers or the Business which Sellers or any of their Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Sellers and their Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 13.6_. If Sellers or any of its Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Sellers shall, prior to such disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may select. 

  

 (c) Buyer shall provide Sellers with reasonable access to any Hired Employee to permit Sellers to review and resolve any disputes relating to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and to assist in preparing or resolving any audit of Sellers tax returns for the years ended on or prior to December 31, 2005. 

  

 13.7 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior agreements or understandings between or among any of the parties hereto, including the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.8 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable. 

  

 13.9 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

  

 13.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided for herein, each party hereto shall pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and accountants. All costs and expenses, if any, incurred by Sellers in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and accountants to Sellers shall be paid by Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall pay at the Closing any transfer Taxes, documentary stamps and title insurance premiums; provided that the parties agree to cooperate to minimize costs related to title insurance and transfer Taxes arising therefrom. 

  

 13.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Sellers and Buyer. Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile shall be deemed to be original signatures for all purposes. 

  

 13.12 _Enforcement of Agreement_. In the event of an action at law or in equity between the parties hereto to enforce any of the provisions hereof, the non-prevailing party to such litigation or Proceeding shall pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred therein by such prevailing party on trial and appeal as adjudged by the court, and if such prevailing party or parties shall recover judgment in any such action or Proceeding, such costs, expenses and attorneys fees may be included as part of such judgment. In the event that a party prevails on some but not all of the issues, the costs and expenses shall be apportioned based on the value of the issues on which it prevailed as compared to the issues on which it did not prevail. 

  

 13.13 _Further Assurances; Power of Attorney_. From time to time following the Closing, Sellers shall, with reimbursement from Buyer for all reasonable costs incurred, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to more effectively convey and transfer to Buyer the Purchased Assets and the Contributed Assets, and, in the case of any licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations, agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other commitments (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of third parties which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing, to cooperate with Buyer at its request in endeavoring to obtain such consent promptly, and if any such consent is unobtainable, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure to Buyer the benefits thereof in a manner mutually agreeable to both parties, or (b) which are 

   ##### 

  

  

otherwise not transferable or assignable, to use its commercially reasonable
efforts jointly with Buyer to secure to Buyer the benefits thereof in a
manner mutually agreeable to both parties (including the exercise of
the rights of Sellers thereunder); provided, however that nothing herein
shall relieve Sellers of their obligations under _Section 7.3_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any license, certificate,
approval, authorization, agreement, contract, lease, easement or other
commitment if an attempted assignment thereof without the consent of a third
party thereto would constitute a breach thereof.

   

 Each Seller hereby constitutes and appoints Buyer, with full power of substitution, as such partys true and lawful attorney in fact, authorizing Buyer to open mail addressed to such party, to endorse checks and other instruments payable to such Seller, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and file such deeds, transfers, conveyances, assignments, instruments, certificates and documents and to take such other actions in the name, place and stead of such Seller as Buyer may find necessary or appropriate to effectuate or carry out the intent of any provision of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ said power of attorney shall not authorize Buyer to pay, perform or discharge any liabilities of any Seller not included within the Assumed Liabilities or to receive any monies or other things of value associated with or resulting from the Excluded Assets. Not later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the end of each calendar month for the twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Sellers copies of (x) all mail addressed to Sellers which was opened by Buyer and any correspondence or other documents evidencing action taken by Buyer with respect thereto and (y) all deeds, transfers, conveyances, assignments, instruments, certificates and documents which were executed, acknowledged or delivered by Buyer under the foregoing appointment, including all checks payable to any Seller which may have been endorsed or negotiated by Buyer. 

  

 13.14 _Sellers  Representative_. Sellers hereby appoint Arthur J. Falcone as their agent and attorney-in-fact to give and receive notices and communications on behalf of Sellers; to perform the covenants and future acts required or permitted under this Agreement or the Exhibits and Schedules hereto; to negotiate, consent, settle, compromise or waive Buyers obligations under this Agreement; or to comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims; and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Arthur J. Falcone for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Arthur J. Falcone hereby consents to such appointment (the " _Sellers  Representative_"). 

  

 13.15 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties to this Agreement consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of the State of Florida, County of Broward. Under no circumstances will any Seller assert any claim or cause of action in any state or federal court outside of the State of Florida. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOT EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. 

  

 13.16 _Time is of the Essence_. With respect to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.17 _Radon Gas_. In accordance with the requirements of Florida Statutes Section 404.056(5), the following notice is hereby given: 

  

"RADON GAS: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that, when it has
accumulated in a building in sufficient quantities, may present health risks
to persons who are exposed to it over time. Levels of radon that exceed
federal and state guidelines have been found in buildings in Florida.
Additional information regarding radon testing may be obtained from your
county public health unit."

   

 13.18 _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing and interpreting this Agreement. 

  

 13.19 _Legal Representation of the Parties_. This Agreement was negotiated by the parties with the benefit of legal representation, and any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or interpreted against any party shall not apply to any construction or interpretation hereof. 

  

 13.20 _Disclosure_ IF THE DISCLOSURE SUMMARY REQUIRED BY SECTION 720.401, FLORIDA STATUTES, HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER BEFORE EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT FOR SALE, THIS AGREEMENT IS VOIDABLE BY BUYER BY DELIVERING TO SELLERS OR SELLERS AGENT OR REPRESENTATIVE WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE BUYERS INTENTION TO CANCEL WITHIN 3 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THE DISCLOSURE SUMMARY OR PRIOR TO CLOSING, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST.
