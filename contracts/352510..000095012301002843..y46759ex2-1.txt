subsidiary of Parent or a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer Bank;  
WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Buyer Bank and the Company have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their stockholders to consummate the business combination transaction
provided for herein and in the plan of merger, as set forth on Exhibit A (the
"Plan of Merger"), in which New Bank will, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein and therein, merge (the "Merger") with and
into the Company;   WHEREAS, after the Effective Time (as defined below),
it is anticipated that Parent will cause the Company, as the surviving bank
of the Merger, to be merged with and into Buyer Bank; and   WHEREAS, the
parties hereto desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   1

601, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), New Bank shall
merge with and into the Company. The Company shall be the surviving bank
(hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Bank") in the Merger, and shall
continue its existence under the laws of the State of New York. The name of
the Surviving Bank shall continue to be Commercial Bank of New York." Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of New Bank shall
terminate.  2.2 Effective Time Subject to the provisions of this Agreement
and the Plan of Merger, the Merger shall become effective at the date and
time set forth in the certificate which shall be issued by the Superintendent
of Banks of the New York Banking Department (the "Superintendent") pursuant
to Section 601-b of the N.Y.B.L. The "Effective Time" shall be the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective, as specified in the certificate of
the Superintendent.  (a) Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, (i)
the separate existence of New Bank shall cease, and New Bank\'s organization
certificate shall be deemed cancelled, (ii) the organization certificate of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
organization certificate of the Surviving Bank until duly amended in
accordance with applicable law, (iii) the bylaws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Bank until duly amended in accordance with applicable law, (iv) the main
office and branch offices of the Company, established and authorized
immediately prior to the Effective Time and listed on Exhibit B hereto, shall
become established and authorized branch offices of the Surviving Bank and
(v) the directors and officers of New Bank immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Bank, each to hold
office in accordance with the organization certificate and bylaws of the
Surviving Bank until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.  (b) At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have all the effects set forth in N.Y.B.L. Section 602 and, in
connection therewith, all assets of New Bank as they exist at the Effective
Time shall pass to and vest in the Surviving Bank without any conveyance or
other transfer. The Surviving Bank shall be responsible for all liabilities
and obligations of every kind and description of each of the Company and New
Bank existing as of the Effective Time, whether matured or unmatured,
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not  8 reflected
or reserved against on balance sheets, books of account or records of the
Company or New Bank.   3 ARTICLE  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL
STOCK  OF THE CONSTITUENT BANKS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  4.1 Effect on
Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Buyer Bank, New Bank, the Company or the
holders of any shares of the common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock"):  (a) Conversion of Company Common
Stock.   (i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than 
shares of Company Common Stock (A) owned by the Company or any  Subsidiary
(as defined below) of the Company, or Parent, Buyer Bank,  New Bank or any
other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (except  for Trust Account
Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in  Section 2.1(c)) or (B)
held by stockholders ("Dissenting Stockholders")  duly exercising appraisal
rights, if any, pursuant to Section 604 of  the N.Y.B.L. ("Dissenting Shares"
and, collectively with the shares of  Company Common Stock owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or  Parent, Buyer Bank, New Bank or any
other direct or indirect Subsidiary  of Parent (except for Trust Account
Shares and DPC Shares), the  "Excluded Shares") shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any  action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right  to receive, without interest, $ 32.00 in cash (the
"Merger  Consideration"). As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary"
when  used with respect to any party means any corporation, partnership or 
other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is 
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes.   (ii) As of
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall  no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and  retired and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate previously  representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent the right to  receive the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of such certificates in  accordance with Section 2.2 or the right,
if any, to require the  Surviving Bank to purchase such shares of Company
Common Stock for  their  9  "fair value" as determined in accordance with
Section 604 of the  N.Y.B.L. The holders of such certificates previously
evidencing such  shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the  Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such 
shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time except as  otherwise
provided herein or by law.  (b) Common Stock of New Bank. Each share of
common stock of New Bank issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Bank.  (c) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or by any
Subsidiary of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock that is
owned by Parent, Buyer Bank, New Bank or any other direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Company Common Stock (x) held directly or indirectly in trust
accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of third parties (such shares, whether held directly
or indirectly by Parent or the Company, being referred to herein as "Trust
Account Shares" and (y) held by Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted
("DPC Shares")) shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be
delivered with respect thereto.  4.2 Exchange of Certificates  (a)
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent (as defined
below) shall mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) (i) a
letter of transmittal (the "Company Letter of Transmittal") (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company certificates representing shares of the Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent shall reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby.  (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the party specified by Parent as the exchange agent (the 
10 "Exchange Agent") amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide all
funds necessary for the Exchange Agent to make payments pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i) hereof to holders of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time who are entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration.  (c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Certificates, together with the Company Letter of Transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and only upon such
surrender, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in
exchange therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall promptly cause to be
delivered to such holder, a check in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration payable for each such share of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificate, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings or
transfer taxes or other similar taxes. The Certificates surrendered pursuant
to this Section 2.2(c) shall forthwith be cancelled. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, then upon receipt of an
affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Certificate to be lost,
mislaid, stolen or destroyed and a lost certificate indemnity (in each case
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent), the Exchange Agent
shall issue to such holder the Merger Consideration into which the shares
represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate shall have
been converted.  (d) No interest will be paid or will accrue on the amount
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, as
determined by the Exchange Agent, and that the person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable. One hundred eighty (180) days following the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to it
or any Subsidiary thereof any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent which have not been
disbursed to holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on the Effective Time, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent only as general creditors thereof with
respect to cash payable upon due surrender of their Certificates.  (e) The
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be  11 deemed to have
been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registrations of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.  (f) Stock
Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") issued pursuant to the
Commercial Bank of New York Stock Option Plan (the "Company Stock
Option Plan"), whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled and each holder
of a Company Stock Option who immediately prior to the Effective Time is
employed by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or B-D Sub (as
hereinafter defined) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash
in an amount equal to the product of (a) the amount by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, less any applicable withholding taxes.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Bank to, make such cash payments
to holders of Company Stock Options promptly following the Effective
Time.  (g) The Company shall take all actions that are necessary and
appropriate with respect to the Company Stock Option Plan in order to
implement the provisions of Section 2.3(a), and the Company shall ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Stock Option or any
participant in the Company Stock Option Plan shall have any rights thereunder
to acquire any capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Bank.  4.3 No Liability No Liability. None of Parent, Buyer Bank, New Bank,
the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.  4.4 Dissenters\' Rights Dissenters\' Rights. If
any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to require the Company to
purchase such stockholder\'s shares for their "fair value," as provided in
Section 604 of the N.Y.B.L., the Company shall give Parent notice thereof and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. Neither the Company nor the
Surviving Bank shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall  12 fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
shares held by such stockholder shall thereupon be entitled to be surrendered
in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided by Sections 2.1 and 2.2
hereof.   5 ARTICLE  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES; STANDARDS  FOR REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES  6.1 Disclosure Schedules . Prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent a schedule
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other things, items
the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more of the Company\'s representations or warranties
contained in Article IV, or to one or more of the Company\'s covenants
contained in Articles VI or VII; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (a) no such item is required to
be set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty (other than a representation or warranty contained

4.12, 4.15(a) and 4.20) if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the
standard established by Section 3.2, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in
the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined herein) with respect to the Company.  (a) Standards. No
representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article IV (other than

4.3(b)(i), 4.6, 4.7, 4.8(a)(ii), 4.8(b), 4.11(a), 4.12, 4.15(a) and 4.20) or
of Parent contained in Article V (other than the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.2(c) and 5.4) shall be
deemed untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and no party
hereto shall be deemed to have breached any such representation or warranty
for any purpose under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the
existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or when taken together with all
other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any representations or
warranties contained in Article IV, in the case of the Company, or Article V,
in the case of Parent, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or Parent, respectively.  13 (b)

respect to the Company, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, asset
and liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of the Company

size of the business, assets and liabilities, earnings or scale of
the business relating to International Customers that does not materially
adversely affect the business, assets and liabilities, results of operations
or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries (but excluding the
business relating to International Customers) taken as a whole, or (y) any
such effect attributable to or resulting from (I) any change in banking or
similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or
interpretations thereof by courts or governmental authorities, (II) any
change in GAAP (as defined herein) or regulatory accounting principles, in
each case which affects banks or their holding companies generally, except to
the extent any such condition or change affects the Company to a materially
greater extent than banks or their holding companies generally, or (III) any
change in interest rates, provided, that any such change in interest rates
shall not affect the Company to a materially greater extent than banks or
their holding companies generally, and provided further, that any such change
shall not have a materially adverse effect on the credit quality of the
Company\'s assets, or (ii) the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (Y) with respect to
Parent, a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   7
ARTICLE  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Subject to Article
III hereof and except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:  (a) Corporate

of the State of New York. The Company has the corporate power and authority
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets

previously been made available to Parent, are true and correct copies of 
14 such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
deposit accounts of the Company are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance

laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries has the corporate power and authority to own or lease

being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

makes such licensing or qualification necessary. The articles of
incorporation, by-laws and similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of
the Company, copies of which have previously been made available to Buyer,

this Agreement.  (c) The minute books of the Company and each of its

stock of the Company consists of 12,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock
and 12,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
"Company Preferred Stock"). As of the date of this Agreement, there are (x)
5,299,593 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding and no shares of Company
Common Stock held in the Company\'s treasury, (y) no shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options or
otherwise except for 369,870 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to the Company Option Plan and described in Section 4.2(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (z) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock issued or outstanding, held in the Company\'s treasury or reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly

preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. Except as referred to above or reflected in Section 4.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have and is not bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments
or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
shares of Company   15 Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any
other equity security of the Company or any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Company Common Stock or any
other equity security of the Company. The names of the optionees, the date of
each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted, the number of shares
subject to each such option, the expiration date of each such option, and the
price at which each such option may be exercised under the Company Option
Plan are set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.  (e) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true and correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Except as
set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
capital stock of each of such Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and all of such
shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. Except as contemplated by Section 7.1, no
Subsidiary of the Company has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary. Assuming compliance by Parent with
Section 2.3 hereof, at the Effective Time, there will not be any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be
bound calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of the capital stock
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  (f) Authority; No Violation.

this Agreement and the Plan of Merger (this Agreement and the Plan of Merger,
collectively, the "Merger Documents") and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of each of the
Merger Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of
the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company has directed that the
Merger Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby be
submitted to the Company\'s stockholders for approval at a meeting of such
stockholders and, except for the approval and adoption of the
Merger Documents by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of
the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, no other corporate
proceedings on the part  16 of the Company are necessary to approve the
Merger Documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Each of the Merger Documents has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company, and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent, Buyer Bank and New Bank, as applicable) each of the
Merger Documents will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective
terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity
whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors\' rights and remedies
generally.  (g) Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of the Merger
Documents by the Company, nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by the Company
with any of the terms or provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the organization certificate or by-laws of the Company or the
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar governing documents of any
of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals
referred to in Section 4.4 hereof are duly obtained, (x) violate any statute,
code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of

Relating to the Conduct of Business. During the period from the date of this
Agreement and continuing until the Effective Time, except as expressly
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or with the prior written consent
of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall carry on their respective
businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and
consistent with prudent banking practice. Except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to (x) preserve
its business organization and that of its Subsidiaries intact, (y) keep
available to itself and Parent the present services of the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (z) preserve for itself and Parent
the goodwill of the customers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and others
with whom business relationships exist. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and except as set forth in Section 6.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise  33 contemplated by this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Parent, the Company shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to:  (a) solely in the case of the Company,
declare or pay any dividends on, or make other distributions in respect of,
any shares of its capital stock, other than normal quarterly dividends not in
excess of $.085 per share of Company Common Stock;  (i) split, combine or
reclassify any shares of its capital stock or issue or authorize or propose
the issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
substitution for shares of its capital stock, (ii) repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire (except for the acquisition of Trust Account Shares and
DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section 2.1(c) hereof) any shares of
the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any
securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of the capital
stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; or (iii) issue,
deliver or sell, or authorize or propose the issuance, delivery or sale of,
any shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible into or
exercisable for, or any rights, warrants or options to acquire, any such
shares, or enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing,
except, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), for the issuance of Company
Common Stock upon the exercise or fulfillment of rights or options issued or
existing pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements, all to
the extent outstanding and in existence on the date of this Agreement and in
accordance with their present terms;  (b) amend its organization
certificate, by-laws or other similar governing documents;  (c) authorize
any of its officers, directors, or agents to directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiries relating to, or the making of any
proposal which constitutes, a "takeover proposal" (as defined below), or
recommend or endorse any takeover proposal, or participate in any discussions
or negotiations, or provide third parties with any nonpublic information,
relating to any such inquiry or proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort
or attempt to make or implement a takeover proposal; provided, however, that
the Company may communicate information about any such takeover proposal to
its stockholders if, in the judgment of the Company\'s Board of Directors,
based upon the advice of outside counsel, such communication is required
under applicable law; provided further, however, that nothing contained in
this Section 6.1(d) shall prohibit the Company from furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person
or entity that makes an unsolicited, bona fide takeover proposal that 
34 constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) in each case if, and
only to the extent that (A) such actions occur at a time prior to approval of
the Merger Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders, (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with and
based upon the advice of outside counsel, that it is required to do so in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable law, and (C) prior to taking such action, the Company
receives from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement and
an executed standstill agreement, each in reasonably customary form (provided
that such agreements shall contain terms that are no less restrictive than
the terms of any such agreement between Buyer and the Company). For purposes
of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written takeover
proposal for or in respect of all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, (i) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the takeover proposal deemed relevant by such Board of
Directors, including the consideration to be paid pursuant thereto,
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
consummation, and the ability of the party making such proposal to obtain
financing therefor) are more favorable from a financial point of view to its
stockholders than the Merger, and (ii) that constitutes a transaction that,
in such Board of Directors\' good faith judgment, is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms set forth, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal. The Company will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations previously conducted with any parties other than Parent with
respect to any of the foregoing. The Company will take all actions necessary
or advisable to inform the appropriate individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.1(d). The Company will notify Parent immediately if any such inquiries or
takeover proposals are received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company, and the Company will promptly inform Parent in
writing of all of the relevant details with respect to the foregoing. As used
in this Agreement, "takeover proposal" shall mean any tender or exchange
offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner a substantial equity interest in, or a
substantial portion of the assets of, the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company other than the transactions contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement;  35 (d) make any capital expenditures other than those which (i)
are made in the ordinary course of business or are necessary to maintain
existing assets in good repair and (ii) in any event are in an amount of no
more than $500,000 in the aggregate;  (e) enter into any new line of
business;  (f) acquire or agree to acquire, by merging or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial equity interest in or a substantial
portion of the assets of, or by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof or otherwise acquire any assets, which would be material,
individually or in the aggregate, to the Company, other than in connection
with foreclosures, settlements in lieu of foreclosure or troubled loan or
debt restructurings in the ordinary course of business consistent with
prudent banking practices;  (g) take any action that is intended or may
reasonably be expected to result in any of its representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respect,
or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII not being
satisfied;  (h) change its methods of accounting in effect at December 31,
2000 except as required by changes in GAAP or regulatory accounting
principles as concurred to by the Company\'s independent auditors;  (i)
except as required by applicable law or as required to maintain qualification
pursuant to the Code, and other than in connection with the formation of B-D
Sub, the transfer of Company Employees to B-D Sub as permitted by this
Agreement and the approval of compensation and employee benefit plans and
third-party administrative agreements by B-D Sub, adopt, amend, renew
or terminate any employee benefit plan (including, without limitation, any
Plan) or any agreement, arrangement, plan or policy between the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company and one or more of its current or former
directors, officers or employees or (ii) except for normal increases in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or except as
required by applicable law, increase in any manner the compensation or fringe
benefits of any director, officer or employee or pay any benefit not required
by any Plan or agreement as in effect as of the date hereof (including,
without limitation, the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units or shares); 
36 (i) other than activities in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, sell, lease, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
agree to sell, lease, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, any of its
material assets, properties or other rights or agreements;  (j) other than
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, incur any
indebtedness for borrowed money or assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise as
an accommodation become responsible for the obligations of any other
individual, corporation or other entity;  (k) file any application to
relocate or terminate the operations of any banking office of it or any of
its Subsidiaries;  (l) make any equity investment or commitment to make such
an investment in real estate or in any real estate development project, other
than in connection with foreclosures, settlements in lieu of foreclosure or
troubled loan or debt restructurings in the ordinary course of business
consistent with prudent banking practices;  (m) create, renew, amend or
terminate or give notice of a proposed renewal, amendment or termination of,
any material contract, agreement or lease for goods, services or office space
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the

or permit any lease for office space to expire without giving reasonable
prior notice to Parent;  (n) other than in prior consultation with Parent,
restructure or materially change its investment securities portfolio, through
purchases, sales or otherwise, or the manner in which the portfolio is
classified or reported; or  (o) agree to do any of the foregoing.  12.2
Covenants of Parent and Buyer Bank Relating to the Conduct of
Business. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the Effective Time, except as expressly contemplated or permitted by
this Agreement or with the prior written consent of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Parent and Buyer Bank shall carry on their respective
businesses in the ordinary course consistent with prudent banking practice.
Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or consented to in writing
by the Company, Parent and Buyer Bank shall  37 not, and shall not permit

warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
material respect, or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VIII not being satisfied.   13 ARTICLE  ADDITIONAL

each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental

prejudice the rights of the Company\'s customers, jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,

this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.  (i) All information furnished by the Company to
the Parent or its representatives pursuant hereto shall be treated as the
sole property of the Company and, if the Merger shall not occur, the Parent

containing, reflecting or referring to, or derived from, such information.
The Parent shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause its representatives
to, keep confidential all such information, and shall not directly or
indirectly use such information for any competitive or other commercial
purpose. The obligation to keep such information confidential shall continue
for ten years from the date the proposed Merger is abandoned and shall not
apply to (i) any information which (x) was already in the
Parent\'s possession prior to the disclosure thereof by the Company; (y) was
then generally known to the public; or (z) was disclosed to the Parent by a
third party not bound by an obligation of confidentiality or (ii) disclosures
made as required by law. It is further agreed that, if in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder the Parent is
nonetheless, in the opinion of its counsel, compelled to disclose information
concerning the Company to any tribunal or governmental body or agency or else
stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Parent may
disclose such information to such tribunal or governmental body or agency
without liability hereunder.  (j) No investigation by the Parent or its
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company set forth herein.  40 14.2 Stockholder Meeting.
The Company shall take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as is
reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the
Merger Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The Company will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to
its stockholders approval of the Merger Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and such other matters as may be submitted to
its stockholders in connection with the Merger Documents (collectively, the
"CBNY Shareholder Matters"). The Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval or recommendation by the Company of the CBNY Shareholders Matters,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
takeover proposal or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an

Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that in light of a Superior Proposal it is necessary to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under
applicable law, and provided the Company is not in breach of, and has not
breached, any of the provisions of Section 6.1(d), the Company may terminate
this Agreement solely in order to concurrently enter into an Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but only after the third day
following Parent\'s receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board
of Directors of the Company is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, and
only if, during such three-day period, if Parent so elects, the Company and
its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted
terms.  14.3 Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of Parent, Buyer Bank and the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or

cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order
or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other
third party which is required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or Buyer
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Documents, and to  
41 comply with the terms and conditions of such consent, authorization, order
or approval.  (a) Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements. Effective as
of the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Company Employees") shall be eligible to participate in Parent\'s or Buyer
Bank\'s employee benefit plans (including severance plans) in which similarly
situated employees of Buyer Bank participate, to the same extent as
similarly-situated employees of Buyer Bank (it being understood that
inclusion of Company Employees in such employee benefit plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans); provided, however, that
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Bank to, continue the comparable
plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the exclusive benefit of
Company Employees without adverse amendment thereto until such time as
Company Employees become eligible to participate in plans of Parent or Buyer
Bank.  (b) With respect to each Parent or Buyer Bank plan that covers the
Company Employees, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and
vacation entitlement (but not for defined benefit pension accrual), service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or credited by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) shall be treated as service with Buyer Bank. Such service also
shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitations. Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a
comparable benefit plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent or Buyer
Bank plan.  (c) Parent shall honor and shall cause the Surviving Bank to
honor, in accordance with their terms, all employment, severance and other
compensation agreements and arrangements existing prior to the execution of
this Agreement which are between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any director, officer or employee thereof and which have been disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule.  (d) The Company shall be permitted to,
and shall permit its Subsidiaries to, pay bonuses in accordance with their
respective past practices for services through December 31, 2000, and the
compensation with respect to which bonuses are paid for any individual shall
be for the period of time that has elapsed since the payment of the last
bonus. In addition, at the Effective Time each  42 Company Employee shall be
entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 2001 equal to the bonus received by
such Company Employee for the period ended as of December 31, 2000,
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days
from December 31 through the date on which the Effective Time occurs and the
denominator of which is 365.  (e) The Company shall take all actions that
are necessary and appropriate to cause the employer matching contributions
that have been credited to the Company Employees\' employer matching accounts
under the Company\'s 401(k) Profit-Sharing Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be fully vested, effective as of the Effective Time.  (f)
The Company shall be permitted to pay reasonable retention bonuses to Company
Employees after prior consultation with Parent.  (g) Indemnification. In the
event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in
which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is
or was a director or officer of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the
Company or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted
or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree
to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the extent permitted by law,
each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Parent; provided, however, that (1) Parent shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified   43 Party and upon such assumption Parent
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and
the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent, and Parent
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties, (2) Parent shall in all cases be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel with respect to any
claim, action or suit for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (4) Parent shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under
this Section 7.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, provided that the
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under this
Section 7.7 except to the extent such failure to notify prejudices Parent.
Parent\'s obligations under this Section 7.7 shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim (a
"Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Claim.  (h) Parent shall cause the persons serving as
officers and directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time by the
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by the
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not
less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers
and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event
shall Parent be required to expend on an annual basis more than 175% of the
current amount expended by the Company (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain
or procure insurance coverage, and further provided that if Parent is unable
to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.7(b) Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available for the Insurance Amount.  44 (i) In the event Parent or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in
this section.  (j) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his
or her heirs and representatives.  14.4 Additional Agreements. In case at
any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Bank with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.  14.5 Advice of Changes. Parent and the Company shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having a Material
Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the
Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each party will
supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the
execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary
to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure
Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.3(a) hereof, as the case
may be, or the compliance by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, with
the respective covenants and agreements of such parties contained
herein.  14.6 Current Information. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company will cause one or more of its

status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company will promptly notify Parent of any material change in the normal
course of business or in the operation of the properties of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and of any  45 governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be
contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant litigation
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep Parent fully
informed of such events.  14.7 New Banking Subsidiary. Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause New Bank to be organized as either a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or a direct wholly owned subsidiary of

days after the date on which any request or application for a

been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that
no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal

to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger;  (c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not
have been consummated on or before October 31, 2001, unless the failure of

seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein; provided, however, that if the
Company seeks to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c), it
shall provide written notice to Parent no later than October 29, 2001, and if

representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following
written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with
all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such

Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or
warranty by Parent);  (f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the

and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of its agreements
contained herein, or waive compliance with any of the conditions to its
obligations hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.   52 19 ARTICLE  GENERAL

Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00
