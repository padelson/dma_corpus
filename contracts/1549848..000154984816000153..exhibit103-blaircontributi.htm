repurchase or similar right with respect to the Real Property.

purposes for which it is presently being used is permitted under applicable
zoning Laws and applicable regulations of, and agreements with, Governmental

assessments, reassessments or changes in real property tax basis with respect
to the Real Property or any portion thereof.

list of each current insurance policy which covers Blair or its businesses,
properties, assets or employees (including, without limitation, self-
insurance), and lists whether such policies are 'occurrence' or 'claims made'
policies. Such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums due thereon
have been paid, and Blair is otherwise in compliance in all material respects
with the terms and provisions of such policies. Blair is not in default under
any of the insurance policies set forth on Schedule 4.14 (or required to be

pending claims and the claims history for Blair during the past three (3)
years (including, without limitation, with respect to insurance obtained but

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.1 Tax Returns.

(a) The Parties agree that the income of Blair for the period up to and
including the Closing Date will be reflected on the federal income Tax Return
of Proppants, and that the income of Blair for the period after the Closing
Date will be reflected on the federal income Tax Return of the Partnership, to

allocated to the Partnership), or (ii) for all other Taxes, based on the
closing of the books of Blair as of the end of the Closing Date.

(b) The Parties shall cooperate fully, and cause their Affiliates to cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, to
accomplish the apportionment of income described pursuant to this Section 8.1,
requests for the provision of any information or documentation within the

facilitate compliance with financial reporting obligations arising under FASB
Statement No. 109 (including compliance with Financial Accounting Standards

(each a "Tax Proceeding") with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include access to, the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the
provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any Tax
Return or Tax Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Partnership and Proppants will use reasonable
efforts to cause Blair to, retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to Blair relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Effective Time until the later of six years after the Effective Time or the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods (including any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered

 into with any Tax Authority. The Partnership and Proppants each agree, upon
request, to use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.2 Transfer Taxes. Responsibility for the payment of all state and
local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne

(a) Proppants shall be liable for, shall pay and shall protect, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and its Subsidiaries from and
against all Losses such parties incur arising from (i) any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.8, (ii) any Taxes of
Proppants or its Affiliates arising prior to and including the Closing Date,
(iii) any liability of Blair for the Tax of another Person as a result of
being (A) a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
or (B) a party to any Contract providing for an obligation to indemnify any
other Person for Tax. The Partnership shall be solely liable for, shall pay
and shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Proppants and its
Affiliates (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries) from any and all
Taxes which arise as a result of the ownership of the Contributed Interests
after the Effective Time.

(b) If any claim (an "Indemnified Tax Claim") is made by any Tax Authority
that, if successful, would result in indemnification of any Party (the "Tax
Indemnified Party") by another Party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") under this
Section 8.3, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later
than the earlier of (i) 45 days after receipt of notice from the Tax Authority
of such claim or (ii) 15 days prior to the date required for the filing of any
protest of such claim, notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such
fact.

(c) The Tax Indemnifying Party (in cooperation with the other members of Blair
pursuant to the documents governing the management of the affairs of Blair)
shall control all decisions with respect to any Tax Proceeding involving an
Indemnified Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnified Party shall take such action
(including settlement with respect to such Tax Proceeding or the prosecution
of such Tax Proceeding to a determination in a court or other tribunal of
initial or appellate jurisdiction) in connection with a Tax Proceeding
involving an Indemnified Tax Claim as the Tax Indemnifying Party shall
reasonably request in writing from time to time, including the selection of
counsel and experts and the execution of powers of attorney; provided,
however, that (i) within 30 days after the notice required by Section 8.3(b)
has been delivered (or such earlier date that any payment of Taxes with
respect to such claim is due but in no event sooner than five days after the
Tax Indemnifying Party's receipt of such notice), the Tax Indemnifying Party
requests that such claim be contested, and (ii) if the Tax Indemnified Party
is requested by the Tax Indemnifying Party to pay the Tax claimed and sue for
a refund, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have advanced to the Tax
Indemnified Party, on an interest-free basis, the amount of such claim. The
Tax Indemnified Party shall not make any payment of an Indemnified Tax Claim
for at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required by Law) after
the giving of the notice required by Section 8.3(b) with respect to such
claim, shall give to the Tax Indemnifying Party any information

 requested related to such claim, and otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax
Indemnifying Party in order to contest effectively any such claim.

Section 8.4 Scope. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
ARTICLE VIII shall be the exclusive remedy for any claims relating to Taxes
(including any claims relating to representations respecting Tax matters
including Section 4.8). The rights under this ARTICLE VIII shall survive the
Closing until 30 days after the expiration of the statute of limitations
(including extensions) applicable to such Tax matter. No claim may be made or
brought by any Party hereto after the expiration of the applicable survival
period unless such claim has been asserted by written notice specifying the

survival period. For the avoidance of doubt, this ARTICLE VIII shall not be
subject to the provisions of ARTICLE X.

expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation, warranty
or pre-closing covenant. If a Claim Notice has been timely given in accordance

(b) All covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement to

their terms.

Section 10.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to ARTICLE VIII relating to Taxes and the provisions of this
ARTICLE X, from and after the Closing, Proppants shall indemnify and hold
harmless the

 Partnership, the Partnership's Subsidiaries, and their respective
Representatives (the "Partnership Indemnified Parties") from and against all
Losses that the Partnership Indemnified Parties incur arising from any breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant of Proppants in this Agreement or
in any closing certificate to be delivered by Proppants at the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Subject to ARTICLE VIII relating to Taxes and the provisions of this
ARTICLE X, from and after the Closing, the Partnership shall indemnify and
hold harmless Proppants and its Affiliates (other than the Partnership and its

Parties") from and against all Losses that the Proppants Indemnified Parties
incur arising from or out of any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Partnership in this Agreement or any closing certificate to be
delivered by the Partnership at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

to indemnification under Section 8.3.

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement (other than claims involving a Tax Proceeding, the procedures for
which are set forth in ARTICLE VIII) shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

(a) Any Partnership Indemnified Party or Proppants Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to
any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party ("Third
Party Claim") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification
under Section 10.2 shall promptly (i) notify the Party providing the
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim
and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice ("Claim Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim and a copy
of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any). Failure to timely
provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Party's indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim (unless (i) such Third Party Claim is
asserted against the Indemnifying Party also and the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or
(ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the
Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Claim
and provide indemnification with respect to any Losses arising from Third
Party Claim). If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a
final conclusion or settlement at the

 discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 10.3(b)
and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to
the Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE X for any fees of other counsel or
any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, in
each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such Third Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of
investigation. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement
agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
further, that such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement
agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third
party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim,
(ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction
upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates,
(iii) there is no finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law or
any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other Third
Party Claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, (iv) the sole
relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party and (v) the Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claims. If requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against
the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any
Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense
or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 10.3(b), and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
10.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be
reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified
Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such
defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not
enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if
indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Party's
consent. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 10.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE X, a claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought.

 (e) The Parties hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court
in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of
any Claim that an Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with
respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and agree that
process may be served on any Party with respect to such a claim anywhere in
the world.

(f) The Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall
furnish such information (so long as such information is not subject to any
confidentiality agreements or attorney-client privilege; provided, that the
parties shall take all reasonable measures to fully provide such information
in compliance with such obligations) in reasonable detail as it may have with
respect to a Third Party Claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or
other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) to the
other party if such other party is assuming defense of such Third Party Claim,
and make available all records and other similar materials which are
reasonably required in the defense of such Third Party Claim and shall
otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the defending party in the
defense of such Third Party Claim.

(g) With respect to any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this ARTICLE X: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, as
the case may be, shall keep the other Person reasonably informed of the status
of such Third Party Claims and any related judicial or other proceedings at
all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel and
(ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in
good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third Party Claim.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.3, the
indemnification procedures set forth in ARTICLE VIII shall control any
indemnities relating to Taxes.

Section 10.4 Additional Agreements Regarding Indemnification. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein and subject to ARTICLE VIII relating to Taxes:

breach of the Partnership Fundamental Representations and Warranties or the
Proppants Fundamental Representations and Warranties) in connection with any

$25,000 shall be deemed, for all purposes of this ARTICLE X not to be a breach
of such representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant;

(b) Proppants shall not have any liability arising out of or relating to
Section 10.2(a) for breaches of representations or warranties (other than with

Partnership Indemnified Parties thereunder exceed $2,000,000 (the "Basket"),
and then, subject to Section 10.4(d), only to the extent such aggregate Losses
exceed such amount;

(c) the Partnership shall not have any liability arising out of or relating to
Section 10.2(b) for breaches of representations or warranties (other than with

thereunder exceed the Basket, and then, subject to Section 10.4(e), only to
the extent such aggregate Losses exceed such amount;

(d) in no event shall (i) the aggregate liability of Proppants arising out of

Representations and Warranties) exceed $40,000,000 (the "Cap") and (ii) the
aggregate liability of Proppants arising out of or relating to Section 10.2(a)

Partnership arising out of or relating to Section 10.2(b) for breaches of the
Partnership Fundamental Representations and Warranties exceed $200,000,000;

(f) for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 10.4 shall affect the
provisions of ARTICLE VIII.

(g) for purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.5) has occurred and whether any Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification for any liabilities under this ARTICLE X
arising from any such breach of such representation or warranty and in
calculating the amount of such liabilities, the Parties shall disregard (i)
any requirement in any such representation or warranty that an event or fact
be material, have, or be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect, or otherwise be subject to a similar qualification as to materiality,
material adverse effect or words of similar import and (ii) any other
references to materiality, material adverse effect or words of similar import
in any such representation or warranty.

Section 12.8 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or

any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this

provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent a Party from publishing
such press releases or other public communications as such Party may consider
necessary in order to satisfy such Party's obligations at Law or under the
rules of any stock or commodities exchange after consultation with the other
Party as is reasonable under the circumstances.

Section 12.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, then they shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Texas without regard to the Laws that might be applicable

any disputes between any of the Parties hereto arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any state or federal court
in Houston, Texas, and each of the Parties hereto irrevocably submits to the

out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the
Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction
other than the above specified courts; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of judgment in
any other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by
Law, that a final and unappealable judgment against a Party in any action or
proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of

 such judgment. Except to the extent that a different determination or finding
is mandated due to the Law being that of a different jurisdiction, the Parties
agree that all judicial determinations or findings by a state or federal court
in Houston, Texas with respect to any matter under this Agreement shall be
binding.

(c) To the extent that any Party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in Section 12.11(b).

(d) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
