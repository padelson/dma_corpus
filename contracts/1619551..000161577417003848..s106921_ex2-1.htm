24, 2017, by and among (i) Origo Acquisition Corporation, a Cayman Islands
company (including the Successor from and after the Conversion (as defined
below), "OAC"), (ii) Hightimes Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), (iii) HTHC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a newly-

four fundamental activities, (a) the publication of a monthly magazine, (b)

THC, and the term "Target Companies" means the collective reference to the
Company and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, including THC and its
Subsidiaries;

  



  

B. OAC owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of equity
securities of Merger Sub, which was formed for the sole purpose of the Merger
(as defined below);

  



  

C. The Parties intend to effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the
"Merger"), as a result of which (with the exception of certain stock options)
all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, convertible debt, options,
warrants and other securities or rights to acquire or convert into capital
stock of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined
herein), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate or other instrument
previously representing any such securities shall thereafter represent the
right to receive a pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration (as defined
herein), all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(as amended, the "DGCL"); and

  



  

D. Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Article XI_
hereof.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

  



  

Article I

  

MERGER

  



  

1.1 Merger. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub and the Company shall
consummate the Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, following which the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease to exist and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

1.2 Effective Time. The Parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger for the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company, which shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to OAC (the "Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL. The time of such filing, or such later time as specified in the
Certificate of Merger is referred to herein as the "Effective Time".

  



  

1.3  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts,
liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation, which shall
include the assumption by the Surviving Corporation of any and all agreements,
covenants, duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub set forth in
this Agreement to be performed after the Effective Time.

  



  

1.4  Surviving Corporation Organizational Documents. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation, except that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Hightimes Holding Corp.".

  



  

1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the board of directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the board of directors and officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but after giving effect to  _Section
5.14_ ).

  



  

1.6 Conversion and Organizational Documents of OAC. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, OAC shall reincorporate under the laws of
the State of Nevada, whether by reincorporation, statutory conversion or
otherwise (the "Conversion"), and the Organizational Documents of OAC or its
successor-in-interest after the Conversion (the "Successor") shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to OAC and the Company. In connection with
the Conversion, all of the issued and outstanding OAC Securities shall remain
outstanding and become substantially identical securities of the Successor.

  



  

1.7  Merger Consideration.

  



  

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the respective boards of
directors of each of the Company and OAC have valued the Target Companies at
the sum of Two Hundred and Fifty Million ($250,000,000) Dollars (the "Target
Companies Valuation").

  



  

(b) As consideration for the Merger, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, all holders of Company Securities shall
be entitled to receive in the Merger, an aggregate of Twenty-Three Million
Four Hundred Seventy-Four Thousand One Hundred Seventy-Eight (23,474,178) OAC
Shares (the "Merger Consideration"), which is equal to the Target Companies
Valuation divided by the agreed upon value of the OAC Shares to be issued as
Merger Consideration of $10.65 per share. Each holder of capital stock of the
Company shall receive for each share of capital stock of the Company its pro
rata share of the Merger Consideration, treating any outstanding shares of
Company Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Class A Common Stock basis (and
after deducting from the Merger Consideration payable to such holders of
capital stock, the Purchase Note Conversion Shares issuable to the holders
of outstanding Company Purchase Notes).

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(c) Any options, warrants and other rights to acquire equity
securities of the Company, and all other securities that are convertible into
or exchangeable for equity securities of the Company, including the Company
Purchase Notes that are outstanding as at the Effective Time (collectively,
"Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities"), (A) if exercised or
converted prior to the Effective Time, shall have the resulting shares of
capital stock of the Company issued upon such exercise treated as outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company, and (B) except for the Company
Purchase Notes which shall be converted in accordance with _Section 1.7(e)_
below, any Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities that are not exercised
or converted prior to the Effective Time will be terminated and extinguished
at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company has granted to employees of the Target Companies
Company Options to purchase up to 900,000 shares of Company Class A Common
Stock. Treatment of the Company Options in the Merger shall be as provided in
_Section 1.7(f) _ below.

  



  

(d) The pro-rata portion of the Merger Consideration (less the
Purchase Note Conversion Shares) allocable to each holder of Company Class A
Common Stock, any other outstanding capital stock of the Company and/or
Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities (other than the Company Purchase
Notes, which shall be converted in accordance with _Section 1.7(e)_ below)
shall be determined by dividing (i) the sum of (A) the number of shares of
Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock owned of record
by such Company stockholder, plus (B) the shares of Company Class A Common
Stock or Company Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of
any Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities (other than Company Purchase
Notes) or shares of Company Preferred Stock owned by such Company security
holder, by (ii) 100% of the Company Fully-Diluted Common Stock. As used in
this Agreement, the term "Company Fully-Diluted Common Stock" shall mean the
sum of (A) all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and (B)
all shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of all
Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities (other than the Company Purchase
Notes) or Company Preferred Stock.

  



  

(e) All Company Purchase Notes shall, without any further action on
the part of the holders of the Company Purchase Notes, the Company, OAC or
Merger Sub, be converted as of the Effective Time into that number of OAC
Shares as shall be determined by dividing (i) the then outstanding principal
amount of all Company Purchase Notes, plus any accrued interest thereon, by
(ii) the closing price of the OAC Shares, as traded on an Acceptable
Securities Exchange on the trading day which shall be simultaneously with the
Closing Date and the Effective Time of the Merger (the "Purchase Note
Conversion Shares") based on the automatic conversion provisions provided for
in the Company Purchase Notes. For purposes of this Agreement, the term (i)
"Company Purchase Notes" shall mean the 8% senior secured convertible
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of Thirty Million Dollars
($30,000,000) issued by the Company pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,
dated as December 27, 2016, as amended and restated as of February 14, 2017,
by and among the Company, THC, and the former stockholders of THC (the "THC
Stock Purchase Agreement"), and (ii) "Company Securities" shall mean, at any
point in time, all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company and any Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities, including the
Company Purchase Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (A) the Purchase Note Conversion Shares shall for all purposes of
this Agreement be deemed to be part of and included in the Merger
Consideration contemplated by _Section 1.7(b)_ above and (B) no fractional
shares of OAC Shares will be issued and instead the applicable Merger
Consideration will be rounded in the aggregate for each holder to the nearest
whole number.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(f) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall be automatically assumed by OAC and converted into
an option to purchase OAC Shares under the New Equity Incentive Plan (each, an
"OAC Assumed Option"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
new Equity Incentive Plan, except that the OAC Assumed Options shall
contain the same term and vesting provisions as were set forth in the Company
Option. Each OAC Assumed Option shall (i) have the right to acquire a number
of OAC Shares equal to (as rounded down to the nearest whole number) (A) the
quotient of (I) the number of shares of Common Class A Common Stock which the
Company Option had the right to acquire immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided (II) by the number of shares of Company Fully-Diluted Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the
aggregate number of (x) all Merger Consideration shares, less (y) the Purchase
Note Conversion Shares, and (ii) have an exercise price equal to (as rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) (A) the product of (I) the exercise price of the
Company Option (in U.S. Dollars), multiplied by (II) the number of shares of
Company Fully-Diluted Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (B) the aggregate number of (x) all Merger Consideration shares,
less (y) the Purchase Note Conversion Shares. For the avoidance of doubt any
such OAC Assumed Options shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the
aggregate Merger Consideration under this Agreement and shall dilute on a
pro-rata basis, all holders of OAC Securities, including holders of
Company Securities receiving the Merger Consideration under this Agreement.

  



  

1.8  Effect of Merger on Company Securities. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or
the holders of any Company Securities or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of OAC or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) Subject to Sections 1.8(b) and (c) below, all shares of capital
stock of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to
represent the right to receive its proportionate share of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.7, without interest, upon surrender
of their Company Certificates and delivery of the other required deliveries
under Section 1.11. As of the Effective Time, each holder of capital stock of
the Company shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such capital
stock other than its rights to the Merger Consideration as set forth herein
and except as otherwise required under applicable law.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 1.8(a) above or any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, if there are any
Company Securities that are owned by the Company as treasury shares or any
Company Securities owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Securities shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

(c) Each of the Dissenting Interests issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to
exist and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable
payments set forth in Section 1.14.

  



  

(d) All other equity securities of the Company (other than its
capital stock) and any Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities, in
each case, that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, without any
payment of any consideration therefor, and the holders thereof shall no longer
have any rights with respect thereto, including the right to acquire, convert
into or be exchanged for equity securities of the Company, subject to the
automatic conversion of any Company Purchase Notes and assumption of the
Company Options as OAC Assumed Options as described in Section 1.7 above. The
Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions as are reasonably
necessary in order to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section
1.8(d) and to ensure that no holder of other equity securities of the Company
(other than its capital stock) or Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities
shall have any rights from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
such securities (subject to the automatic conversion of the Company Purchase
Notes and assumption of the Company Options as OAC Assumed Options as
described in Section 1.7 above), provided that such actions shall expressly be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and shall be of no force or
effect if this Agreement is terminated.

1.09 [Intentionally Omitted]

  



  

1.10 Voting Agreements. On or before the close of business on July 31,
2017, and as a condition and inducement to OAC's and Merger Sub's willingness
to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to cause all executive
officers and directors of the Company and all holders of five percent (5%) or
more of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock to execute
and deliver to OAC a voting agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a "Voting Agreement").

  



  

1.11 Surrender of Company Certificates.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall appoint an agent
reasonably acceptable to OAC (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging of certificates and instruments ("Company Certificates") evidencing
Company capital stock, Company Purchase Notes and other Company Common Stock
Equivalent Securities that have been exercised or converted prior to the
Effective Time but for which Company stock certificates have not yet been
issued or which are automatically converted in accordance with Section 1.7
("Uncertificated Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities"). Promptly after
the Effective Time, OAC shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of such Company Securities as of the Effective
Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery of Company Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Company Certificates (if any
were issued) to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  



  

(b) Each holder of Company capital stock, Company Purchase Notes and
Uncertificated Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities shall be entitled
to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable, upon delivery to the Exchange
Agent of the Company Certificates (if any were issued), together with a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, new stock
certificates (or electronically credited shares with OAC's or the
Successor's transfer agent or with The Depository Trust Company) for the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of the number of
shares of capital stock of the Company, Company Purchase Notes and or other
Company Common Stock Equivalent Securities that have been automatically
converted in accordance with Section 1.7 that are owned by such holder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, regardless of whether
any Company Certificate is surrendered, each holder of Company capital stock,
Company Purchase Notes and Uncertificated Company Common Stock Equivalent
Securities (other than Dissenting Interests) shall be entitled to receive
their applicable portion of the Merger Consideration upon the Effective Time
and shall be reflected as owning such Merger Consideration as of the Effective
Time in OAC's and the Surviving Corporation's books and records.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
the event that any Company Certificate which was issued shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, in lieu of delivery of such Company Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, the holder of the applicable Company Security may instead
deliver to the Exchange Agent an affidavit of lost certificate or instrument
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to OAC and the Exchange Agent,
which at the reasonable discretion of OAC may include a requirement that the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or instrument to deliver
a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against OAC or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
certificate or instrument alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Any
affidavit of lost certificate or instrument properly delivered in accordance
with this _Section 1.11(c)_ shall be treated as a valid Company Certificate
for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Company Securities. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Securities are presented to the Surviving Corporation, OAC or the
Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and, if not previously issued,
exchanged for certificates for the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Article I. All securities issued upon the surrender of Company
Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
securities.

  



  

1.12 Effect of Transaction on Merger Sub Stock. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or
any holder of OAC Shares, or the holders of any Company Securities or shares
of common stock of Merger Sub, each share of Merger Sub common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.13 Required Company Approvals. As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, the Company shall prepare a disclosure and information statement
(the "Disclosure Statement") describing in reasonable detail the Merger and
this Agreement and the approvals required by the Company's stockholders for
the approval and adoption by the Company's stockholders of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Company's Organizational Documents and the
DGCL (the "Required Company Stockholder Approval"). The Company shall afford
OAC the opportunity to review and comment upon the Disclosure Statement prior
to its being delivered to such Company stockholders and the Disclosure
Statement shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to OAC. The
Company agrees that the Disclosure Statement shall comply in all material
respects with the DGCL and other applicable Laws. As soon as possible
after the Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the
Company shall (i) distribute the Disclosure Statement and the Registration
Statement to its stockholders, (ii) call a special meeting of its stockholders
to occur as soon as possible thereafter to obtain the Required Company
Stockholder Approval (the "Company Stockholder Meeting"), and (iii) use
its best efforts to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Approval at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (or by written consent as described below),
including strictly enforcing the terms of the Voting Agreements. The Company
shall comply with all applicable Laws, its Organizational Documents and this
Agreement in the preparation of the Disclosure Statement and the distribution
of the Disclosure Statement and the Registration Statement, any solicitation
of proxies thereunder and the calling and holding of the Company Stockholder
Meeting and its efforts to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, after the Registration
Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, seek and obtain the Required
Company Stockholder Approval by the written consent of its stockholders in
accordance with the Company's Organizational Documents and the DGCL. In any
such event, the Company shall promptly thereafter deliver an information
statement and any notices required herein or under the DGCL to its
stockholders that did not consent to the matters required for the Required
Company Stockholder Approval, which information statement and notices shall
be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to OAC and otherwise comply in
all material respects with the DGCL and other applicable Laws. The Company
shall also use its best efforts to obtain the approvals described in
_Sections 7.3(d)(x)_ and _(xi)_.

1.14 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Company capital stock held by a holder who has the right to
dissent to the Merger and demand payment for such shares and properly dissents
and demands payment for the fair value of such Company capital stock
("Dissenting Interests") in accordance with the DGCL, shall not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section 1.7_
, unless such holder withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holder's right to such payment, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
Dissenting Interests shall be deemed outstanding for purposes of determining
the pro rata share of the Merger Consideration payable to other holders of
Company Securities, and the portion of the Merger Consideration
otherwise allocable to a holder of Dissenting Interests shall not be issued
by OAC and shall reduce the overall Merger Consideration payable under this
Agreement. If, after the Effective Time, such holder withdraws, fails to
perfect or loses any such right to payment, such holder's Dissenting
Interests shall be treated as having been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the applicable portion of the total Merger
Consideration as set forth in this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any
holder of Dissenting Interests shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence. The Company shall give prompt
notice to OAC of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company
capital stock and the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand. Except to the extent otherwise
required by the DGCL, the Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless OAC shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer.

  



  

1.15 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

  



  

1.16 Section 368 Reorganization. For U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties hereby (a) adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
United States Treasury Regulations, (b) agree to file and retain such
information as shall be required under Section 1.368-3 of the United States
Treasury Regulations, and (c) agree to file all Tax and other informational
returns on a basis consistent with such characterization. Each of the Parties
acknowledge and agree that each (i) has had the opportunity to obtain
independent legal and tax advice with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for paying its own Taxes,
including any adverse Tax consequences that may result if the Merger is
determined not to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.

described in clause (iv) of the preceding sentence are each true as of their
respective dates of filing. The OAC SEC Reports (x) were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (y) did not, as of their respective effective dates (in the
case of OAC SEC Reports that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and at the time they were filed with the
SEC (in the case of all other OAC SEC Reports) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As
used in this Section 3.6, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to
include any manner permitted by SEC rules and regulations in which a document
or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

  



  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) OAC Shares, OAC Public
Warrants, OAC Public Rights and OAC Public Units are listed on Nasdaq and

Nasdaq.

  



  

(c) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated
by reference in the OAC SEC Reports (the "OAC Financials"), fairly present in
all material respects the financial position and the results of operations,
changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows of OAC at the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements, all in
accordance with (i) GAAP methodologies applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved and (ii) Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as
applicable (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and for the
omission of notes and audit adjustments in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation
S-K, as applicable).

  



  

(d) Except as and to the extent reflected or reserved against in
the OAC Financials, OAC has not incurred any Liabilities or obligations of
the type required to be reflected on a balance sheet in accordance with GAAP

has pending against other Person. Neither OAC nor Merger Sub is subject to any
material Orders of any Governmental Authority. Each of OAC and Merger Sub
holds all Consents necessary to lawfully conduct its business as presently
conducted, and to own, lease and operate its assets and properties, all of
which are in full force and effect, except where the failure to hold such
Consent or for such Consent to be in full force and effect would not

Sub.

corporation) qualifying for, or intended to qualify for, Tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code (A) within the two-year period ending on the

fees or other compensation due to a Target Company, if any. Each Target
Company has performed all obligations imposed on it in the Outbound IP
Licenses, and such Target Company is not, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is any other party thereto, in breach or default thereunder, nor has
any event occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a default thereunder.

  



  

(d) No Action is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge,
threatened that challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or right
to use, sell, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property currently
licensed, used or held for use by the Target Companies that is material to
any Target Company. No Target Company has received any notice or claim
asserting that any infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution or
unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property of any other Person is or may be
occurring or has or may have occurred, in any case, in any material respect,
as a consequence of the business activities of any Target Company. There are
no Orders to which any Target Company is a party or its otherwise bound that,
in any material respect, (i) restrict the rights of a Target Company to use,
transfer, license or enforce any Intellectual Property owned by a Target
Company, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of a Target Company in
order to accommodate a third Person's Intellectual Property, or (iii)
grant any third Person any right with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by a Target Company. No Target Company is currently infringing, or has,
in the past, infringed, misappropriated or violated any Intellectual Property
of any other Person in any material respect. To the Company's Knowledge, no
third party is infringing upon, has misappropriated or is otherwise violating
any Intellectual Property owned, licensed by, licensed to, or otherwise used
or held for use by any Target Company ("Company IP").

(e) To the Company's Knowledge, no Person has obtained
unauthorized access to third party information and data in the possession of
a Target Company, nor has there been any other compromise of the security,
confidentiality or integrity of such information or data. Each Target Company
has complied in all material respects with all applicable domestic and foreign
Laws relating to privacy, personal data protection, and the collection,
processing and use of personal information (including the EU Data Protection
Directive, the EU ePrivacy Directive and the Canadian Personal Information
Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and its own privacy policies and
guidelines. The operation of the business of the Target Companies has not and
does not violate any right to privacy or publicity of any third Person, or
constitute unfair competition or trade practices under applicable Law.

Tax claims or assessments against it (other than, in each case, claims or
assessments for which adequate reserves in the Company Financial Statements

(d) There are no Liens with respect to any Taxes upon any Target
Company's assets, other than Permitted Liens.

the common parent corporation) qualifying for, or intended to qualify for,
Tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) within the two-year

4.15 Real Property.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company nor any Target Company owns any real
property or interests in real property. Schedule 4.15(a) sets forth
a complete list of all real property and interests in real property leased by
any Target Company (collectively, "Company Real Properties") as lessee,
together with a list of all leases, lease guarantees, agreements and documents
related thereto, including all amendments, terminations and modifications
thereof (collectively, the "Company Real Property Leases"), and including the
name of the lessor or lessee, the date of the lease, and a description of the
current annual rent and term under each Company Real Property Lease. The
Target Companies have good and marketable fee title to all Company Owned
Properties, free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except for
Permitted Liens. The Company Real Properties constitute all interests in real
property currently used, occupied or currently held for use in connection with
the business of the Target Companies and which are necessary for the
continued operation of the business of the Target Companies as the business is
currently conducted. All of the Company Real Properties and buildings,
fixtures and improvements thereon are suitable, sufficient and appropriate
in all respects for their current and contemplated uses. None of the
improvements located on the Company Real Properties constitute a legal non-
conforming use or otherwise require any special dispensation, variance or
special permit under any Laws. The Company has delivered to OAC true, correct
and complete copies of the Company Real Property Leases, together with all
amendments, modifications or supplements, if any, thereto. The Company Real
Properties are not subject to any subleases, sublicenses, occupancy or
rights of occupancy by any third parties.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(b) Each Target Company has a valid, binding and enforceable
leasehold interest under each of the Company Leased Properties under which it
is a lessee, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Each of
the Company Real Property Leases is in full force and effect. No Target
Company is in default under any Company Real Property Lease, and no event has
occurred and no circumstance exists which, if not remedied, and whether with
or without notice or the passage of time or both, would result in such a
default. No Target Company has received or given any notice of any default or
event that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default
by a Target Company under any of the Company Real Property Leases and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no other party is in default thereof. No party to
any Company Real Property Lease has exercised any termination rights with
respect thereto.

  



  

(c) The Target Companies have all certificates of occupancy and
Permits of any Governmental Authority necessary or useful for the current use
and operation of each Company Real Property, and the Target Companies have
fully complied with all material conditions of the Permits applicable to
them. No default or violation, or event that with the lapse of time or giving
of notice or both would become a default or violation, has occurred in the
due observance of any such Permit.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.15(d), no Target Company
owns, holds, is obligated under or is a party to, any option, right of first
refusal or other contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell, assign or
dispose of any real estate or any portion thereof or interest therein.

its Cannabis Cup Events in compliance with all applicable Laws, and only

("Environmental Permits"), no Action is pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened to revoke, modify, or terminate any such Environmental

capital expenditures to achieve or maintain such continued compliance with
Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits.

  



  

(b) No Target Company is the subject of any outstanding Order or
Contract with any Governmental Authority or other Person in respect of any
(i) Environmental Laws, (ii) Remedial Action, or (iii) Release or threatened
Release of a Hazardous Material. No Target Company has assumed, contractually
or by operation of Law, any Liabilities under any Environmental Laws.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(c) No Action has been made or is pending, or to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened against any Target Company or any assets of a Target
Company alleging either or both that a Target Company may be in violation of
any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or may have any Liability under
any Environmental Law.

  



  

(d) No Target Company has manufactured, treated, stored, disposed
of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, generated, handled or released
any Hazardous Material, or owned or operated any property or facility, in a
manner that has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Liability or obligation under applicable Environmental Laws. No fact,
circumstance, or condition exists in respect of any Target Company or any
property currently or formerly owned, operated, or leased by any Target
Company or any property to which a Target Company arranged for the disposal
or treatment of Hazardous Materials that could reasonably be expected to
result in a Target Company incurring any Environmental Liabilities. There is
not located at any of the properties of a Target Company any (i) underground
storage tanks, (ii) asbestos-containing material, or (iii) equipment
containing polychlorinated biphenyls.

  



  

(e) There is no investigation of the business, operations, or
currently owned, operated, or leased property of a Target Company or, to
the Company's Knowledge, previously owned, operated, or leased property of a
Target Company pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened that could
lead to the imposition of any Environmental Liabilities or Liens under any
Environmental Law.

  



  

4.18 Personal Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to any Target Company, each
Target Company is in possession of and has good and marketable title to, or
valid leasehold interests in or valid rights under contract to use, the
Personal Property owned, leased or used by the Target Company, free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

  



  

4.19 Title to and Sufficiency of Assets. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.19, each Target Company has good and marketable title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in or right to use, all of its assets, free and clear

Property rights and contractual rights) of the Target Companies constitute all
of the assets, rights and properties that are used in the operation of the
businesses of the Target Companies as it is now conducted and
presently proposed to be conducted or that are used or held by the Target
Companies for use in the operation of the businesses of the Target Companies,
and taken together, are adequate and sufficient for the operation of the
businesses of the Target Companies as currently conducted and as presently
proposed to be conducted.

(a) No Target Company is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or other Contract with any group of employees, labor
organization or other representative of any of the employees of any Target
Company and the Company has no Knowledge of any activities or proceedings of
any labor union or other party to organize or represent such employees. There
has not occurred or, to the Knowledge of the Company, been threatened any
strike, slow-down, picketing, work-stoppage, or other similar labor activity

threatened against a Target Company brought by or on behalf of any applicant

such Law or regulation, or alleging breach of any express or implied Contract
of employment, wrongful termination of employment, or alleging any other
discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the
employment relationship.

been made by a Target Company, or any predecessor thereof, or under which any
employee, former employee, director, agent or independent contractor of a
Target Company or any beneficiary thereof is covered, is eligible for
coverage or has benefit rights (each, a "Company Benefit Plan"). With
respect to each Company Benefit Plan, there are no funded benefit obligations
for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are
no unfunded benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by reserves,
or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP on the Company
Financial Statements. No Target Company is or has in the past been a member of
a "controlled group" for purposes of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code, nor does any Target Company have any Liability with respect to any
collectively-bargained for Benefit Plans, whether or not subject to the

any Target Company to any Person with regard to any Company Benefit Plan that
was not in accordance with the terms of a Company Benefit Plan in any
respect.

  



  

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been operated at all
times in compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code. Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (i) has been determined by the IRS
to be so qualified (or is maintained in all respects in accordance with the
terms of a prototype plan which has received a favorable opinion letter)
during the period from its adoption to the date of this Agreement and
(ii) its related trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code or the Target Companies have requested an initial
favorable U.S. Internal Revenue Service determination of qualification and/or
exemption within the period permitted by applicable Law. No fact exists which
could adversely affect the qualified status of such Company Benefit Plans
or the exempt status of such trusts.

  



  

(c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which covers any
current or former officer, director, consultant or employee (or
beneficiary thereof) of a Target Company, the Company has provided to OAC
accurate and complete copies, if applicable, of: (i) all Company Benefit Plan

Action is pending, or to the Company's Knowledge, threatened (other than

4975 of the Code, has occurred, excluding transactions effected pursuant to a
statutory or administration exemption; and (v) all contributions and premiums

32

 



    



  

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "defined benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 414(j) of the Code), a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (as
described in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is otherwise subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no Target Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any Liability or otherwise could have any
Liability, contingent or otherwise, under Title IV of ERISA and no condition
presently exists that is expected to cause such Liability to be incurred. No
Company Benefit Plan will become a multiple employer plan with respect to any
Target Company immediately after the Closing Date. No Target Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate currently maintains or contributes to, or has ever maintained
or contributed to or in any way directly or indirectly had any
Liability (whether contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
"multiemployer plan," within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA. No Target Company currently maintains or has ever maintained, or is
required currently or has ever been required to contribute to or otherwise
participate in, a multiple employer welfare arrangement or voluntary
employees' beneficiary association as defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.

  



  

(f) There is no arrangement under any Company Benefit Plan with
respect to any employee that would result in the payment of any amount
that by operation of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code would not be
deductible by the Target Companies and no arrangement exists pursuant to
which a Target Company will be required to "gross up" or otherwise compensate
any Person because of the imposition of any Tax on a payment to such Person.

  



  

(g) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which is a "welfare
plan" (as described in Section 3(1) of ERISA): (i) no such plan provides
medical or death benefits with respect to current or former employees of a
Target Company beyond their termination of employment (other than coverage
mandated by Law, which is paid solely by such employees); and (ii) there are
no reserves, assets, surplus or prepaid premiums under any such plan. Each
Target Company has complied with the provisions of Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.

  



  

(h) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.21(h), the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
will not: (i) entitle any individual to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or other benefits or compensation; (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation due, or in
respect of, any individual; (iii) result in or satisfy a condition to the
payment of compensation that would, in combination with any other payment,
result in an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code. No Target Company has incurred any Liability for any Tax imposed
under Chapter 43 of the Code or civil liability under Section 502(i) or (l) of
ERISA.

  



  

(i) Except to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state Law, no Target Company provides health or welfare benefits to
any former or retired employee or is obligated to provide such benefits to any
active employee following such employee's retirement or other termination of
employment or service.

  



  

(j) All Company Benefit Plans can be terminated at any time as of
or after the Closing Date without resulting in any liability to the Company
or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates for any additional
contributions, penalties, premiums, fees, fines, excise taxes or any other
charges or liabilities.

  



   

33

 



    



  

(k) Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code (each, a "Section 409A Plan") as of the Closing Date is indicated as
such on Schedule 4.21(k). No Company Options or other equity-based awards have
been issued or granted by the Company that are, or are subject to, a Section
409A Plan. Each Section 409A Plan has been administered in compliance, and is
in documentary compliance, with the applicable provisions of Section 409A of
the Code, the regulations thereunder and other official guidance issued
thereunder. No Target Company has any obligation to any employee or other
service provider with respect to any Section 409A Plan that may be subject to
any Tax under Section 409A of the Code. No payment to be made under any
Section 409A Plan is, or to the Knowledge of the Company will be, subject to
the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. There is no Contract or plan
to which any Target Company is a party or is bound to compensate any employee,
consultant or director for Lability and/or Taxes incurred under Section 409A
of the Code.

  



  

4.22 Transactions with Related Persons. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.22, no Target Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
officer, director, manager, employee, trustee or beneficiary of a Target
Company or any of its Affiliates, nor any immediate family member of any of
the foregoing (whether directly or indirectly through an Affiliate of such
Person) (each of the foregoing, a "Related Person") is presently or in the
past three (3) years has been, a party to any transaction, Contract,
commitment or other arrangement with a Target Company that would be required
to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC
in a Form 10-K or proxy statement pertaining to an annual meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

4.23 Insurance.

  



  

(a) Schedule 4.23(a) lists all insurance policies (by policy number,
insurer, coverage period, coverage amount, annual premium, type of policy and
scope of coverage) held by a Target Company relating to a Target Company or
its business, properties, assets, directors, officers and employees, copies
of which have been provided to OAC. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to a Target Company,
each such insurance policy (i) is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in
full force and effect and (ii) will continue to be legal, valid, binding,
enforceable, and in full force and effect on identical terms following the
Closing. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to a Target Company, no Target Company is in default
with respect to its obligations under any insurance policy, nor has any Target
Company ever been denied insurance coverage for any reason. No Target Company
has any self-insurance or co-insurance programs. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to a
Target Company, since April 1, 2012, no Target Company has received any
notice from, or on behalf of, any insurance carrier relating to or involving
any adverse change or any change other than in the ordinary course of
business, in the conditions of insurance, any refusal to issue an
insurance policy or non-renewal of a policy, or requiring or suggesting
material alteration of any of the assets of a Target Company, purchase of
additional equipment or material modification of any of the methods of doing
business by a Target Company.

  



  

(b) Schedule 4.23(b) identifies each individual insurance claim made
by a Target Company since April 1, 2012. Each Target Company has reported to
its insurers all claims and pending circumstances that would reasonably be
expected to result in a claim, except where such failure to report such a
claim would not be reasonably likely to be material to the Target Companies.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to (with or
without notice or lapse of time) give rise to or serve as a basis for the
denial of any such insurance claim. No Target Company has made any claim

Securities of the Successor to the holders of OAC Securities and (ii) the
issuance in the Merger of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company
Securities in accordance with Article I, and containing a proxy
statement/prospectus for the purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of OAC
Shares for the matters to be acted upon at the Special Meeting (as defined
below) and providing such holders an opportunity in accordance with the OAC
Charter and the IPO Prospectus to have their OAC Shares redeemed (the
"Closing Redemption Offer") in conjunction with the stockholder vote on the
OAC Stockholder Approval Matters. The Registration Statement shall include
proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of OAC
Shares to vote, at an extraordinary general meeting of OAC stockholders to be

resolutions approving (A) this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the Conversion, (C) the New
Equity Incentive Plan, (D) such other matters as the Company and OAC shall

Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of OAC. In
connection with the Registration Statement, OAC will file with the SEC
financial and other information about the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and applicable proxy solicitation
rules set forth in the OAC Charter, the Cayman Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq (and, if the Parties anticipate using an
Acceptable Securities Exchange as of the Closing, such Acceptable Securities
Exchange). OAC shall cooperate and provide the Company (and its counsel) with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Registration Statement
and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to filing the same with the
SEC. The Company shall provide OAC with such information concerning the Target
Companies and their stockholders, officers, directors, employees, assets,
liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) business and operations that
may be required or appropriate (including as reasonably requested by OAC or
its legal counsel or, after the filing of the initial preliminary
Registration Statement, by the SEC in its review of the Registration
Statement) for inclusion in the Registration Statement, or in any amendments
or supplements thereto, including business description narratives, risk
factors, management description and analysis of financial information,
management information, security holder information and other information
required by applicable securities Laws (all such information, collectively,

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, OAC,
at its sole election and expense, may prepare, with the assistance of the
Company, and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and with all other
applicable regulatory bodies, materials in the form of a proxy statement (the
"Extension Proxy Statement") to be used for the purpose of soliciting proxies
from the holders of OAC Shares to approve, at a special meeting of the
holders of OAC Shares (the "Extension Meeting"), an amendment to the OAC
Charter to extend the deadline for OAC to consummate its initial business
combination (the "Extension") from September 12, 2017 to December 12, 2017
(or such earlier date as OAC may determine, the "Extension Date"), and
providing such holders with an opportunity to have their OAC Shares redeemed
in connection therewith (the "Extension Redemption Offer" and, together with
the Closing Redemption Offer, the "Redemption Offers").

  



  

(c) The Parties shall take any and all reasonable and necessary
actions required to satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws in connection with the
Registration Statement, the Special Meeting, the Extension Proxy Statement,
the Extension Meeting and the Redemption Offers. Each Party shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make their respective directors, officers
and employees, upon reasonable advance notice, available to the Company, OAC
and, after the Closing, the OAC Representative, and their respective
Representatives in connection with the drafting of the public filings
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Registration Statement and, if applicable, the Extension Proxy Statement,
and responding in a timely manner to comments from the SEC. Each Party shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Registration
Statement or the Extension Proxy Statement (and other related materials) if
and to the extent that such information is determined to have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Laws. OAC shall amend or supplement the Registration Statement and, if
applicable, the Extension Proxy Statement and cause such Registration
Statement or Extension Proxy Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders of OAC Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the OAC Charter.

(d)  The Parties, with the assistance of the other Parties, shall
promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement or the
Extension Proxy Statement and shall otherwise use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Extension
Proxy Statement to "clear" comments from the SEC and be declared effective by
the SEC. Each Party shall provide the Company and OAC with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any material oral comments,

staff with respect to the Registration Statement, the Special Meeting, the

no later than thirty (30) days following such "clearing" of comments.

applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq, its Organizational Documents and
this Agreement in the preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration

of this Agreement as required by applicable securities Laws, which the
Company shall review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not be

(the "Closing Press Release"). Promptly after the issuance of the Closing
Press Release, OAC shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Closing
Filing") with the Closing Press Release and a description of the Closing as
required by applicable securities Laws, which the OAC Representative shall

preparation of the Signing Press Release, the Signing Filing, the Closing
Filing, the Closing Press Release, or any other report, statement, filing
notice or application made by or on behalf of a Party to any Governmental
Authority or other third party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, each Party shall, upon request by any other
Party, furnish the Parties with all information concerning themselves, their
respective directors, officers and equity holders, and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions

5.14 Post-Closing Board of Directors.

  



  

(a)  The Parties shall take all necessary action, including causing
the directors of OAC to resign, so that effective at the Closing, the entire
board of directors of the Successor (the "Post-Closing Board") will consist of
seven (7) individuals, a majority of which shall be independent directors in
accordance with Nasdaq requirements (or if applicable, the requirements of
another Acceptable Securities Exchange on which OAC Shares are listed or
intended to be listed). The directors shall be classified, with respect to
the time for which they shall hold their respective offices, by dividing them
into three classes, to be known as "Class I," "Class II" and "Class III."
Each director shall hold office for a three-year term or until the next
annual meeting of stockholders at which his or her successor is elected and
qualified (provided, that the first annual meeting of stockholders will not
be held prior to the one year anniversary of the Effective Time). At each
annual meeting of stockholders, successors to the directors of the class
whose term of office expires at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold
office until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, so that the
term of office of only one class of directors shall expire at each annual
meeting. The number of directors in each class, which shall be such that as
near as possible to one-third and at least one-fourth (or such other fraction
as required by the Nevada Revised Statutes) in number are elected at each
annual meeting, shall be established from time to time by resolution of the
board of directors and shall be increased or decreased by resolution of the
board of directors, as may be appropriate whenever the total number of
directors is increased or decreased. Two (2) of the seven (7) members of the
Post-Closing Board shall be individuals (at least one of whom shall be
an independent director) designated by OAC prior to the Effective Time (the
"OAC Directors"). Four (4) of the members of the Post-Closing Board (at least
three (3) of whom shall be independent directors) shall be designated by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, and the seventh (7th) member of the
Post-Closing Board shall be an individual selected by the Company prior to
the Effective Time as the Chief Executive Officer of OAC and the Successor.
The OAC Directors shall each serve as Class I directors and for a term of not
less than one (1) year following the Effective Time of the Merger and may
not be removed during such one (1) year period without the prior written
consent of the OAC Representative. In the event of a resignation or death of
an OAC Director during such one (1) year period, the OAC Representative may
appoint a replacement OAC Director. The currently proposed Post-Closing
Board, including initial OAC Directors and the initial directors selected by
the Company to serve on the Post-Closing Board, are set forth on Schedule
5.14(a) hereto.

(b) The board of directors of the Company immediately after the
Closing shall be the same as the Post-Closing Board.

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Closing, OAC will provide each member of the
Post-Closing Board with a director service agreement and customary director
indemnification agreement, each in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such director.

  



  

5.15  New Equity Incentive Plan. Prior to the Special Meeting,
OAC's board of directors will adopt on behalf of OAC and/or the Successor a
new equity incentive plan, which will be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "New Equity Incentive Plan"). OAC will submit
the approval of the New Equity Incentive Plan to its stockholders for
their ratification and approval at the Special Meeting. The New Equity
Incentive Plan will provide for awards for a number of OAC Shares (including
those for the OAC Assumed Options) equal to up to ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate number of OAC Shares issued and outstanding immediately after the
Closing.

  



  

5.16  Use of Trust Account Proceeds After the Closing.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that after the Closing, the funds in the Trust
Account shall first be used (i) to pay OAC's accrued Expenses for the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
expenses incurred in connection with the Extension, (ii) to pay any OAC
Deferred Expenses (including underwriting commissions payable to the
underwriters and any legal fees) and (iii) to pay any outstanding amounts
owed under the OAC Management Convertible Note that are not converted into
OAC Shares and other amounts owed to the OAC Sponsor Group or EBC. Such
amounts will be paid at the Closing. Any remaining cash will be used for
general corporate purposes.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, express or implied
contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto do hereby agree that in order
for the Parties to be required to consummate the Closing under this
Agreement, at the Closing, after the payment of all of the items set forth in
_Section 5.16(a)_ and payment of the Redemption Offers, OAC shall have net
tangible assets, substantially all of which shall be in cash or immediately
marketable securities of not less than $5,000,001. In the event that for any
reason, the provisions of this Section 5.16(b) cannot be achieved, the
holders of the OAC Management Convertible Note and the OAC Sponsor Group
shall convert into OAC Private Units, at a conversion price of $10.00 per
unit, an applicable principal amount of the OAC Management Convertible Note
or any other amounts owed to the OAC Sponsor Group so as to ensure that the
net tangible assets of OAC at the Closing, after the payment of all of the
items set forth in _Section 5.16(a)_ and payment of the Redemption
Offers, shall be not less than $5,000,001.

5.18 Supplemental Disclosure Schedules. During the period from
the date of this Agreement until the initial Registration Statement is
filed by OAC with the SEC in accordance with _Section 5.11_ , each of the
Company, on the one hand, and OAC and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
have the right, by providing one or more written supplemental disclosure
schedules ("Supplemental Disclosure Schedules") to the other parties, to
update its Disclosure Schedules to disclose updates: (a) to reflect changes
in the ordinary course of business first existing or occurring after the date
of this Agreement, which if existing or occurring on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth on such schedules,
and (b) which updates do not result from any breach of a covenant made by
such disclosing Party or its Affiliates in this Agreement. Other than any
updates permitted by the prior sentence, no Supplemental Disclosure Schedule
shall affect any of the conditions to the Parties' respective obligations
under the Agreement (including for purposes of determining satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII), or any other remedy
available to the Parties arising from a representation or warranty that
was or would be inaccurate, or a warranty that would be breached, without
qualification by the update.

Article IX

  

TRUST FUND WAIVER

  



  

9.1  Waiver of Claims Against Trust. Reference is made to
the IPO Prospectus. The Company warrants and represents that it has read the
IPO Prospectus and understands that the OAC has established the Trust Account
containing the proceeds of the IPO and the OAC Private Placement (including
interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of OAC's public
stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by OAC's underwriters)
(the "Public Stockholders") and that, except as otherwise described in the
IPO Prospectus, OAC may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to
the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their OAC Shares in
connection with the consummation of OAC's initial business combination (as
such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) ("Business Combination"), (b) to the
Public Stockholders if OAC fails to consummate a Business Combination by
September 12, 2017 or such earlier date as determined by OAC's directors
(as extended by the Initial Extension, the Second Extension and Third
Extension, and as it may be further extended by the Extension), (c) with
respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account
necessary to pay any taxes or for working capital requirements or (d) to OAC
after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and
in consideration of the OAC entering into this Agreement and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor its Affiliates does now or shall at any time hereafter
have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in
the Trust Account or distributions therefrom that are paid directly or
indirectly through OAC to Public Stockholders ("Public Distributions"), or
make any claim against the Trust Account (including any Public
Distributions), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual business
relationship between the OAC or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, this Agreement or any
other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to hereafter as the "Released Claims"). The Company
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released
Claims that the Company or its Affiliates may have against the Trust Account
(including any Public Distributions) now or in the future as a result of, or
arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with OAC or its
Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
(including any Public Distributions) for any reason whatsoever (including for
an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with OAC or its
Affiliates). The Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver
is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by OAC and its
Affiliates to induce OAC to enter in this Agreement, and the Company further
intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable under
applicable Law. To the extent the Company or any of its Affiliates commences
any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to the OAC or its Representatives, which
proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the OAC or its
Representatives, the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees its sole remedy
shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim
shall not permit the Company or any of its Affiliates (or any Person claiming
on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim against the
Trust Account (including any Public Distributions) or any amounts
contained therein. In the event that the Company or any of its Affiliates
commences an Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising
out of any matter relating to OAC or its Representatives which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
Public Distributions) or the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of money
damages or injunctive relief, OAC and its Representatives shall be entitled
to recover from the Company and its Affiliates the associated legal fees and
costs in connection with any such Action, in the event the OAC or its
Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such Action. For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of this _Section 9.1_ , the members of the OAC Sponsor
Group shall be deemed to be Affiliates of OAC. This _Section 9.1_ shall
survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.
