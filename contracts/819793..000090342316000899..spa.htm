Section 2.3   _Purchase Price Adjustment._

  

(a)   _Final Working Capital Closing Date Calculation_. Within
ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the

During the Review Period and, if applicable, the Discussion Period (as

Subsidiary, Seller and its accountants, attorneys and other representatives
shall have full access to the books and records of the Company and the Company

11 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

  

documents on which the calculation of the Final Working Capital Closing Date
Calculation is based, or which may be useful or helpful to Seller's
accountants or advisors, including the working papers of the Company and
(subject to customary indemnification letters) its accountants and other
representatives, if any, prepared in connection with the Final Working Capital
Closing Date Calculation. Purchaser hereby agrees that following the Closing
Date and prior to the completion of the determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price hereunder, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the

of the books and records of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, or any

Final Working Capital Closing Date Calculation, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser within the Review Period a written notice of dispute (a " _Dispute
Notice_ "), which shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the items and
amounts in dispute. If Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice on or before

irrevocably accepted such Final Working Capital Closing Date Calculation, and
the Final Working Capital set forth therein shall be deemed to be the Actual
Working Capital for purposes of payment (if any) contemplated by _Section
2.3(e)_. Purchaser and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the
dispute within twenty (20) Business Days (the " _Discussion Period_ ")
commencing on the date Purchaser receives the Dispute Notice from Seller;
_provided_ that no item or amount which comprises the Initial Purchase Price
calculation shall be in dispute, as all such other items and amounts shall
have been definitively determined by the Parties hereto on or before the
Closing Date. If Seller and Purchaser do not obtain a final resolution within
the Discussion Period, then the items remaining in dispute may be submitted
thereafter for resolution to BDO USA LLP, or if such firm refuses or is unable
to serve in such capacity, or is otherwise not appointed and engaged for such
purpose (including due to a conflict of interest), then another independent
nationally recognized accounting firm to be agreed upon by Seller and
Purchaser acting reasonably (either such firm, as the case may be, the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be engaged to serve as an
accountant, and not as an arbitrator, and the terms of appointment and
engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be consistent therewith, consistent
with this _Section 2.3_ , and otherwise as agreed upon between Seller and
Purchaser, and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser; _provided_ that
such fees shall ultimately be allocated in accordance with _Section
2.3(b)(ii)_. Seller and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to
direct the Accounting Firm to render a determination (the " _Determination_
") of the dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after referral of the
matter to the Accounting Firm, which Determination must be in writing and must
set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. In making the
Determination regarding such dispute, the Accounting Firm shall select, with
respect to each item in dispute, an amount equal to either Purchaser's
position as set forth in the Final Working Capital Closing Date
Calculation or Seller's position, as set forth in the Dispute Notice. In
connection with the resolution of such dispute, the Accounting Firm shall
have access to all documents, records, work papers, facilities and personnel
necessary to make the Determination, and the Determination shall be based on
and in accordance with the same accounting principles, methods, practices,
categories, estimates, judgments and assumptions, as were used in preparing
the Balance Sheet. Each of Seller and Purchaser and their respective
representatives shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Accounting Firm

any material such party deems relevant to the Determination, provided that
such material and its applications would be in accordance with _Section
2.3(f)_ , and shall have a continuing opportunity to discuss the matter and
its position with the Accounting Firm, but no such presentation of materials
or communication shall be on an ex parte basis unless agreed to in writing by
the other party. The Determination shall be final, conclusive and binding
absent fraud or manifest error upon Seller, the Company and Purchaser, and
shall not be deemed an award subject to review under the Federal Arbitration
Act or applicable Law. The procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3_ are the
sole and exclusive mechanism for the adjustment of the Initial Purchase
Price.

  

(ii)  In the event Seller or Purchaser submit any items
remaining in dispute to the Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in
_Section 2.3(b)(i)_ , the responsibility for the fees and expenses of such
Accounting Firm shall be as follows:

  

(A)  if such Accounting Firm resolves all of the applicable items
remaining in dispute in favor of Purchaser's position, then all of the fees
and expenses of such Accounting Firm (and the reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses of Purchaser related thereto) shall be paid by Seller;

  

(B)  if such Accounting Firm resolves all of the applicable items
remaining in dispute in favor of Seller's position, then all of the fees and
expenses of such Accounting Firm (and the reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses of Seller related thereto) shall be paid by Purchaser; and

  

(C)  if such Accounting Firm neither resolves all of the
applicable items remaining in dispute in favor of Purchaser's position nor
resolves all of the applicable remaining objections in favor of Seller's
position, then fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm (and the reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses of the parties related thereto) shall be paid in
inverse proportion as Seller or Purchaser may prevail on matters resolved by
the Accounting Firm, which inverse proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the Determination is made.

  

(c)   _Final and Binding Determination_. The amount of Working
Capital of the Company as of 11:59 p.m. on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date as agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser (which shall
be the Final Working Capital if Seller does not timely deliver a Dispute
Notice), or as results from the Determination, as applicable, shall be
conclusive and binding on all Parties hereto and shall be deemed the "
_Actual Working Capital_ " for all purposes hereunder.

  

(d)   _Adjustment of Initial Purchase Price_. Upon the final
determination of the Actual Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ ,
the Initial Purchase Price shall either be increased by the amount, if any, by
which the Actual Working Capital is greater than $40,300,000 or decreased by
the amount, if any, by which the Actual Working Capital is less than
$30,300,000.

  

(e)  The Initial Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_ shall be deemed to be the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ ".

reduction to the Initial Purchase Price calculated pursuant to _Section
2.3(d)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an account
or accounts specified by Purchaser, within three (3) Business Days after the
date on which the Adjusted Purchase Price is finally determined. Purchaser
shall pay Seller the amount of any increase to the Initial Purchase Price
calculated pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account or accounts specified by Seller, within three
(3) Business Days after the date on which the Adjusted Purchase Price is
finally determined.

  

(f)   _Accounting Principles_. The manner in which the Final
Working Capital Closing Date Calculation, the Current Assets, the Current
Liabilities and the Actual Working Capital are determined and the
Determination is made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be in the same
manner, and using the same accounting principles, methods, practices,
categories, estimates, judgments and assumptions, as were used in preparing
the Balance Sheet. A sample calculation of Working Capital as of December 31,
2015 derived from the Balance Sheet is set forth on _Exhibit A_.

to Seller's knowledge, threatened, disputes, arbitrations, claims, suits or
grievances involving an Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for

of the Code has been terminated other than in a standard termination. None of
the Company, the Company Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates has incurred
any "withdrawal liability" in respect of any Multiemployer Plan which remains
unsatisfied.

  

(f)  None of the Company, the Company Subsidiary nor, with
respect to the Business, the Contributing Affiliate, or their
respective Affiliates has engaged in any transaction with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably likely to subject the Company

imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law.

available to Purchaser copies, to the extent applicable, of (i) the plan

(h)  Except as provided for in this Agreement, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and performance of
the transactions contemplated hereby, will not (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) constitute an event
under any Employee Benefit Plan that will or may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits, or (ii) result in any payment that

    

23

could reasonably be characterized as an excess parachute payment" under
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiary
has the contractual obligation to indemnify, hold harmless or gross-up any
individual with respect to any tax, penalty or interest under Sections 4999,

use, all of the material Intellectual Property Rights used in or necessary

and, with respect to the Business, the Contributing Affiliate have not
asserted or made any claims against any third party relating to the
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual
Property Rights owned or licensed by the Company, the Company Subsidiary, or
with respect to the Business, Contributing Affiliate and included in the
Company Intellectual Property Rights.

  

(d)  None of Seller, the Company, the Company Subsidiary or,
with respect to the Business, the Contributing Affiliate nor the Assigned
Assets are bound by any Contract that, upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will cause Purchaser, any of its Affiliates,
the Company or the Company Subsidiary to (i) grant to any third Person any
right to or with respect to any Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or
licensed to, any of them prior to the Closing or (ii) be obligated to pay
any material royalties or other fees or consideration with respect to
Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person in excess of those payable
by the Company or the Company Subsidiary in the absence of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

has any ownership, claim or right (other than non-exclusive license rights
granted to the United States government under a Government Contract) in or to

in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described
in this clause (i); (ii) Purchaser shall give Seller notice of at least two

any of its representatives conducts its or their investigations on such

environmental media or product; (iv) Purchaser shall (A) use its reasonable
best efforts to perform all on-site due diligence reviews and all

Losses resulting from physical damage or personal harm directly caused by
Purchaser or any of its representatives under this paragraph; (v) such access
shall be conditioned upon compliance by Purchaser and its authorized
representatives with all applicable security procedures and protocol regarding
the protection of confidential and classified information of Seller and its
Affiliates, and only those of Purchaser's personnel who are
specifically authorized to have such access shall gain such access; and (vi)
such access shall not result in the waiver of any applicable attorney-
client privilege or work-product doctrine. The foregoing indemnification
obligation shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

  

(b)  Purchaser agrees that it will, and will cause its
Affiliates and its and their representatives to, keep confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement all documents, materials and
other information which it shall have obtained regarding Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than, from and after the Closing Date, any such documents,
materials and other information exclusively relating to the Business) during
the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this
Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this
Agreement and other related documents; _provided_ , _however_ that Purchaser
shall be permitted to disclose such information to lenders and prospective
lenders in connection with increasing the amount available for borrowing under

as Representatives of Purchaser in accordance with, and as defined in, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

(c)  From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause

provide Purchaser with reasonably prompt written notice of such requirement,
(ii) disclose only that information that it determines (with the advice of
counsel) is so required by such applicable Law to be disclosed and (iii)
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser at Purchaser's expense so that Purchaser
may seek to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such non-public information shall not include
information that (A) is or becomes available to the public after the Closing
other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Section 5.2(c) or (B)
becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates or representatives after the
Closing from a source other than Purchaser or its Affiliates or
representatives if the source of such information is not known by Seller or
its representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, Purchaser or
its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiary) with respect
to such information.

(a)  Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each
of the Parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts (except where a
different efforts standard is specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in
which case such different standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents of all
Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, in the case of

national or supranational antitrust or competition filings, notifications or
approvals and (ii) no Party shall be obligated to make any payments or make
any commitments in order to obtain any third party consent (other than
Purchaser's obligation to arrange guarantees as described above).

soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall

transactions contemplated by the Agreement which such notice shall seek
written confirmation that: (1) the FAA will issue new FAA Permits allowing
the Company to continue operating as a FAA repair station, perform

transactions covered by this Agreement and that following Closing (including
to the extent the FAA Permits existing as of the date hereof will be
transferred to Purchaser), the FAA Permits shall remain in full force and
effect. For the avoidance of doubt, no such confirmation contemplated by the
foregoing sentence shall serve as a condition precedent to the Closing. The
Parties shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
notification, including by permitting the other party to review in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
any proposed written communication with the FAA and any other information
supplied to the FAA or received from the FAA in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly inform the
other party of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for
information from, the FAA in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement and shall consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference, whether in person or by telephone, with the FAA.

  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.3(a)_ , as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than ten (10) days after
the date of this Agreement, each party hereto shall make an appropriate
filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act. Any other notifications, filings and request for approvals relating to
any other national or supranational antitrust or competition requirements
shall be made as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to the HSR Act and any other
national or supranational antitrust or competition requirements Seller, the
Company, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates (i) shall not extend any
waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or any foreign
antitrust Law or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _Timing Agreement_
"), except with the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, (ii)
shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of
all filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(c)_ , including subject to applicable Law, by permitting counsel
for the other party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority and by providing outside counsel
for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by such
party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any
Governmental Authority and any other information supplied by such party and
such party's Subsidiaries to a Governmental Authority or received from such a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) shall furnish to the other Parties such information and
assistance as such Parties reasonably may request in connection with the
preparation of any submissions to, or agency proceedings by, any Governmental
Authority, (iv) subject to applicable Law, shall promptly inform the other
party of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for
information from, such Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement and (v) subject to applicable Law,
shall consult with the other Parties in advance of any meeting or conference,
whether in person or by telephone, with any such Governmental Authority or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and to the extent permitted by such applicable Governmental Authority or
other Person, give the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. During the period from the date
hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms and the Closing,

--- 

    

Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not acquire or agree to acquire by merging
or consolidating with, or by purchasing a material portion of the assets of or
equity in, any Person if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to
delay, hinder or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section
5.3(c) as "outside counsel only."

  

(d)  Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing, each Party
shall notify the United States Department of State Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (the " _DDTC_ ") of the transactions contemplated hereby under
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations § 122.4 and of the intent to
transfer all open licenses or other export authorizations included in
the Assigned Assets. Each party shall cooperate and consult with each other
in connection with the making of such notifications, including providing
counsel for the other party the opportunity in advance to review the proposed
notification prior to submission and considering in good faith the views of
the other party in connection with the notifications. For the avoidance of
doubt, no such notification contemplated by this clause (d) shall serve as a
condition precedent to the Closing.

  

(e)  In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or
other proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person is commenced
which raises questions about the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties
agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such
claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding; provided, however,
that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require,
Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to litigate with or
otherwise participate in any Legal Proceeding with any Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining any approval pursuant to this
Agreement. In order to permit the satisfaction of the Closing condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ , Purchaser shall (and Purchaser shall permit the
Company, the Company Subsidiary and the Contributing Affiliate to) (i) agree
to (A) any sale, license, divestiture or other disposition or holding separate
of any capital stock, businesses, assets, properties or other interests of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective controlled Affiliates or (B)
the imposition of any limitation, restriction or condition on the ability of
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective controlled Affiliates to
conduct their respective businesses or own, acquire, hold or exercise full
rights of ownership of any capital stock, businesses, assets, properties or
other interests ((A) and (B), the " _Antitrust Actions_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (1) any such actions are conditioned upon and become effective
only from and after the Closing and (2) under no circumstances, shall
Purchaser be required to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect or agree to
Antitrust Actions or other related actions that materially and adversely
affect Purchaser and its Affiliates (including after the Closing the Company
and the Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole) or the Business. Subject to the
foregoing, in no event will Seller (and Seller will not permit any of its
Affiliates including the Company, the Company Subsidiary or the Contributing
Affiliate to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any Antitrust Actions
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor shall Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company, the Company Subsidiary and the
Contributing Affiliate) be required to propose, negotiate, effect or agree to,
any Antitrust Actions.

Section 5.4 _Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records_.

  

(a)  Except as otherwise agreed, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser will make or cause to be made available to Seller and its
representatives, all books, records and documents in its or its Affiliates'
possession (including, for purposes of this  _Section 5.4_ , Tax Returns and
personnel records or files related to Business Employees and Former Employees
(as such term is defined in the Asset Contribution Agreement)) of the
Company, the Company Subsidiary and, with respect to the Business,
the Contributing Affiliate (and the assistance of employees responsible for

reasonably necessary for: (i) investigating, settling, preparing for the
defense or prosecution of, defending or prosecuting any action, suit or
proceeding by or before any court or other Governmental Authority; (ii)
preparing reports to Government Authorities; (iii) preparing and delivering
any accounting or other statement provided for under this Agreement or
otherwise or (iv) preparing Tax Returns or responding to or disputing any Tax
inquiry, audit or assessment; _provided_ , _however_ , that access to such
books, records, documents and employees will not unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of the Company and Company Subsidiary and the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Company and Company Subsidiary
incurred by them in connection therewith will be paid by Seller; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that nothing herein shall require Purchaser to disclose
any information if such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client or
other legal privilege available to Purchaser or its Affiliates, contravene
any applicable Law or violate any confidentiality obligation to a third party
(it being understood that in such instances, Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a
manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described in this
proviso). Purchaser will cause the Company and the Company Subsidiary to
maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records and documents for
the greater of (A) seven (7) years after the Closing Date or (B) any
applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be
extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer such records to Seller at
the end of any such period.

  

(b)  Except as otherwise agreed, from and after the Closing,
Seller will make or cause to be made available to Purchaser and its
representatives, all books, records and documents in its possession
(including, for purposes of this _Section 5.4_ , Tax Returns) of the Company,
the Company Subsidiary and, with respect to the Business, the Contributing
Affiliate (and the assistance of employees responsible for such books,
records and documents) during normal business hours as may be reasonably
necessary for: (i) investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or
prosecution of, defending or prosecuting any action, suit or proceeding by or
before any court or other Governmental Authority; (ii) preparing reports to
Government Authorities; (iii) preparing and delivering any accounting or
other statement provided for under this Agreement or otherwise or (iv)
preparing Tax Returns or responding to or disputing any Tax inquiry, audit or
assessment; _provided_ , _however_ , that access to such books, records,
documents and employees will not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of Seller and its Affiliates and the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of Seller and its Affiliates incurred by them in connection
therewith will be paid by Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing
herein shall require Seller to disclose any information if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege available to
Seller or its Affiliates, contravene any applicable Law or violate any
confidentiality obligation to a third party (it being understood that in such
instances, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to provide
such information, in whole or in part,

    

41 
--- 

 


--- 

    

in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described in this
proviso). Seller will maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books,
records and documents for the greater of (A) seven (7) years after the Closing
Date or (B) any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the
same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer such records
to Purchaser at the end of any such period.

  

Section 5.5   _Public Announcements_. Each of Seller and Purchaser
shall issue an initial press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement each of which such press release shall be reasonably agreed upon by
the other Party. Unless required by applicable Law or Governmental Authority
(including disclosures advisable or required under applicable securities Laws
or the rules or regulations of any United States securities exchange or
listing agreement covering publicly traded securities), no press release or
other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be issued, released or generated by either Purchaser or
Seller (and each of Purchaser and Seller shall instruct its respective
representatives not to make any publicity concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) without the prior consent of the other Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If such disclosure is
required by applicable Law or Governmental Authority (including
disclosures advisable or required under applicable securities Laws or the
rules or regulations of any United States securities exchange or listing
agreement covering publicly traded securities), the Party seeking to make such
disclosure shall, before making such release or announcement, provide a copy
thereof to the other Party reasonably prior to such issuance. Neither Party
shall be required to provide notice to the other Party or otherwise comply
with this _Section 5.5_ to the extent any proposed release or announcement is
consistent with information that has previously been made public without
breach of the obligations under this _Section 5.5_.

  

Section 5.6   _Reorganization Transactions_. Seller shall carry
out, prior to the Closing Date, the Reorganization Transactions that are
required to occur prior to the Closing as described in Annex A.

  

Section 5.7   _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by
Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall bear all such Taxes, fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the Reorganization Transactions.

  

Section 5.8   _Tax Matters_.

  

(a)   _Liability for Taxes_.

  

(i)  Seller shall be liable for and pay (A) all Taxes imposed
on the Company or the Company Subsidiary pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6
or similar provision of state, local or foreign law solely as a result of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary having been a member of a Consolidated Tax
Group, (B) Taxes imposed on the Company or the Company Subsidiary for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing

    

42

--- 

    

Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, (C) any payments owed by the
Company or the Company Subsidiary under any Tax allocation, sharing or
indemnity agreements (other than any such agreements solely between the
Company and the Company Subsidiary or any such agreements entered into by the
Company or the Company Subsidiary after the Closing), (D) any Taxes imposed
on the Company or the Company Subsidiary in connection with the Reorganization
Transactions, and (E) any liability of the Company or the Company Subsidiary
for the payment of Taxes of a predecessor or any transferor or otherwise by
operation of a similar principle of Law in each case which relate to an event
or transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not
indemnify Purchaser from and against, (I) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes
were taken into account as a liability or reserve in calculating Final
Working Capital, (II) any Taxes that result from any actual or deemed
election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar provisions of state,
local or foreign law as a result of the purchase of the Shares or that result
from Purchaser, any Affiliate of Purchaser, the Company or the Company
Subsidiary engaging in any activity or transaction that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be treated as a purchase or
sale of assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiary for Tax purposes and
(III) any Taxes imposed on the Company or the Company Subsidiary as a result
of transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable
(based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth in Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing
(Taxes described in this proviso, hereinafter " _Excluded Taxes_ ").

  

(ii)  Purchaser and Seller agree that, with respect to any
transaction described in clause (III) of _Section 5.8(a)(i)_ , the Company
and all persons related to the Company under Section 267(b) of the Code
immediately after the Closing shall treat the transaction for all federal
income Tax purposes (in accordance with Treas. Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B))
and (to the extent permitted) for other income Tax purposes, as occurring at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date.

  

(iii)  Seller shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit
against) Taxes allocable to any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date. Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to take such steps as may be
reasonably available to secure any such refund or credit, including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns for any period that ends on or
before Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall inform Seller shortly after the end of each calendar year as to whether
any such refund or credit is, or with the taking of action would be,
available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to any
such refund of (or credit against) Taxes to the extent that such refund or
credit (a) was taken into account as an asset in calculating Final Working
Capital, (b) is used by Purchaser to offset any Taxes paid by Purchaser for
which Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 8.2 or (c) arose from the
carryback of losses, credits or other Tax attributes from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

    

43 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(iv)  Purchaser shall be liable for and pay (A) all Taxes imposed
on the Company or the Company Subsidiary for any taxable year or period that
begins after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date unless such
Taxes are described in clause (A), (C) or (D) of _Section 5.8(a)(i)_ and (B)
all Excluded Taxes.

  

(v)  For purposes of _Section 5.8(a)(i)-(iv)_ , whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary for the portion of a Straddle Period that ends on or before the
Closing Date, and the portion of a Straddle Period that begins after the
Closing Date, the determination shall be made by assuming that the Straddle
Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the
close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit of the Company or such Company Subsidiary for the Straddle Period
shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of
the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company or such Company
Subsidiary were closed at the close of the Closing Date, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (I) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are
properly allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth
in Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date
after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is
deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date (it
being understood that the Reorganization Transactions shall be allocated to a
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date irrespective of when
those transactions occur), and (II) exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as property Taxes and depreciation
deductions, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on
a daily basis.

  

(vi)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller and
Purchaser agree that Seller makes no representation, warranty, and provides
no other assurance, with respect to the amount of any Tax Attributes of the
Company or the Company Subsidiary, or with respect to the availability on and
after the Closing Date of any Tax Attributes of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary. Seller shall have no liability for any Taxes resulting from or
arising with respect to any sale of the Company or the Company Subsidiary (or
any assets thereof) following the Closing Date.

  

(b)   _Tax Returns_.

  

(i)  Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (x) all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or the
Company Subsidiary on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with Seller
or any Affiliate thereof (other than the Company or the Company Subsidiary)
and (y) all other income Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiary for taxable years or
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (z) all other Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or the
Company Subsidiary (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) on
or prior to the Closing Date. In each case Seller shall remit or cause to be
remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall timely
file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date
and Purchaser

    

44 
--- 

 


--- 

    

shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. The Tax Returns filed under this Section 5.8(b)(i) shall be prepared
and filed on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable periods
unless a different treatment of any item is required by Law.

  

(ii)  All Tax Returns that Purchaser is required to file or
cause to be filed in accordance with this _Section 5.8(b)_ that relate to any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle
Period shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice
and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method
adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods unless a
different treatment of any item is required by Law. With respect to any such
Tax Return to be filed by Purchaser, not less than 30 days prior to the due
date for such Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or, if such due date
is within 30 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date), Purchaser shall provide Seller with a draft copy
of such Tax Return for Seller's approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

(iii)  Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall (or
shall cause or permit the Company or the Company Subsidiary to) make or
change any Tax election, amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an
extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Company or the Company Subsidiary with
respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or
with respect to any Straddle Period, or take any other action that would
increase any Tax liability or reduce any Tax benefit in respect of any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date or any
Straddle Period, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

(iv)  Purchaser shall promptly cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiary to prepare and provide to Seller a package of Tax information
materials, including, without limitation, schedules and work papers (the "
_Tax Package_ ") required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare and file all
Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to _Section
5.8(b)(i)_. The Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with past
practice, including past practice as to providing such information and as to
the method of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure
of income of the Company. Purchaser shall cause the Tax Package to be
delivered to Seller within 60 days after the Closing Date.

  

(c)   _Contest Provisions_.

  

(i)  Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon
receipt by Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the
Company or the Company Subsidiary of notice of any pending or threatened
federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period or
relating to a Tax for which Seller may be liable pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ that no failure to give such notice shall relieve Seller of any
liability hereunder except to the extent, if any, that the rights of Seller
with respect to such claim are actually prejudiced.

    

45 
--- 

 


--- 

    

(ii)  Provided that Seller does not dispute its obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the asserted
liability, Seller shall have the sole right to represent the Company's and
the Company Subsidiary's interests in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date and to employ counsel of Seller's choice at Seller's expense; _provided_
, _however_ , that Seller shall consult with the Company regarding any such
audit or proceeding and inform the Company in a timely manner of any material
events concerning any such audit or proceeding, and Purchaser and its
representatives shall be permitted, at Purchaser's expense, to be present at,
and participate in, any such audit or proceeding. Subject to _Section
5.8(c)(iii)_ , neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect the liability
for Taxes relating to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date
or to any Straddle Period or relating to a Tax for which Seller would be
liable pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Seller shall have the
right to settle or dispose of the portion of any audit or proceeding relating
to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no settlement or other disposition of any claim for Tax
which would adversely affect any Purchaser Indemnified Party in any taxable
period in any manner or to any extent (including the imposition of income Tax
deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments and
the reduction of loss or credit carryovers) shall be agreed to without the
Company's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

  

(iii)  In the event of any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date,
including a Straddle Period, with respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may seek an indemnity from Seller under this _Section 5.8_ or
_Article 8_ , Seller and Purchaser shall jointly represent the Company's and
the Company's Subsidiary's interests in such audit or proceeding, shall
employ counsel of their mutual choice, and shall cooperate with the other and
the other's representatives in a prompt and timely manner in connection with
any such audit or proceeding. Seller shall have the right to settle or
dispose of the portion of any such audit or proceeding relating to any Tax for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek an indemnity from Seller
under this _Section 5.8_ or _Article 8_ ; provided, however, that no
settlement or other disposition of any claim for Tax which would adversely
affect any Purchaser Indemnified Party in any taxable period in any manner or
to any extent (including, but not limited to, the imposition of income tax
deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments and the
reduction of loss or credit carryovers) shall be agreed to without the
Company's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. In the event Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree
regarding any aspect of the conduct of any such audit or proceeding, the
decision shall be made by the counsel employed to pursue such audit or
proceeding on the basis of counsel's good faith judgment regarding the course
of action that would produce the overall lowest present value of Tax and
litigation cost to the Parties. Any expenses relating to any such audit
or proceeding shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in the same proportion
as such related Taxes are borne by Purchaser and Seller in accordance with
this _Article 5_ and _Article 8_.

    

46

--- 

    

(d)   _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, each
of Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to):

  

(i)  timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may
be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise
reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described
in _Section 5.7_ (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes);

  

(ii)  assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
_Section 5.8(b)_ , and in connection therewith, provide the other party with
any necessary powers of attorney;

  

(iii)  cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits
of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the
Company and the Company Subsidiary;

  

(iv)  make available to the other and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to
Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiary; and

  

(v)  furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or
information request relating to Taxes of the Company and the Company
Subsidiary.

  

Section 5.9   _Employee Matters_.

  

(a)  For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or such earlier date as a Business
Employee's employment with the Company Subsidiary and its Affiliates
terminates), Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause the Company Subsidiary
or one of their Affiliates to provide, the Business Employees with
substantially the same terms and conditions of employment, including a rate
of base salary, base wages or other base compensation, short-term bonus
opportunity (including any annual cash bonus opportunity, if applicable) and
aggregate employee benefits (excluding equity, equity-based or other long-
term incentive awards) that are, in each case, no less favorable than that as
in effect for each such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Upon
a return to active employment with Seller and its Affiliates by any Leave
Employee, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, offer
employment to such Leave Employee with substantially the same terms
and conditions of employment, including a rate of base salary, base wages or
other base compensation, short-term bonus opportunity (including any annual
cash bonus opportunity, if applicable) and aggregate employee benefits
(excluding equity, equity-based or other long-term incentive awards) that
are, in each case, no less favorable than that as in effect for such Leave
Employee immediately prior to such Leave Employee's date of termination with
Seller and its Affiliates. The offer of employment to a Leave Employee shall
provide for employment commencing as of the date that such Leave Employee
returns to active employment. Purchaser shall provide Seller with the
opportunity to review and comment upon such employment offers and consider in
good faith all such comments. Each Leave Employee who accepts an offer of
employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall be deemed to be a
Business Employee

for purposes of this _Section 5.9 _ (other than _Section 5.9(g)_ ) beginning
on his or her date of hire with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates.

  

(b)  Purchaser shall have, or shall cause the Company Subsidiary
or one of its Affiliates to have, in effect for a period of at least 12
months following the Closing Date a severance plan, practice or policy
applicable to each Business Employee that is not less favorable to the
Business Employee than the severance plan, practice or policy applicable to
the Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and set forth on
_Schedule 5.9(b)_ (with credit for service as set forth in _Section 5.9(e)_ ).

  

(c)  Effective as of the Closing Date, each Business Employee
and each Leave Employee shall become fully vested in his or her account
balance in the Company Retirement Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall have, or shall cause the Company Subsidiary or one of its
Affiliates to have, in effect a defined contribution plan that is qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Purchaser Retirement Plan_ ") in which Business Employees who meet the
eligibility criteria thereof shall be immediately eligible to participate.
Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchaser Retirement Plan to accept eligible
rollovers by Business Employees from the Company Retirement Plan except as
would reasonably be expected to cause the Purchaser Retirement Plan to cease
to be qualified or become subject to Taxes or other penalties.

  

(d)  Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company Subsidiary or
one of its Affiliates to, maintain Welfare Plans, including a group health
plan, in which Business Employees and their spouses, dependents or other
beneficiaries, who meet the eligibility criteria thereof, no later than
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date with respect to any Welfare Plan
which is a group health plan and no later than ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date with respect to all other Welfare Plans, may participate in
accordance with the terms thereof (the " _Purchaser Welfare Plans_ ").
Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall ensure that (i) no waiting
periods which exceed thirty (30) days or ninety (90) days, as applicable,
exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing conditions,
evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work exclusions are
applicable to any Business Employees covered by Welfare Plans maintained by
the Contributing Affiliate, the Company Subsidiary or their Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Seller Welfare Plans_ "), or
their spouses, dependents or other beneficiaries, under any similar Purchaser
Welfare Plans, except in all cases to the extent any such waiting period,
exclusion or limitation was applicable to and unsatisfied under the Seller
Welfare Plans, and (ii) any costs or expenses incurred by the Business
Employees (and their spouses, dependents and other beneficiaries) under the
Seller Welfare Plans with respect to the plan year that includes the Closing
Date, up to and including the Closing Date, shall be specifically applied for
purposes of satisfying any similar deductible, co-payment, coinsurance,
maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on
coverage under the Purchaser Welfare Plans for the plan year that includes
the Closing Date to the same extent as would have applied under such Seller
Welfare Plans. The Parties will reasonably cooperate in good faith prior to
the Closing Date to share information required for Purchaser to discharge its
obligations under this _Section 5.9(d)_ , and all Purchaser obligations under
this _Section 5.9(d)_ are subject to the receipt by Purchaser from Seller of
the relevant information necessary to effectuate this provision.

(e)  With respect to each employee benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement, including severance, vacation and paid time-off plans,
policies or practices, sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or an Affiliate of
Purchaser, Purchaser or such Affiliate shall recognize and grant, for all
Business Employees, credit for all service with Seller, the Contributing
Affiliate, the Company, the Company Subsidiary, their Affiliates and their
respective predecessors to the same extent recognized or granted by Seller and
its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting and, in respect of any severance, vacation and paid time-off plans,
level of benefits; _provided_ that no service credit shall be recognized or
granted to the extent any duplication of benefits results therefrom.

  

(f)  From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume
and honor in accordance with their terms, all employment,
retention, severance and termination plans, agreements or arrangements
(including change-in-control provisions) of Business Employees ("
_Retention Arrangements_ ") listed on _Schedule 5.9(f)_ (or shall cause its
Affiliates, including the Company and the Company Subsidiary, to retain and
honor all such Retention Arrangements) and shall pay to each Business Employee
any amounts that become payable to such Business Employee following the
Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the applicable Retention
Arrangement (including the "Retention Bonus Payment" (as such term is defined
in each respective Retention Arrangement)) (it being understood that such
Retention Arrangements that are assumed by Purchaser hereunder shall be
treated as an Assigned Plan and as a result, the Liabilities thereunder
(except as provided below with respect to the Divestiture Completion Bonus
Payment) shall be treated as Assumed Liabilities for purposes of this
Agreement); provided, however, that Seller shall be responsible for and cause
each "Divesture Completion Bonus Payment" (as such term is defined in each
respective Retention Arrangement) (it being understood that the Liabilities
related to such Divestiture Completion Bonus Payments shall be treated as
Excluded Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement) which is due and payable
under each such Retention Arrangement to be made. Purchaser shall obtain a
waiver and release of claims fully releasing all claims the applicable
Business Employee has or may have against Seller as well as Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates, subject to the limitations set forth in the
respective Retention Arrangement, and in a form customarily used by Purchaser
and its Affiliates, in connection with the payment of the Retention Bonus
Payment amounts to a terminated Business Employee, and shall take
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a similar waiver and release of
all claims against Seller, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates, in a
form customarily used by Purchaser and its Affiliates, in connection with the
payment of any other Retention Bonus Payment amounts.

  

(g)  Purchaser shall have in effect, or cause to be in effect,
as of the Closing Date, health care and dependent care flexible spending
reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of
the Code (the " _Purchaser Cafeteria Plan_ ") in which Business Employees who
meet the eligibility criteria thereof may immediately participate. As soon
as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be
transferred to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the excess of the
aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement
accounts under Seller's cafeteria plan in which such Business Employees
participate (the " _Seller Cafeteria Plan_ ") made during the year in which
the Closing Date occurs by the Business Employees over the aggregate
reimbursement payouts made for such year from such accounts to such Business
Employees. Purchaser or its Affiliate shall cause the balance of each Business
Employee's accounts under the Seller Cafeteria Plan as of the

    

49 
--- 

 


--- 

    

Closing Date to be credited to the Business Employee's corresponding accounts
under the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan in which such employee participates
following the Closing Date. Once the Business Employee account balances and
the Seller Cafeteria Plan records are actually transferred, but in no event
prior thereto, and on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and be
solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by the Business
Employees, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have
not been paid in full as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid
pursuant to and under the terms of the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan,
and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Contributing
Affiliate, the Company, the Company Subsidiary and their respective
Affiliates from any and all claims duly incurred by or with respect to the
Business Employees for reimbursement under the Seller Cafeteria Plan that
have not been paid in full as of the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to cause
the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan to honor, through the end of the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs, the elections made by each Business
Employee under the Seller Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Nothing in this _Section 5.9(g)_ shall cause liability to transfer to
Purchaser until Seller Cafeteria Plan account balances and corresponding
Seller Cafeteria Plan records which are necessary in order for Purchaser to
meet its obligations under this _Section 5.9(g)_ transfer to Purchaser.

  

(h)  No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights in any Business Employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or otherwise with Seller, Purchaser, the
Company, the Company Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates, and no
provision of this _Section 5.9_ shall create any such rights in any such
Persons hereunder or otherwise in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Employee Benefit Plans or any
other compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement which
may be maintained or contributed to by Seller, Purchaser, the Company, the
Company Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained in this
_Section 5.9_ shall constitute or be deemed to be the creation of or an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement of Seller, Purchaser, the Company,
the Company Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates.

  

Section 5.10   _Non-Solicitation and Non-Hire_. Without the prior
written consent of Seller, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall,
for a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, either directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire, employ or engage (either as a
consultant or employee) any Person who is or was an employee (including any
temporary or leased employees) of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Business Employees) on, or during the 60 days prior to, the Closing, that
Purchaser or its Affiliates meets in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement except that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be precluded
from placing any public advertisement or other form of generalized
solicitation not specifically directed to such employees or hiring any such
employee who responds to any such public advertisement. Without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall,
for a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, either directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire, employ or engage (either as a
consultant or employee) any Business Employee, except that Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be precluded from placing any public advertisement or
other form of generalized solicitation not specifically directed to such
employees or hiring any such employee who responds to any such public
advertisement.

Section 5.11  _Guarantees_. At or before the Closing, Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange (and Seller shall provide reasonable
cooperation to Purchaser in arranging) for substitute instruments to fully
replace and release Seller or its applicable Affiliate as issuer, guarantor,
credit support provider or account party with respect to (a) any letters of
credit, guarantees and other financial assurance obligations issued or entered
into by or on behalf of the Business (collectively, " _Guarantees_ ") set
forth on _Schedule 5.11_ and (b) any Guarantees issued in the ordinary course
in connection with the Business prior to the Closing and not set forth in
such list in respect of which Purchaser has provided its prior
written consent. To the extent Purchaser is unable to obtain a substitute or
replacement instrument, or to the extent the beneficiary or counterparty
under any such Guarantee does not accept any such substitute instrument,
Purchaser shall either (at Purchaser's discretion) (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, against, and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for, all
amounts paid, including costs or expenses, in connection with such
Guarantees, including Seller's and its Affiliates' expenses in maintaining
such Guarantees or (ii) at Closing issue or cause to be issued by a third
party reasonably acceptable to Seller, a letter of credit, guarantee or other
financial assurance obligation for the account and benefit of Seller or its
applicable Affiliates in an amount equal to Seller's and its Affiliates'
entire potential Liability pursuant to all Guarantees not able to be so
replaced in accordance with the foregoing sentence, in each case whether or
not any such Guarantee is drawn upon or required to be performed, and
Purchaser shall in any event, without duplication of amounts paid to Seller
pursuant to any indemnity, letter of credit, guarantee or other financial
assurance obligation, promptly reimburse Seller to the extent any Guarantee is
called upon and Seller or its Affiliates make any payment or are obligated to
reimburse the party issuing the Guarantee. Other than in cooperation with
Purchaser, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and provided
that Purchaser is in compliance with its obligations under this _Section
5.11_ , Seller and its Affiliates shall take no steps to replace, remove or
obtain the release of any Guarantee provided by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any third party on behalf thereof with respect to any Assigned
Assets or Assumed Liabilities.

  

Section 5.12   _Financial Statements_. Pursuant to and subject to
_Sections 5.2(a)_ and _5.2(b)_ , prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser such information and
cooperation and assistance as Purchaser shall reasonably request for
Purchaser to prepare the historical, annual and interim audited and unaudited
financial statements of the Business and the pro forma financial information
required to be filed pursuant to Item 9.01 of Form 8-K and in accordance with
the requirements thereof, in a Form 8-K amendment following the Closing,
including obtaining and providing such data and financial information with
respect to the Business in the possession of Seller or its Affiliates as
Purchaser shall reasonably request and afford Purchaser and its authorized
representatives such access to employees of Seller or its Affiliates with
knowledge of such data and financial information as Purchaser shall
reasonably request. Following the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to continue to provide to Purchaser such information and
cooperation and assistance as Purchaser shall reasonably request for
Purchaser to prepare such financial statements and pro forma financial
information, including affording Purchaser and its authorized representatives
such access to employees of Seller or its Affiliates whose employment did not
transfer to Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and who have
knowledge of the data and financial information with respect to the Business,
as Purchaser shall reasonably request, upon reasonable prior notice and
during normal business hours, and causing to be delivered a customary
representation letter

    

51

--- 

    

promptly following Purchaser's reasonable request therefor; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (A) nothing in this sentence shall require such information,
cooperation or assistance to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the normal operations of the Business or the other businesses or operations of
Seller or its Affiliates and (B) Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
required to incur any Liability in connection with providing such information,
cooperation or assistance for which Seller is not entitled to reimbursement
by Purchaser pursuant to the following sentence. Purchaser shall, promptly
upon the written request of Seller, reimburse Seller, for all reasonable out-
of-pocket costs that have been incurred by Seller (including those of its
representatives) in connection with providing Purchaser information and
cooperation and assistance as provided in this Section 5.12.

  

Section 5.13 _Receivables_. From and after the Closing, if either
Party receives any (a) funds intended for, or otherwise the property of, the
other Party, the receiving Party shall promptly (i) notify and (ii) forward
such funds to, the other Party or (b) purchase order, letter or other
document intended for, or otherwise the property of, the other Party, the
receiving Party shall promptly (i) notify and (ii) forward such document to,
the other Party. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right
and authority to collect for its own account all receivables that are included
in the Assigned Assets and to endorse with the name of Seller or any
applicable Affiliate of Seller any checks or drafts received with respect to
any such receivables.

  

Section 5.14   _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller
shall, and shall cause its respective controlled Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Contribution Agreements. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in the event that Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates discovers following the Closing that (a) (i) any
Assigned Asset was inadvertently not transferred and delivered to Purchaser
at the Closing, Seller shall promptly transfer and deliver, or shall cause to
be transferred, such Assigned Asset to Purchaser in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement or (ii) any Excluded Asset was inadvertently transferred to
Purchaser at the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly transfer, or shall cause to
be transferred, such Excluded Asset back to Seller, or (b) any Assumed
Liability was inadvertently not transferred to and assumed by Purchaser at the
Closing, Purchaser shall promptly assume such Assumed Liability or (ii) any
Excluded Liability was inadvertently assumed by Purchaser at the
Closing, Seller shall promptly assume such Excluded Liability, in all cases,
for no additional consideration.

  

Section 5.15   _Wind Down of Trademarks_. To the extent any names or
trademarks owned by Seller or its Affiliates were used in the Business
immediately prior to the Closing Date (other than the Assigned Trademarks (as
defined in the Intellectual Property Contribution Agreement)), Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to use such names and trademarks in a
commercially reasonable manner consistent with past use and practice, and
shall wind down the use of such names and trademarks promptly following
the Closing, but shall in any event cease any such use within three months of
the Closing Date.

hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, each of Seller and Purchaser shall notify the
other of (a) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) any
notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any of the Contribution Agreements; (c) any Legal Proceeding commenced or
threatened against such Person or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Contribution
Agreements; (d) the occurrence of any Effect which to Seller's knowledge or to
Purchaser's knowledge, as applicable, would reasonably be expected to result
in any of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ becoming incapable of being
satisfied or that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of, or the failure to deliver, any notice, and
the information or knowledge obtained by the other Party pursuant to this
_Section 5.16_ shall not (i) affect or be deemed to affect or modify any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Closing in
_Article 6_ or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of the
Parties hereunder, including pursuant to _Article 8_ , (ii) be deemed to
affect or modify a Party's reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the other Party in this Agreement, (iii) be
deemed to amend or supplement the Schedules or prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by either Party or
(iv) in the case of clause (d) above, give rise to a claim under _Section
8.2(c)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_ or constitute a failure to satisfy any condition
under _Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ , in each case, solely on the basis
of the failure to give such notice contemplated in this _Section 5.16_.

  



  

Section 5.17 _Balance Sheet_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
to be settled or cancelled the amount included under the category
"Intercompany Payables" reflected in the Balance Sheet, as the same may be
at the time of such settlement or cancellation.  For the avoidance of doubt,
such amount shall not be deemed to be an Assumed Liability or an Assigned
Asset.

on the other hand, set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by
Seller pursuant to _Section 6.2(c) _ or by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
6.3(c)_ shall survive the Closing and terminate and be of no further force and
effect on the date that is fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties of
Seller contained in _Section 3.1_ (Organization), _Section 3.2_
(Authorization), _Section 3.5_  (Capitalization; Subsidiaries) and _Section
3.17_ (Brokers) (collectively, the " _Seller Specified Reps_ ") shall survive

_Section 3.9_ (Taxes) and in _Section 3.12(b)-(e)_ (Employee Benefits) shall
survive until thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the applicable

"), shall survive indefinitely and (v) insofar as any bona fide good faith
written claim for indemnification for breach thereof made prior to such date
and delivered to the applicable party hereto, shall survive thereafter until
fully and finally resolved and, as only to the claim specified therein, such
applicable expiration shall not affect the rights to indemnification of the
party making such claim. Any written claim by an Indemnified Party (as defined
below) with respect to a breach of any covenant or other agreement in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered by a party pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_

the Company or Purchaser may be given at any time prior to the day that is
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date. All other covenants set forth
herein shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective terms.

_Seller Indemnified Party_ ") harmless from and against any and all Losses

arising from:

  

(a)  any breach of any representation or warranty as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date) made by Purchaser
pursuant to _Article 4,_ other than the Purchaser Specified Reps, or any
inaccuracy in the certificate to be delivered at Closing pursuant to _Section

(g)  the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of
Purchaser contemplated by _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.11_ , if any;

  

(h)  any Assumed Liability under any of the Contribution

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    

(i)  any Taxes for which Purchaser is liable pursuant to
_Section 5.7_ or _Section 5.8(a)_ ; and

  

(j)  except as expressly provided in _Section 8.2_ , any Loss
or Liability in connection with the ownership and operation of the Business,

Section 8.4   _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
rights to indemnification, except in relation to Taxes, pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3 _ are subject to the following
limitations:

  

(a)  The maximum aggregate Liability of Seller to all Purchaser
Indemnified Parties taken together for Losses for any claims for
indemnification (i) pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ shall be limited to
$28,050,000.00 (the " _Cap_ ") and (ii) pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ ,
_Section 8.2(c)_, _Section 8.2(d)_ , _Section 8.2(e)_ , _Section 8.2(f)_ ,
_Section 8.2(g)_ and _Section 8.2(k)_ , shall be limited to the Adjusted
Purchase Price; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Seller be
liable in the aggregate to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any claims
for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in an amount greater than the
Adjusted Purchase Price (except in the case of claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.2(h)_ , _Section 8.2(i)_ or _Section 8.2(j)_ );
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the limitations set forth in
clause (ii) in respect of _Sections 8.2(e)_ , _Section 8.2(f)_ and  _Section
8.2(g)_ limit Seller's indemnification obligation in respect of Excluded
Liabilities pursuant to _Section 8.2(i)_. In addition, Seller shall not be
liable for Losses for any claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_  and _Section 8.2(b)_ unless and to the extent that each individual
claim for indemnification made by the Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 8.2(b)_ is for an amount greater than $25,000
(the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") and, with respect to claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ , the total of all Losses for any such claims
for indemnification shall exceed $1,870,000.00 in the aggregate (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then only for the excess amount over the Deductible.

  

(b)  The maximum aggregate Liability of Purchaser to all Seller
Indemnified Parties taken together for Losses for any claims for
indemnification (i) pursuant to Section _8.3(a)_ shall be limited to the Cap
and (ii) pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ ,  _Section 8.3(c)_ , _Section 8.3(d)_
, _Section 8.3(e)_ , _Section 8.3(f)_ and _Section 8.3(g)_ shall be
limited to the Adjusted Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Purchaser be liable in the aggregate to the Seller Indemnified
Parties for any claims for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in an
amount greater than the Adjusted Purchase Price (except in the case of claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.3(h)_ , _Section 8.3(i)_ or
_Section 8.2(j)_ ); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
limitations set forth in clause (ii) in respect of _Sections 8.3(e)_ or
_Section 8.3(f)_ limit Purchaser's indemnification obligation in respect of
Assumed Liabilities pursuant to _Section 8.3(h)_. In addition, Purchaser
shall not be liable for Losses for any claims for indemnification pursuant
to  _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 8.3(b)_ unless and to the extent that each
individual claim for indemnification made by a Seller Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 8.3(b)_ is for an amount greater
than the De Minimis Amount and, with respect to claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ , the total of all Losses for any such claims
for indemnification shall exceed the Deductible, and then only for the excess
amount over the Deductible.

--- 

    

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this _Article 8_ to the
contrary, Seller shall have no obligation under this _Article 8_ to indemnify
any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss to the extent it (i)
was included in the Actual Working Capital or (ii) was the subject of a
dispute with respect to the Final Working Capital Closing Date Calculation
pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.3(b)_ but did not result in an adjustment
to the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_. Any such Loss
shall be disregarded for all purposes of indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 8_.

  

(d)  Recovery by any Indemnified Party of any Loss suffered or
incurred by such party as a result of any breach by any other party of any of
its obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to the actual damages
suffered or incurred by such party as a result of the breach by the breaching
party of its obligations hereunder. In furtherance of and without limiting the
foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any recovery under this
Agreement for (i) special, exemplary, punitive, consequential, incidental or
indirect damages and (ii) diminution in value or lost profits (including with
respect to any Losses on account of lost opportunities); provided, however,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in the case of clause (i) to any
such Losses (y) to the extent such Losses (other than punitive damages) were
reasonably foreseeable or (z) if any Indemnified Party is held liable to any
third party for such Losses.

  

(e)  Any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification
obligations under this _Article 8_ shall be paid without duplication, and in
no event shall any Indemnified Party be indemnified under different provisions
of this Agreement for the same Loss. The amount which an Indemnifying Party
is or may be required to pay to an Indemnified Party in respect of Losses for
which indemnification is provided under this Agreement will be reduced by any
amounts actually received (including amounts received under insurance) by or
on behalf of the Indemnified Party (after deducting therefrom the full amount
of any applicable premiums, deductibles, collection costs, premium
adjustments, retrospectively rated premiums or other Losses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery) and any Tax benefit actually realized in the taxable
year of such Loss for such Indemnified Party in each case, as a result of the
accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Losses (such amounts (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of the Losses incurred by it in procuring
such recovery) are collectively referred to herein as " _Indemnity Reduction
Amounts_ "); _provided_ , that no Indemnified Party shall be obligated to
make such an insurance claim related to any Loss for which it is seeking
indemnification or has obtained indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_.
If any Indemnified Party receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect
of a claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement after
the full amount of such claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or after
an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such claim and such
Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such
claim, then the Indemnified Party will promptly remit to the Indemnifying
Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore
paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, _less_  (ii) the
amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity
payment was made. An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be
obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with
respect thereto or have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, solely
by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, it being expressly
understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be
entitled to any

    

61 
--- 

 


--- 

    

benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof.
Each party hereto, as appropriate, will, or will cause each Indemnified Party
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue promptly any claims or
rights it may have against all third parties which would reduce the amount of
Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement.

  

(f)  In valuing a Loss, no adjustment shall be made as a result
of any multiple, increase factor, or any other premium over fair market
value, book or historical value which may have been paid by Purchaser for the
Shares whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had
been used by Purchaser at the time of, or in connection with, calculating or
preparing its bid, its proposed purchase price for the Shares or its final
purchase price for the Shares.

  

(g)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rights
and remedies of an Indemnified Party shall not be limited by the fact that
any Indemnified Party (i) had actual or constructive knowledge (regardless of
whether such knowledge was obtained through such Indemnified Party's own
investigation or through disclosure by the other Party, its Representatives or
any other Person) of any breach, event or circumstances, whether before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, or (ii)
waived (A) any breach of representation or compliance with any covenant or (B)
any condition to the Closing set forth in  _Article 6_.

  

(h)  For purposes (i) of determining whether a breach of
representation or warranty has occurred for the purposes of _Section 8.2_ and
_Section 8.3_ any qualification as to "Material Adverse Effect" contained in
_Article 3_ and  _Article 4_ (other than _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.7_ ) of
this Agreement shall be deemed to be replaced with "material and adverse to
the Business" and (ii) of calculating the amount of Losses related thereto,
any qualification as to materiality, "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification or standard contained in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_  of the
Agreement shall be disregarded (it being understood that the word Material in
the defined term "Material Contracts," the qualification as to "Material
Adverse Effect" contained in _Section 3.7_ and the qualification of the
word "material" in _Section 3.12(a)_ shall not be disregarded for any of such
purposes).

  

Section 8.5   _Indemnification Procedures; Third Party Claims_.

  

(a)  An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice of any matter which an Indemnified Party has determined
has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, within thirty (30) Business Days of such determination (a "
_Direct Claim_ "), stating in reasonable detail the factual basis for the
claim, and the amount of the indemnifiable Loss, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises (the " _Indemnity Notice_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give the Indemnity Notice shall not waive an Indemnified Party's
right to indemnification, unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party was materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's
failure to give notice. Any such Indemnity Notice need only specify such
information to the knowledge of the Indemnified Party as of the date of such
Indemnity Notice and shall not limit or prejudice any of the rights or
remedies of any Indemnified Party on the

    

62 
--- 

 


--- 

    

basis of any limitation on the information included in such Indemnity Notice
made based on advice of counsel to preserve the attorney client privilege. In
the event of a claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby brought by one party hereto
against another, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a party
has breached this Agreement, then such breaching party shall be liable for,
and shall pay, the reasonable legal fees, costs and expenses that the non-
breaching party has incurred in connection with such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or demand, including any appeal therefrom.

  

(b)  If any claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand is brought
by a Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") against an Indemnified Party, and if such party intends
to seek indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to this _Article 8_ ,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly following receipt of notice of
the assertion or commencement of such Third Party Claim notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing and in reasonable detail of the Third Party
Claim (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ") (including the factual basis for
the Third Party Claim, and, to the extent known, the amount of the Third
Party Claim); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent) the Indemnifying Party was materially prejudiced by the
Indemnified Party's failure to give notice; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that it
is understood and agreed that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party prior to the settlement of a Third Party Claim
(whether by paying a claim or executing a binding settlement agreement with
respect thereto) or the entry of a judgment or issuance of an award with
respect to a Third Party Claim shall constitute actual prejudice to the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against such Third Party Claim. Such
notice shall also (i) reasonably identify the basis under which
indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Article 8_ , (ii) if known,
identify the amount of the indemnifiable Loss and method of computation
thereof, and (iii) enclose true and correct copies of any written document
furnished to the Indemnified Party by the Person that instituted the Third
Party Claim. Any such Third Party Claim Notice need only specify such
information to the knowledge of the Indemnified Party as of the date of such
Third Party Claim Notice and shall not limit or prejudice any of the rights
or remedies of any Indemnified Party on the basis of any limitation on the
information included in such Third Party Claim Notice made based on advice of
counsel to preserve the attorney client privilege. Thereafter, subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received or
transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

  

(c)  The Indemnifying Party will have the right, by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Third Party Claim Notice, to participate in or to
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party) with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to control the defense of any Third Party Claim that
(i) seeks any injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or (ii) seeks monetary damages the amount of which would reasonably be
expected to exceed any applicable limitation on the amount of Losses for which
the Indemnifying Party is responsible hereunder. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall only be liable to

    

63 
--- 

 


--- 

    

the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof in the
circumstances described below. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will keep the other reasonably informed of all material
developments upon becoming aware thereof relating to or arising in connection
with such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party is conducting the
defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party, at its sole cost and
expense, may retain separate counsel, and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party will
control such defense; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, in the reasonable
opinion of outside counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (B) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for reasonable
fees and expenses of separate counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to control the defense of such Third Party
Claim (including by failing to timely notify the Indemnified Party in writing
of its election to control such defense in accordance with this Section
8.5(c)), the Indemnified Party may control the defense of such Third Party
Claim with counsel of its choosing, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel to the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified
Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto
as is reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party.

  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.5_ to the
contrary, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall,
without the written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned), settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment;
_provided_ that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim which (i) the Indemnifying
Party may recommend and which by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party
to pay the full amount of Losses in connection with such Third Party Claim,
(ii) unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party completely from all
Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, (iii) does not impose any
Liability (including equitable remedies) on the Indemnified Party and (iv)
does not involve a finding or admission of any wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of
any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not make any payment
toward a settlement of such claim, nor permit to be paid any monies as part of
a settlement, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such
payment (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld or
conditioned). Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any
Liability, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

(e)  In the event of payment in full by an Indemnifying Party
to any Indemnified Party in connection with any claim, such
Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the place of such
Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such
Indemnified Party may have any rights relating to such claim against any
claimant

    

64 
--- 

 


--- 

    

or plaintiff asserting such claim or against any other Person. Such
Indemnified Party will cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting
any subrogated rights.

  

(f)  If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of
this _Section 8.5_ and _Section 5.8(c)_ (relating to Tax contests), the
provisions of _Section 5.8(c)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

  

(g)  Purchaser and Seller agree to report each indemnification
payment made in respect of a Loss as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase
Price for federal income Tax purposes.

  

Section 8.6   _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section 2.3_ and
_Section 9.11_ , and except for claims based on fraud, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Closing occurs,
the remedies set forth in this _Article 8_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for the Parties hereto for any misrepresentation or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this
Agreement (other than _Section 5.2(b)_ ) or, except under the
Transition Services Agreement, in any certificate, agreement or document
delivered in connection herewith (including the Contribution Agreements) or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby (including with
respect to environmental, health or safety matters, including without
limitation those arising under CERCLA or any other Environmental Laws or any
other environmental matters). In no event shall Purchaser or Seller make any
setoff against amounts otherwise due to the other Party or any of its
Affiliates by reason of any claim either may have against the other Party
under this Agreement.

  

Section 8.7   _Mitigation_. Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall
cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or Liability
with respect to which one party hereto is obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or
resolve any such claim or Liability.

  

Article 9 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  

Section 9.1   _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and

proceedings commenced in connection with or relating to this Agreement, shall
be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of New York without regard of the Laws that might otherwise govern
under the applicable principles of conflict of laws of the State of New York.

  

Section 9.4   _Construction; Interpretation_. The name assigned to
this Agreement and the article and section captions used herein are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or
construction hereof. Whenever the context requires, the gender of all words
used in this Agreement includes the masculine, feminine, and neuter. Unless
otherwise specified, all references to Articles and Sections refer to
articles and sections of this Agreement. Where any provision in this
Agreement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is
prohibited from taking, such provision will be applicable whether such action
is taken directly or indirectly by such Person, including actions taken by or
on behalf of any controlled Affiliate of such Person. All accounting terms
used herein and not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings accorded
them in accordance with GAAP, as applied in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, and, except as expressly provided herein, all accounting
determinations will be made in accordance with such accounting principles in
effect from time to time. Unless the context otherwise requires, a reference
to a document includes all amendments or supplements to, or replacements or
novations of, that document. In this Agreement, (a) the use of the term
"including" means "including, without limitation"; (b) the word "or" shall be
disjunctive but not exclusive; (c) a reference to a statute, regulation,
proclamation, ordinance or by-law includes all statutes, regulations,
proclamations, ordinances or by-laws amending, consolidating or replacing it,

apply equally to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. The
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party hereto. If an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision.

  

Section 9.5   _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibit, the Annexes
and Schedules hereto, and all documents expressly incorporated into this
Agreement, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a
part hereof as if set out in full in this Agreement. Disclosure of any item
in any Schedule referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to each other section in this
Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other section is
reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the omission of a reference
or cross-reference thereto. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedules is intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts of the items so included or other
item, are or are not material or that such fact or matter would with any
other fact or matter have a Material Adverse Effect, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material or would with
any other fact or matter have a Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this
Agreement. No disclosure in the Schedules to the Agreement relating to any
possible, potential or alleged breach or violation of any Law or Contract
shall be construed as an admission that any such breach or violation exists
or has actually occurred. In disclosing the information in the Schedules, the
Company expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege associated
with such information or any protection afforded by the work-product
doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed herein.
References in the Schedules to any agreement include references to such
agreement's exhibits and schedules.

  

Section 9.6   _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its
successors and permitted assigns and, except as provided in _Article 8_ ,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.7   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

  

Section 9.8   _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement
may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all of which

    

68 
--- 

 


--- 

    

shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or scanned
pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to
this Agreement.

  

Section 9.9   _Knowledge of Seller_. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the phrase "to Seller's knowledge" and "known by Seller" and any
derivations thereof shall mean as of the applicable date, the actual knowledge
without independent investigation (and shall in no event encompass
constructive, imputed or similar concepts of knowledge) of the
individuals set forth on _Schedule 9.9_ , none of whom shall have any
personal Liability or obligations regarding such knowledge.

  

Section 9.10   _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each party agrees to submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York state courts or the federal courts
of the United State of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any
appellate court from any thereof, for the purpose of any legal action or
proceeding against a party hereto with respect to the subject matter of, or
related to, this Agreement. Each party irrevocably waives any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought as provided in this
subsection, and further irrevocably waives any claim that any such legal
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. To the extent a party has or may later acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process with respect to
itself or its property, such party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity
under this subsection. Each party to this Agreement agrees that service of
process shall be made in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in
_Section 9.2_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 9.10_.

  

Section 9.11   _Remedies_. Seller acknowledges that the transactions
contemplated hereunder are unique and that Purchaser shall be irreparably
injured should such transactions not be consummated in a timely fashion.
Consequently, Purchaser shall not have an adequate remedy at Law if Seller
shall fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder when required
to do so hereunder. In such event, Purchaser shall have the right, in
addition to any other remedy available in equity or Law, to specific
performance of such obligation by Seller, subject to: (a) Purchaser's
performance of its obligations hereunder; and (b) satisfaction by Purchaser
of the other terms and conditions hereof. Purchaser acknowledges that the
transactions contemplated hereunder are unique and that Seller shall be
irreparably injured should such transactions not be consummated in a timely
fashion. Consequently, Seller will not have an adequate remedy at Law if
Purchaser shall fail to consummate the transactions

contemplated hereunder, including with respect to the payment of the Initial
Purchase Price, when required to do so hereunder. In such event, Seller shall
have the right, in addition to any other remedy available in equity or Law, to
specific performance of such obligation by Purchaser, subject to Seller's
performance of its obligations hereunder and the other terms and conditions
hereof.

  

Section 9.12   _Further Assurances_. In connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto shall execute and
deliver any additional documents and instruments that may be necessary or
appropriate to effectuate and perform the provisions of this Agreement and
such transactions.

  

Section 9.13   _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay
on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

  

Section 9.14   _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by
the Parties hereto.

  

Section 9.15   _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly required by
this Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees,
costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are incurred in connection
with or by virtue of the negotiation, preparation and review of this
Agreement (including the Schedules) and all agreements, certificates, opinions
and other instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in
