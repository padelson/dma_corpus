AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF  MERGER

 

 

This  Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and  entered
into as of January 10, 2008 by and among AmCOMP Incorporated, a Delaware 
corporation (the "Company"), Employers Holdings,  Inc., a Nevada corporation
("Parent"), and Sapphire  Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent  ("Merger  Sub"). Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company are sometimes  referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively 
as the  "Parties."

 

 

WITNESSETH:

 

 

 

A. The  Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each deem
it advisable  that Parent acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to
the conditions  provided for in this Agreement.

 

 

 

B. In  furtherance thereof, it is proposed that the acquisition be
accomplished by  means of the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the "Merger"), with the Company  continuing as the surviving corporation in
the Merger, as a result of which  each  issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  "Common Stock"), of the 
Company (the shares of Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the
"Shares") will automatically  be  converted into the right to receive $12.50
per Share in cash, without interest,  upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this  Agreement.

 

 

 

C. The  Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has unanimously 
approved (with any interested directors abstaining from voting) this
Agreement  and the Merger, and such approval is sufficient to render
inapplicable to this  Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and
agreements contemplated  by  this Agreement (including the Voting
Agreements) the restriction against the  parties hereto and thereto engaging
in any business combination as set forth  in  Section 203 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the Board has 
determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company 
and  its stockholders, and has resolved to recommend that its stockholders
adopt  this  Agreement.

 

 

 

D. The  Board of Directors of Parent (on its own behalf and as the sole
stockholder  of  Merger Sub) and the respective Boards of Directors of
Merger Sub and the Company  have each approved this Agreement and the Merger.

 

 

 

E. Concurrently  with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement  to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent  and Merger Sub are entering into Voting
Agreements with certain stockholders  of  the Company (each,  a  "Voting
Agreement")  pursuant to which each of those stockholders has agreed, upon
the terms and  subject to the conditions set forth therein, to vote all
Shares beneficially  owned by such stockholders in accordance with the terms
of such Voting  Agreements.

as the surviving  corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"),
shall  continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Delaware as  a  wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. It is intended that the

entitled to the  benefit thereof, of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof (other than  those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but  subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions
at the Closing), the  closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take

(c) From  and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in  Section 259 of the DGCL and, except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein,  the  Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties,
rights, privileges, powers  and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and
all of the claims,  obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall  become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and
duties of the Surviving  Corporation.

1.3

    |  

Conversion  of  Securities.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

At  the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part  of  the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of
Merger Sub or the  Company:

 

 

(a) Each  Share that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
wholly  owned  subsidiary of Parent, or that is owned by the Company as
treasury stock, in  each  case immediately before the Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled  and  retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be  delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(A) Each  Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other  than  Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.3(a)
hereof and Dissenting  Shares (as defined in Section 1.6)) shall
automatically be converted into the  right to receive $12.50 in cash (the
"Merger Consideration"),  payable, without interest, to the holder of such
Share upon surrender, in the  manner provided in Section 1.4 hereof, of the
certificate that formerly  evidenced such Share. All such Shares shall, by
virtue of the Merger  and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, be automatically  cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate  representing any such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect  thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest  thereon, upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section  1.4  hereof.

 

 

(b) Each  issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of  Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and  non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the  Surviving Corporation, and all such shares shall constitute the only
outstanding  shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective  Time. From and after the Effective Time, any certificate
representing  the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent  that number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which  such shares of common stock of Merger Sub represented
thereby were converted  in  accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

1.4

    |  

Tender  of and Payment  for Certificates.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) Paying  Agent; Deposit of  Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall  designate a paying agent (the "Paying Agent") reasonably 
acceptable to the Company for the payment of the Merger  Consideration. No
later than the Effective Time, Parent shall  deposit, or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent for the benefit of  holders of Shares and
Company Options, cash constituting an amount equal to  (i)  the sum of the
Total Merger Consideration plus (ii) the Total Cash Amount (as  defined in
Section 1.5)  (such sum, the "Aggregate  Consideration," and such Aggregate
Consideration as deposited with the  Paying Agent, the "Exchange  Fund").
The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be  (i) held for the
benefit of the holders of Shares and Company Options and (ii)  applied
promptly to making the payments pursuant to Section 1.3(b)  hereof. Such
aggregate Merger Consideration shall be invested by the  Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. For purposes of this Agreement,  "Total Merger 
Consideration" means the product of (x) the number of Shares issued and 
outstanding (other than those shares retired pursuant to Section 1.3(a)
hereof  and Dissenting Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by  (y)  the Merger Consideration.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Exchange  Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the 
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (i) to each
holder  of  record, as of the Effective Time, of a certificate or
certificates, which  immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the  "Certificates"), which  Shares were converted
pursuant to Section 1.3(b) hereof into the right to  receive the Merger
Consideration, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall  specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Shares shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits  of loss
in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and  have 
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (y) instructions 
for  use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger  Consideration and (ii) to each holder of a Company Option, a check in
an amount  due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof in
respect of  such  Company Option. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss  in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a letter  of  transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed in accordance with the  instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required  pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled  to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly  represented by such
Certificate, to be mailed promptly following the Paying  Agent\'s receipt of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof),  and  the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No  interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates  on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates,  or  in
respect of Company Options. If payment of the Merger Consideration  is to be
made to a Person (as defined in Section 8.7) other than the Person  in 
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition  of  payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall  be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such  payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes
(as defined in Section  2.17) required by reason of the issuance to a Person
other than the registered  holder of the Certificate surrendered or such
Person shall have established  to  the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been  paid  or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.4,  each Certificate shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to  represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for each Share  in  cash as contemplated by
Section 1.3(b) hereof, without interest  thereon. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon
compliance with such reasonable terms  and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange  thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices.

 

 

(c) Transfer  Books; No Further  Ownership Rights in the Shares. At the
Effective Time, the  stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall  be  no further registration of transfers of Shares
on the records of the Company  or  the Surviving Corporation. From and after
the Effective Time, the  holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the
Shares outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with  respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable  Law (as defined in Section 2.6). If, after the
Effective Time,  Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they  shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration, as provided  for  in Section 1.3(b) hereof, for each Share
formerly represented by such  Certificates.

(d) Termination  of Exchange  Fund; No Liability. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund  (including any interest received with respect thereto) that
remains  undistributed to the holders of Shares or Company Options following
the  six-month anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving  Corporation upon demand, and any holders who have not theretofore
complied  with  this Article I shall thereafter be entitled to look only to
the Surviving  Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws)  only  as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration, payable  upon due surrender of their Certificates without any
interest  thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger
Sub,  the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable  to  any Person in respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund
delivered to a  public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or  similar Law. If any Certificates or Company Options
shall not have  been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time
(or immediately  prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of
such Certificate  or  Company Option would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any  Governmental Authority), any such cash in respect of
such Certificate or Company  Option shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property  of  Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously  entitled thereto.

 

 

(e) Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed  Certificates. In the event any
Certificate(s) shall have been  lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by  the  Person claiming such Certificate(s) to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if  required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such sum as Parent  may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against  any Party hereto or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such  Certificate(s), the Paying Agent will
disburse the Merger Consideration pursuant  to Section 1.3(b) payable in
respect of the Shares represented by such lost,  stolen or destroyed
Certificate(s).

 

 

(f) Withholding  Taxes. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled  to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from  the Merger Consideration payable to a holder of Shares
pursuant to the Merger  any such amounts as are required under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended (the "Code"), or  any applicable provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the  extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,  or  caused to be withheld
by the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be  treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder  of  the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by  Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may  be.

1.5

    |  

Options.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) As  of the Effective Time, all outstanding options to purchase Shares
(the "Company Options") granted  under the Company\'s 1996 Stock Option Plan,
Amended and Restated Directors\'  Stock Option Plan, 2005 Stock Option Plan
or those certain stock option  agreements between the Company and those
individuals listed on Section 1.5(a) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Company Option Plans"),  whether or not then vested,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth below  in this Section 1.5(a),
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action  on  the part of any
holder of any Company Option, become fully vested and converted  into the
right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following  the 
Effective Time, the net amount of (A) the product of (i) the excess,  if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such 
Company Option at the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares  subject to such Company Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings
for Taxes  (such net amount, the "Cash  Amount," and the aggregate of all
such Cash Amounts, the "Total Cash  Amount"). If the exercise price per share
of any Company  Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash
Amount therefor  shall be zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to any  Person subject to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as  amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the  "Exchange Act"), the  Cash Amount, if any, to be paid to
such Person in accordance with this Section  1.5(a) shall be paid as soon as
practicable after the payment can be made  without liability to such Person
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange  Act.

(b) As  of the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 1.5, all
rights under  any Company Option and any provision of the Company Option
Plans and any other  plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance
or grant of any other  interest in respect of the capital stock of the
Company shall be canceled,  shall  no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder  of a Company Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except  the right to receive a
Cash Payment, if applicable. The Company shall  take all such actions as are
necessary to ensure that, as of and after the  Effective Time, except as
provided in this Section 1.5, no Person shall have  any  right under the
Company Option Plans or any other plan, program, agreement  or  arrangement
with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation  or any
subsidiary thereof.

 

 

(c) At  or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected
any  necessary amendments to the Company Option Plans and any other
resolutions,  consents or notices, in such form reasonably acceptable to
Parent, required  under the Company Option Plans or any Company Options to
give effect to the  foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5.

Dissenting  Shares.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that holders  of  Shares are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, Shares  issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time with respect  to  which the holder thereof has properly
exercised and perfected the right to  dissent from the Merger and to be paid
fair value in accordance with Section  262  of the DGCL and as to which, as
of the Effective Time, the  holder thereof has not failed to timely perfect
or shall have not effectively  withdrawn or lost dissenters\' rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not  be converted
into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration  into  which
Shares are converted pursuant to Section 1.3(b) hereof, but the holder 
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the  DGCL.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if any  holder of Shares
who demands dissenters\' rights with respect to its Shares  under  the DGCL
effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or  otherwise) its
dissenters\' rights, then as of the Effective Time or the  occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holder\'s Shares shall  thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the  right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.3(b) hereof, 
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates 
formerly representing such Shares, and such Shares shall no longer be
Dissenting  Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall  cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided in  Section 262 of Delaware Law and as provided in this Section 1.6.
The  Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any notice of
intent  to  demand fair value for any Shares, withdrawals of such notices,
and any other  instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and (ii)  the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to  demands for fair value of Shares under the DGCL. The Company
shall  not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any  payment with respect to any demands for fair value of Shares or offer to
settle  or settle any such demands.

Certificate of  Incorporation (as defined in Section 2.1) shall be amended
and restated in  its  entirety to read as the certificate of incorporation
of Merger Sub in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time, except in

---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Each  of  the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of  its  organization and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease  and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being  conducted. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is duly  qualified or licensed and in good standing to do
business in each jurisdiction  in which the character of the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the  nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing  necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and  in  good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in  the  aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has  heretofore made available to Parent accurate
and complete copies of the  Company\'s Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation")  and its Amended and
Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") and the equivalent  organizational documents
of each of the Company Subsidiaries, each as currently  in effect. None of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in  violation of any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws  or  its equivalent
organizational documents.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse  Effect"
shall mean any occurrence, state of facts, change, event, effect  or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, (a) has, or would 
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the assets, 
liabilities, business, results of operations or financial condition of the 
Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any 
occurrence, state of facts, change, event, effect or circumstance to the
extent  resulting from (i) changes in general economic conditions or
financial, banking  or securities markets in general; (ii) changes in the
workers\' compensation  insurance industry generally; (iii) any changes in
statutes, rules, or  regulations applicable to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of their  respective properties or assets; (iv) any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities  or war (whether declared or not
declared) or any act of terrorism whether or  not  pursuant to the
declaration of a national emergency or war; (v) the announcement  of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the  Merger);
(vi) changes in United States of America generally accepted accounting 
principles ("GAAP") or  statutory accounting principles ("SAP") or any
authoritative  interpretation thereof promulgated after the date hereof by
the Financial  Accounting Standards Board or the National Association of
Insurance  Commissioners, respectively; (vii) the availability or cost of
financing to  Parent or Merger Sub (for the avoidance of doubt, the exception
in this clause  (vii) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination
that the underlying  cause of such unavailability or cost constitutes a
Company Material Adverse  Effect); or (ix) changes in loss reserves
occasioned by the report of the  Company\'s independent actuary as at
December 31, 2007, if such changes, when  aggregated with other changes in
loss reserves for the fiscal year 2007, are  not  less favorable than
changes in loss reserves for the fiscal year 2006, in the  aggregate;
provided, however,  that the  exceptions set forth in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (vi) shall not be given  effect to the extent that such occurrence,
state of facts, change, event, effect  or circumstance has a disproportionate
adverse effect on the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole
as compared to the effect on other Persons  operating in the industry
generally, or (b) would, or would reasonably be  expected to, prevent or
materially delay or impair the ability of the Company  or  the Company
Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement.

complete and correct list of all  Company Subsidiaries and their respective
jurisdictions of  organization. Each Company Subsidiary is wholly owned,

Schedule. All of the  outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests in each of the  Company Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and  non-assessable and were issued free of preemptive
rights and in compliance  with  applicable Laws. No equity securities or
other equity interests of  any of the Company Subsidiaries are or may become
required to be issued or  purchased by reason of any options, warrants,

whatsoever relating to, or securities  or  rights convertible into or

interests in, any Company Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, 
commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any Company Subsidiary 
is  bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or other equity
interests,  or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any
additional shares  of  its capital stock or other equity interests or
securities convertible into  or  exchangeable for such shares or interests.

stock or other equity or  voting interests in (including any securities

other  equity or voting interests in) any other Person, other than capital
stock of  the  Company Subsidiaries owned by the Company or another
Company  Subsidiary.

the Company  Subsidiaries. Section 2.3(b) of the  Company Disclosure

conducting insurance operations and all jurisdictions in which each  such
Company Subsidiary is licensed to write insurance  business. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or has  been since January 1, 2005

organization or is or since January  1, 2005 otherwise has been treated as
domiciled in a jurisdiction other than  its  jurisdiction of organization.

licensed or authorized as an insurance company  in its state of organization,

jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or  authorized and (iii)

applicable jurisdiction to write each line of business reported  as  being

the Company Permits of such Company Subsidiaries  conducting insurance
operations are in full force and effect and there is no  proceeding or, to
the knowledge of the Company, investigation to which the  Company or any
Company Subsidiary is subject before a Governmental Authority  that is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that would 
reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, amendment, failure to
renew,  limitation, suspension or restriction of any such Company  Permits.

(e) As  used herein, the term "Company  SAP Statements" means the statutory
statements of each of the Company  Subsidiaries as filed with the Florida
Office of Insurance Regulation for the  years ended December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2006 and the quarterly period  ended September 30, 2007 and any

Statements. Each of the Company Subsidiaries has  filed or submitted, or will
file or submit, all Company SAP Statements required  to be filed with or
submitted to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation  on  forms
prescribed or permitted by the Florida Office of Insurance  Regulation. The
Company SAP Statements were, and any Company SAP  Statements filed after the
date hereof will be, prepared in all material  respects in conformity with
SAP consistently applied for the periods covered  thereby (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto), and the Company  SAP  Statements present,
and any Company SAP Statements filed after the date hereof  will  present,
in all material respects the statutory financial position of such  Company
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the results of 
operations of such Company Subsidiaries for the respective periods then 
ended. The Company SAP Statements complied, and the Company SAP  Statements
filed after the date hereof will comply, in all material respects  with all
applicable Laws when filed, and no deficiency has been asserted with  respect
to any Company SAP Statements filed prior to the date hereof by the  Florida
Office of Insurance Regulation or any other Governmental  Authority. The
annual statutory balance sheets and income statements  included in the
Company SAP Statements as of the date hereof have been, where  required by
applicable Law, audited by an independent accounting firm of  recognized
national or international reputation, and the Company has made  available to
Parent true and complete copies of all audit opinions related  thereto.
Except as indicated therein, all assets that are reflected  as admitted
assets on the Company SAP Statements comply in all material respects  with
all applicable Laws. There are no permitted practices utilized  by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in the preparation of the Company  SAP 
Statements.

 

 

(f) The  policy reserves and other actuarial amounts carried on the Company
SAP  Statements of each Company Subsidiary, as of the respective dates of
such  Company SAP Statements, (i) were in compliance in all material respects
with  the  requirements for reserves established by the Florida Office of
Insurance  Regulation, (ii) have been computed in all material respects in
accordance  with  the requirements for reserves established by the Florida
Office of Insurance  Regulation, (iii) were determined in all material
respects in accordance with  generally accepted actuarial principles in
effect at such time, consistently  applied and prepared in accordance with
applicable SAP, (iv) were computed  on  the basis of methodologies
consistent in all material respects with those used  in computing the
corresponding reserves in prior fiscal years, except as  otherwise noted in
the Company SAP Statements, (v) have been computed on the  basis of
assumptions consistent with those used to compute the corresponding  items in
such financial statements, (vi) were fairly stated in all material  respects
in accordance with sound actuarial principles, and (vii) include  provisions
for all actuarial reserves and related items which ought to be  established
in accordance with applicable Laws and in accordance, in all  material
respects, with prudent insurance practices generally followed in the 
insurance industry. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no  facts or
circumstances that could reasonably necessitate any material change  in 
such reserves above those reflected in the Company SAP Statements (other
than  increases consistent with past experience resulting from the ordinary
course  of  business).

Intellectual  Property.

the  knowledge of the Company, by any trusts created thereunder, any trustee
or  administrator thereof or any other Person, with respect to any Company
Employee  Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in
accordance  with its terms and in material compliance with the requirements
prescribed  by  any and all applicable Laws (including ERISA and the Code),
and the Company  and  each ERISA Affiliate have performed all obligations
required to be performed  by  them under, are not in any respect in default
under or violation of, and have  no  knowledge of any default or violation
by any other party to, any of the Company  Employee Plans. All contributions
and premiums required to be made by  the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to
any Company Employee Plan have been made  on or before their due dates,
including any legally permitted  extensions. No Action has been brought, or
to the knowledge of the  Company is threatened, against or with respect to
any such Company Employee  Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS,
United States Department of  Labor (the "DOL"), the  SEC or other
Governmental Authority, other than routine claims for  benefits. To the
knowledge of the Company, each Company Employee Plan  that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan"  within  the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
and any awards thereunder, in each  case  that is subject to Section 409A of
the Code, has been operated in good faith  compliance, in all material
respects, with Section 409A of the Code since  January 1, 2005.

(c) Agents  and  Producers. To the knowledge of the Company, no Person 
performing the duties of insurance producer, reinsurance intermediary,
agency,  agent, managing general agent, wholesaler or broker with respect to
the Company  or any of the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company
Producers")  individually accounting for 2% or more of the total gross

has indicated to  the  Company or any Company Subsidiary that such Company
Producer will be unable  or  unwilling to continue its relationship as a

months after the date hereof. To the  knowledge of the Company, at the time
any Company Producer wrote, sold, or  produced business, or performed such
other act for or on behalf of the Company  or any Company Subsidiary that may
require a license under applicable Insurance  Laws, such Company Producer was
duly licensed and appointed as required by  applicable Insurance Law, in the
particular jurisdiction in which such Company  Producer wrote, sold,
produced, solicited, or serviced such business, and each  of the agency
agreements and appointments between the Company Producers,  including as
subagents under the Company\'s affiliated insurance agency, and  the 
Company and any Company Subsidiary, is valid, binding and in full force and 
effect in accordance with its terms. To the knowledge of the Company,  no
Company Producer has been since January 1, 2006,  or  is currently, in
violation (or with or without notice or lapse of time or both,  would be in
violation) of any term or provision of any Law applicable to the  writing,
sale or production of insurance or other business of the Company or  any 
Company Subsidiary. The contracts and other agreements pursuant to  which
Company Producers act on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary  are
valid, binding and in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,

thereunder in any material respect. The Company has made available to  Parent

material existing rights, obligations or liabilities  (the "Company
Reinsurance  Agreements"). Copies of all Company Reinsurance Agreements 
that are in effect on the date of this Agreement have been made available to 
Parent. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the 
knowledge of the Company, any other party to a reinsurance treaty, binder or 
other agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, 
is in  default in any material respect as to any provision thereof. The 
Company has no knowledge that the financial condition of any party to any 
Company Reinsurance Agreement is impaired to the extent that a default 
thereunder may be reasonably anticipated. Except as disclosed in Section
2.26(d)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company Subsidiaries are
entitled under  applicable Law to take full credit on the applicable Company
SAP Statement  with  respect to any Company Reinsurance Agreement pursuant
to which such subsidiary  has ceded reinsurance. Except as set forth in
Section 2.26(d) of  the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary  have received any notice from any party to any

Agreements.

under any circumstances reduce,  limit, mitigate or otherwise affect any
actual or potential loss to the parties  under any such Company Reinsurance
Agreement, other than inuring contracts  that  are explicitly defined in any
such Company Reinsurance Agreement, (ii) for  each  such Company Reinsurance
Agreement under which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary has or may have
recoverables, and for which risk transfer is not  reasonably considered to be
self-evident, documentation concerning the economic  intent of the
transaction and the risk transfer analysis evidencing the proper  accounting
treatment, as required by Statement of Statutory Accounting  Principles No.
62 ("SSAP No.  62"), is available for review by the domiciliary state
insurance  departments for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (iii)
each of the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries complies and has complied

supplements  and  modifications thereto (the "Company Actuarial 
Analyses"). There have been no actuarial reports of a similar  nature
covering any of the entities referred to in those reports in respect  of 
any period subsequent to the latest period covered in such actuarial 
reports. To the knowledge of the Company, the information and data  furnished
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to its independent actuaries  in
connection with the preparation of any Company Actuarial Analysis was 
accurate in all material respects for the periods covered in such  reports.
Each Company Actuarial Analysis was based upon an accurate  inventory of
policies in force for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,  as  the
case may be, at the relevant time of preparation and was prepared in 
conformity with generally accepted actuarial principles in effect at such
time,  consistently applied (except as may be noted therein).

 

 

(g) Policy  Dividends. Except as set forth in Section 2.26(g) of  the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no insurance policies issued, 
reinsured or assumed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that 
are  currently in force under which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries  may be required to pay dividends to the holders thereof.

(a) Between  the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
will give, and  shall direct its accountants and legal counsel to give,
Parent (and its  officers, directors, employees, accountants, actuaries,
legal counsel, financial  advisors, financing sources, agents and other
representatives, collectively,  "Parent  Representatives"), at reasonable
times and upon reasonable intervals and  notice and following advance
consultation with the Company\'s Chief Executive  Officer or Chief Operating
Officer, access to all offices and other facilities  and to all employees,
properties, contracts, agreements, commitments, books  and  records of or
pertaining to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including  Tax
Returns, internal work papers, client files, client contracts and director 
service agreements) and such financial and operating data and other
information,  all of the foregoing as Parent or the Parent Representatives
may reasonably  request regarding the business, assets, liabilities,
employees and other aspects  of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(including providing Parent and  the  Parent Representatives with unaudited
quarterly financial statements, including  a consolidated quarterly balance
sheet and income statement, in the form such  financial statements have been
delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof,  of  the Company and providing
Parent and the Parent Representatives with the  financial results of the
Company in advance of any filing by the Company with  the SEC containing such
financial results) and instruct the officers, directors,  employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel and financial advisors of  the 
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent and the Parent 
Representatives in their investigation of the Company and the Company 
Subsidiaries (including by reading available independent public
accountant\'s  work papers), and a copy of each material report, schedule and
other document  filed or received by the Company pursuant to the requirements

Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a  manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of  the  Company. No

the Company shall not  take  any action to waive or release, or to exempt
any third party from, any  standstill arrangements to which it is a party or
the provisions of any Takeover  Laws; provided, however,  that  with
respect to such standstill arrangements, the Company may waive appropriate 
provisions  of such arrangements if requested to do so by the other party or
parties  thereto, but solely to the extent (i) necessary to permit such party
or parties  to submit a Company Takeover Proposal to the Company or the
Company\'s  stockholders, (ii) that following consultation with outside legal
counsel and  its financial advisors, the Board determines in good faith that
the failure  to  grant such waiver would violate the fiduciary duties of the
Board to the  stockholders of the Company under all applicable Law and (iii)
the Company  simultaneously, irrevocably and permanently waives compliance by
Parent with  paragraph 10 of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(a) duly  call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders  (the "Special Meeting")  for the purposes of considering and
taking action upon the approval and adoption  of this Agreement and the
Merger, including adjourning such meeting for up  to 30  Business Days to
obtain such approval. Except to the extent that the  Board shall have
withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this  Agreement as
permitted by Section 4.4, the Company shall (i) use reasonable  best 
efforts to solicit the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the 
Company and (ii) include in the Proxy Statement the Board\'s declaration of 
the  advisability of this Agreement and its recommendation to the
stockholders of  the  Company that they adopt this Agreement and approve
the  Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or 
postpone the Special Meeting as and to the extent required by applicable 
Law. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance  with

at  the Special Meeting even if the Board shall have effected a Change of 
Recommendation or a Withdrawal of Recommendation;

 

 

(b) prepare  and, within 45 days after the date hereof, file with the SEC a
preliminary  proxy  statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and,
after consultation  with  Parent, respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments made  by  the SEC with respect to the
preliminary proxy statement (including filing as  promptly as reasonably
practicable any amendments or supplements thereto  necessary to be filed in
response to any such comments or as required by  applicable Law), use
reasonable best efforts to have the SEC confirm that it  has  no further
comments and cause a definitive proxy statement, including any  amendments or
supplements thereto (the "Proxy Statement"), to be  mailed to its
stockholders at the earliest practicable date after the date  that  the SEC
confirms it has no further comments; provided, however,  that no  amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company  without
prior consultation with Parent and its counsel and after providing  Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such amendments or 
supplements; and

supplements to the proxy  statement or for additional information and supply
Parent with copies of all  correspondence between the Company or any of the
Company Representatives (as  defined in Section 4.4(b)), on the  one  hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the proxy 
statement. The Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to  review
and comment on the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or  supplement
thereto), any correspondence with the SEC or its staff or any other 
materials proposed to be submitted to the SEC or its staff prior to
transmission  to the SEC or its staff and shall not, unless required by Law,
transmit any  such  material to which Parent reasonably objects. If at any
time prior to  the Special Meeting there shall be discovered any information
that should be  set  forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, after obtaining  the  consent of Parent to such amendment or
supplement (which consent shall not  be  unreasonably withheld or delayed),
the Company shall promptly transmit such  amendment or supplement to its
stockholders.

No  Solicitation.

(a) For  purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal"  means
(other than the Merger) any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any indication  of
interest in making an offer or proposal, from any Person or group at any 
time  relating to (1) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
assets of  the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries representing 15% or
more of the assets  or  business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, including by way of the  purchase of stock of the Company
Subsidiaries, (2) any issuance, sale or other  disposition of (including by
way of merger, recapitalization, consolidation,  business combination, share
exchange, joint venture or any similar transaction)  securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities  convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities), including any single  or  multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, representing 15%  or  more of
the voting power of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (3) any  tender
offer, exchange offer or other transaction that, if consummated, would 
result in any Person or "group" (as such term is defined under  the Exchange
Act) having beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule  13d-3
under the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership,  of 
15% or more of the voting power or the capital stock of the Company or any 
Company Subsidiary, or (4) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business  combination, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution,
including any single  or multi-step transaction or series of related
transactions, involving the  Company or any Company Subsidiary. For purposes
of this Agreement, a  "Company Superior Offer"  means an unsolicited, bona
fide written Company Takeover Proposal (except that  the references to "15%"
shall be replaced by "50%")  on terms that the Board determines, in good
faith, based  upon consultations with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors,  (i) are more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders,
from a financial point  of  view, than this Agreement and the Merger, taken
as a whole, after giving effect  to any adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed in  writing by Parent in response to
such Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to  Section 4.4(e) or otherwise, and
(ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated  on  the terms so proposed, in
each case with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), taking  into account, among
other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing  and  other aspects
of, and conditions to, the Company Superior Offer and the Person  or group
making the Company Superior Offer (including any financing required  by 
such Person or group).

Subsidiary shall,  directly or indirectly, and shall not, directly or
indirectly, authorize or  permit any  officer, director, employee,
accountant, consultant, legal counsel, financial  advisor, agent or other
representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary  (collectively, the
"Company  Representatives") to, (i) solicit, encourage, assist, initiate or 
facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Company Takeover 
Proposal, (ii) furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or 
any  Company Subsidiary or the Merger to any Person or group (other than

discussions or  negotiations with any Person or group with respect to, or
that could be expected  to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv)
withdraw, modify or qualify,  or  propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent,  the approval of this Agreement or
the Merger or the Board\'s recommendation  that  holders of Shares adopt
this Agreement, (v) approve, endorse or recommend,  or  publicly propose to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Company Takeover  Proposal, (vi) cause the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to discuss, negotiate  or enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition  agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Company Takeover Proposal,  or (vii) release
any third party from, or waive any provision of, any  confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which the Company or any Company  Subsidiary is a
party (except as permitted pursuant to Section 4.2(c)  hereof). The Company
shall request the prompt return or destruction  of any confidential
information provided to any Person or group prior to the  date hereof in
connection with a possible Company Takeover Proposal, including  in
accordance with any confidentiality agreement entered into with such Person 
or group, and shall deny access to any data room (virtual or actual)
containing  any such information to any such Person or group. Without
limiting  the foregoing, it is agreed that any action by any Company
Representatives  that  would constitute a violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section  4.4  if done by the Company, whether or not such
Company Representative is purporting  to act on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, shall constitute  a  breach of this Section 4.4 by the
Company. The Company shall promptly  inform the Company Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section  4.4.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 4.4(b), nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit  or  limit the Company, or the Board, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company  Stockholder Approval, and so long as the
Company is in compliance in all  material respects with this Section 4.4,
from (i) furnishing non-public  information regarding the Company to, or (ii)
entering into discussions or  negotiations with, any Person or group in
response to an unsolicited, bona  fide  written Company Takeover Proposal
received after the date of this Agreement  that  did not result from a
violation of this Section 4.4, if (A) the Board  determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal and  financial advisors, that (1)
such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or  could be expected to result
in, after the taking of any of the actions referred  to in clauses (i) or
(ii) above, a Company Superior Offer, and (2) such  action with respect to
such Company Takeover Proposal is necessary for the  Board  to comply with
its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under all  applicable
Law; (B) the Company receives from such Person or group an  executed
confidentiality agreement with provisions no less favorable, in the 
aggregate, to the Company than, and with terms at least as restrictive of
such  Person or group (including with respect to the standstill provisions
thereof),  those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and (C)
contemporaneously  with  furnishing any such information to such Person or
group, the Company furnishes  such information to Parent to the extent that
such information has not been  previously furnished to Parent; provided,
however,  that prior  to  the taking of any such actions by the Company or
the Board as described in  clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company shall
provide written notice to Parent  of  such determination of the Board.

(d) The  Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within  48 hours) orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company
or any of the  Company Representatives of (i) any bona fide inquiries,
proposals or offers,  requests for information or requests for discussions or
negotiations regarding  or constituting any Company Takeover Proposal or any
bona fide inquiries,  proposals or offers, requests for information or
requests for discussions or  negotiations that could be expected to result in
a Company Takeover Proposal,  and (ii) any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or  the  Company Subsidiaries, specifying in each
case the material terms and conditions  thereof (including a copy thereof if
in writing) and the identity of the party  making such inquiry, proposal,
offer or request for information. The  Company shall keep Parent promptly
informed of the status of any such  discussions or negotiations and of any
modifications to such inquiries,  proposals, offers or requests for
information. From and after the  date of this Agreement, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Company  Subsidiary to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any solicitations,  discussions or negotiations with any
parties with respect to any Company  Takeover Proposal and shall direct, and
use its reasonable best efforts to  cause, the Company Representatives to
cease and terminate any such  solicitations, discussions or negotiations.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
Section 4.4(b), the Board  may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder  Approval: (A) withdraw or modify its recommendation that holders
of  Shares adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger in connection with a
Company  Takeover Proposal or (B) approve or recommend a Company Superior
Offer (each,  a  "Change of  Recommendation") if, in the case of both
clause (A) and (B) above (w) an  unsolicited, bona fide written offer is made
to the Company by a third party  representing a Company Takeover Proposal,
(x) the Company is in compliance  in  all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 4.4, (y) the  Board  determines in good faith
after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal  and  financial
advisors that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company  Superior
Offer (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms of this  Agreement
which may be proposed by Parent, including pursuant to clause (ii)  below),
and (z) following consultation with outside legal counsel and its  financial
advisors, the Board determines in good faith that the withdrawal  or 
modification of its recommendation that holders of Shares adopt this
Agreement  and approve the Merger is required to comply with the fiduciary
duties of the  Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
but only, in  the  case of both

clause  (A) and (B) above, if prior to taking any such action (i) the Company
provides  written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Offer")  advising
Parent (1) that the Board has received a Company Superior Offer and  intends
to make a Change of Recommendation in accordance with this Section  4.4(e),
(2) specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company  Superior
Offer(including a copy thereof if in writing) and identifying the  Person or
group making such Company Superior Offer, and (3) providing to Parent  all
materials and information delivered or made available to the Person or 
group  making such proposed Company Superior Offer (it being understood and
agreed  that  any amendment to the financial or other material terms of any
such proposed  Company Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of Superior
Offer and a new  five Business Day period), and (ii) during the five Business
Days following  Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior Offer, the
Company shall, and shall  direct the Company Representatives to, cooperate
and negotiate in good faith  with Parent (to the extent that Parent requests
the same) to enable Parent  to  propose in writing such adjustments to the
terms of this Agreement so that  any  Company Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute a Company Superior  Offer. Any Change of Recommendation shall not
change the approval of  this Agreement or any other approval of the Board in
any respect that would  have  the effect of causing any Takeover Law to be
applicable to the transactions  contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.4,
the Board may, prior  to  obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and
other than as a result of the  receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal,
withdraw or modify its approval of  this  Agreement or its recommendation
that the Company\'s stockholders adopt this  Agreement and approve the Merger
(a "Withdrawal of  Recommendation"), if the Board determines in good faith
(after  consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that the
failure  to  take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable  Law. Any Withdrawal of Recommendation shall not change the
approval  of this Agreement or any other approval of the Board in any respect
that would  have the effect of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to
the transactions  contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

 

(g) Nothing  contained in this Section 4.4 shall prohibit the Board from
taking and  disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule  14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act; provided, that any  such disclosure other than (i) a "stop-look-and-
listen"  communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f)  promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications
to the  stockholders of the Company), (ii) an express rejection of any
applicable  Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) an express reaffirmation of
its  recommendation to the stockholders of the Company in favor of the Merger
shall  be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation; provided further  that
the  Board shall not be permitted to recommend that the Company\'s
stockholders tender  any securities in connection with any tender or exchange
offer (or otherwise  approve, endorse or recommend any Company Takeover
Proposal or withhold,  withdraw or modify the recommendation that holders of
Shares adopt this  Agreement and approve the Merger), unless in each case, in
connection therewith,  the Board effects a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with the terms of  Section 4.4(e).

including the receipt of  all  Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined in
Section 6.1(c)), and to comply  as  promptly as practicable with all
requirements of Governmental Authorities  applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In  furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, to the extent required  under  the HSR Act or any other Laws that
are designed to prohibit, restrict or  regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint  of  trade ("Antitrust  Laws"), each
Party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a  Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act or other required filing  or 
application under Antitrust Laws, as applicable, with respect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, to supply as 
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary  material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or such
Antitrust Laws,  as applicable, and to take all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable  to  cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under  the  HSR Act or to obtain consent,
approvals or authorizations under Antitrust Laws  as soon as practicable,
including by requesting early termination of the waiting  period provided for
in the HSR Act.

 

 

(b) Each  of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand,  shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.2(a) to obtain  all  requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement under the HSR Act or any

connection with any  investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private  party; (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed
of any communication  received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,

Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in 
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any  of  the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other
Party and  its  outside counsel to review any communication given by it to,
and consult with  each other in advance of any meeting or conference with,
the FTC, the DOJ or  any  other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private  party, with any other Person, and to the
extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ  or  such other applicable Governmental
Authority or other Person, give the other  Party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meetings and  conferences.

 

 

(c) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained  in  Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b), (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable  following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent
shall cooperate  in  all respects with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective  subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to prepare and  file with the relevant insurance regulators requests
for approval of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger) and shall  use  all reasonable efforts to have such insurance
regulators approve the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
each of Parent and Merger  Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall give prompt  written notice if such Party receives any
notice from any insurance regulator  in  connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, in the  case of any such written notice,
shall promptly furnish the other Party with  a  copy thereof. If an
insurance regulator requires that a hearing be  held in connection with its
approval of the transactions contemplated hereby,  each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange for such  hearing to be held promptly. At
Parent\'s request, the Company shall  obtain from applicable regulatory
authorities written assurances in form  reasonably satisfactory to Parent
with respect to the applicability to the  Company and/or any of the Company
Subsidiaries of orders, decrees or  pronouncements of such regulatory
authorities.

(d) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained  in  Section 5.2(a), Section 5.2(b) and Section 5.2(c), if any
objections are  asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under the HSR  Act,  any Antitrust Law or any other applicable Law or if any
suit is instituted  (or  threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or
any other applicable  Governmental Authority or any private party challenging
any of the transactions  contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act, any
Antitrust Law or any other  applicable Law or which would otherwise prevent,
materially impede or materially  delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of Parent,  Merger Sub and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve  any  such objections or suits so as
to permit consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
including in order to resolve such objections  or  suits which, in any case
if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to  prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger).

 

 

(e) In  the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted  (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or
private party  challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement,  or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and  the  Company shall cooperate in all respects with
each other and use its respective  reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding  and  to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction  or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect  and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(f) Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts  to obtain any Consents of third parties with respect to
any Contracts to which  the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party as
may be necessary or  appropriate for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or  required by the terms of any Contract as a result of
the execution, performance  or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the  Merger).

respective affiliates to  take  any action or commit to take any action, or
consent or agree to any condition,  restriction or undertaking requested or
imposed by any Governmental Authority,  whether in connection with obtaining
any Requisite Regulatory Approval or  otherwise, if, in the good faith
determination of Parent, such action,  condition, restriction or undertaking,
individually or in the aggregate, with  all other such actions, conditions,
restrictions or undertakings, would  materially adversely affect the
benefits, taken as a whole, that Parent  reasonably expects to derive from
the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement (a "Burdensome 
Condition"); provided, however,  that any  requirement that Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its or their  subsidiaries (i) provide or
commit to provide additional capital to the Company,  (ii) maintain
operations or employees in the State of Florida, or (iii) provide  any
surplus maintenance, guarantee, keep-well or similar agreements or

Indemnification  and  Insurance.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) The  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall  contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
than are  set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
respectively, of  the  Company, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified  for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would  affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the  Effective Time, were directors,
officers, or employees, of the Company or any  of  the Company Subsidiaries.
During the period ending on the sixth  anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,  jointly and severally, to the
fullest extent that the Company would have been  permitted to do so under
applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each  present and former director
and officer of the Company and each of the Company  Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against  all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines,  losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection  with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising  before or
after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative  or 
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission, in
his  or  her capacity as an officer, director, or employee of the Company,
occurring  on  or before the Effective Time (a "Covered  Proceeding"). In
the event of any such claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay  the  reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,  which counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation,  promptly after
statements therefor are received (provided the  applicable Indemnified Party
provides an undertaking to repay all advanced  expenses if it is finally
judicially determined that such Indemnified Party  is  not entitled to
indemnification); provided, however,  that neither  Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected  without Parent\'s or
the Surviving Corporation\'s written consent (which consent  shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, further,  that Parent  and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to agree to the entry of  any 
judgment or settlement that provides for injunctive or other non-monetary
relief  affecting the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective  subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be  obligated pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) to pay the fees and expenses of
more  than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified
Parties)  for all Indemnified Parties with respect to such Covered Proceeding
unless  there  is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any  significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties,  in which case Parent shall pay the fees of such
additional counsel required  by  such conflict; provided, that, in  the
event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such 
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim
shall  continue until the disposition of such claim. Any Indemnified Party 
that desires to claim indemnification under this Section 5.3(a) upon
becoming  aware of any such Covered Proceeding shall promptly notify Parent
and the  Surviving Corporation.

(b) Immediately  after the Effective Time, Parent shall have obtained and
paid for, and there  shall be in effect, a tail policy of (i) directors\' and
officers\' liability  insurance and (ii)  corporate counsel liability
insurance covering the Company\'s Senior Vice  President, General Counsel and
Secretary, in respect of acts or omissions  occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each of those Persons who are  covered by (x) the Company\'s
and any Company Subsidiary\'s directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance
policy and (y) corporate counsel liability  insurance, as of the date hereof
for a period of six years commencing as of  the  Effective Time, it being
understood that, if requested in writing by Parent,  the  Company shall,
prior to the Effective Time, obtain such extended reporting  period coverage
under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of  the  Effective
Time).

 

 

(c) In  the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person  and  shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such  consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its  properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper  provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the  Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations  set  forth in this Section 5.3.

 

 

(d) Parent  shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of  the  Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.3.

 

 

(e) The  provisions of this Section 5.3 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of,  and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and  representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for,  any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may  have by contract or otherwise.

or the Company  Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an "Employee"),
while such  Employee remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or any
of its  subsidiaries, with at least the same level of base salary or wages,
that was  provided to each such Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and  (ii)  provide the Employees with base salary, wages, cash
incentive compensation,  other cash variable compensation and other employee
benefits (other than  equity-based compensation) that are, in the aggregate,
no less favorable than,  at Parent\'s election, (A) those provided to such
Employees immediately prior  to  the Effective Time or (B) those provided to
similarly situated employees of  Parent, or at Parent\'s election, any
subsidiary of Parent.

(b) Each  Employee shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate,  vesting, and, solely with respect to vacation, other paid time
off and  severance, benefit accrual (but excluding benefit accruals under any
defined  benefit pension plan or for any other purpose) under any employee
benefit plan,  program or arrangement (including vacation plans, programs and
arrangements)  established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their  respective subsidiaries under which such Employee is
eligible to participate  on  or after the Effective Time for service with
the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries through the Effective Time to the
same extent recognized for such  purpose by the Company  or any of the
Company Subsidiaries under comparable Company Employee Plans  immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,  that such  crediting of
service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding  of any
such benefit.

 

 

(c) With  respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained,  sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation ("Parent Welfare Benefit Plans")  in which an Employee is or
becomes eligible to participate on or after the  Effective Time, Parent shall
(a) waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive,  all limitations as to
preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect  to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to each Employee under  any  Parent
Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Company 
Employee Plan (to the extent permitted by the applicable Parent Welfare
Benefit  Plan), and (b) provide credit to each Employee for any co-payments,
deductibles  and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee under the
Company Employee  Plans during the plan year that includes the Effective Time
for the plan year  under the applicable Parent Welfare Benefit Plan that
includes the Effective  Time.

 

 

(d) From  and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
honor, in  accordance with their terms, all employment and severance
agreements listed  in Section 5.4(d)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
effect immediately prior to the Effective  Time that are applicable to any
current or former employees or directors of  the  Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Section 5.4 shall amend, or be deemed to amend, any
Company Employee  Plan, shall prevent the amendment or termination of any
Company Employee Plans  by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective subsidiaries, or shall  limit the right of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective  subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any Employee at any  time.

 

 

(f) Unless  otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least one Business Day
prior to  the  Effective Time, the Company will terminate the Company\'s
401(k) (the "Company 401(k) Plan"),  effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time. The  Company shall provide Parent evidence that
such resolutions to terminate the  Company 401(k) Plan have been adopted by
the Board. The form and  substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
the reasonable approval of  Parent. The Company shall also take such other
actions in furtherance  of terminating the Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may
reasonably  request. Immediately prior to such termination, the Company will
make  (or cause to be made) all necessary payments to fund the contributions
(i)  necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status of the
Company 401(k)  Plan, (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to Company
401(k) Plan for  the  period prior to termination, and (iii) for employer
matching contributions  (if  any) for the period prior to termination.

Public  Announcements.

Parent  and the Company agree that no public release or announcement
concerning this  Agreement or the Merger shall be issued by either Party or
any of their  affiliates without the prior consent of the other Party (which
consent shall  not  be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except  as  such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules  or 
regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the applicable Party 
shall  use reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time
to comment  on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance;
provided, however,  that either  Parent or the Company may make any public
statement in response to specific  questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry  conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such  statements are not inconsistent with
previous public releases or announcements  made by Parent or the Company in
compliance with this Agreement.

As  promptly as practical following the date of this Agreement, and in any
event  within 10 Business Days, and in compliance with applicable Law, Parent
and  the  Company shall develop a joint plan for the communication by the
Company  regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger)  with the Company Producers. The Company shall obtain the
written  consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned  or  delayed) prior to initiating any communication with any
Company Producers  regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the  Merger). Without the prior written consent of the Company
(such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
Parent shall  not orally or in writing initiate any communication with any
Company Producer,  provided, however,  that the  foregoing shall not
prohibit Parent from responding to inquiries initiated  by  Company
Producers. For purposes of this Section 5.6, "Company Producers" shall not
mean any insurance  producer,  reinsurance intermediary, agency, agent,
managing general agent, wholesaler,  broker or other Person with whom Parent
or any subsidiary of Parent has an  existing relationship as of the date
hereof.

The  Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate  in connection with the arrangement of any financing by Parent or
any of its  subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement  (the "Financing") as may  be reasonably requested by Parent
(provided that such requested cooperation  does  not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries and;
provided, further,  that Parent  reimburses the Company for any reasonable
costs or expenses incurred in  connection with such cooperation). Such
cooperation by the Company  shall include (a) providing to the parties
providing Financing all financial  statements and other information relating
to the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries that are reasonably required for
financings similar to the  Financing and using reasonable best efforts to
provide such other financial  information as Parent shall reasonably request
in order to consummate the  Financing, (b) review for accuracy (i) one or
more offering documents or  confidential information memoranda for the
Financing and (ii) materials for  rating agency presentations, (c) executing
and delivering and causing the  Company Subsidiaries to execute and deliver,
customary certificates and similar  items ancillary to the Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in  connection with the Financing, and (d)
assisting Parent in requesting accounting  comfort letters from the
Company\'s independent  auditors. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary,  neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to pay any  commitment or other fee or incur any other liability 
or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any replacements thereof) 
prior to the Effective Time.

Termination.

This  Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time,  notwithstanding any approval of the matters presented in connection
with the  Merger by the stockholders of the Company (the date of any such
termination,  the  "Termination Date"), as  follows:

 

 

(a) by  mutual written consent of each of the Company and Parent, as duly
authorized  by  the Board of Directors of each of Parent the Company;

 

 

(b) by  written notice by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time
shall  not  have occurred on or before October 31, 2008 (the "Outside
Date"); provided, however,  that the  right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be  available to any Party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this  Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Merger  to be  consummated on or before the

(c) by  written notice by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental
Authority  shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Order or Law  that is, in each case, then in effect and is final and
nonappealable and has  the  effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise preventing or  prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the  Merger); provided, however,  that the  right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be  available to

(d) by  written notice by Parent (if Parent is not in material breach of any
of its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement),  if  there has been a breach by the Company of any of its
representations,  warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, or if any  representation or warranty of the Company shall have
become untrue or  inaccurate, in either case that would result in a failure
of a condition set  forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) (a "Terminating Company
Breach"); provided,  that  if such Terminating Company Breach is reasonably
curable by the Company, within  20 days after the Company has received
written notice from Parent of such Terminating  Company Breach, through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts and  for  as long as the Company
continues to exercise such commercially reasonable  efforts, Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d)  until  the earlier of
the expiration of such 20-day period and the Outside  Date;

 

 

(e) by  written notice by the Company (if the Company is not in material
breach of  any  of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
under this  Agreement), if there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
any of its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this  Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
shall  have become untrue or inaccurate, in either case that would result in
a failure  of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) (a
"Terminating Parent Breach"); provided,  that  if such Terminating Parent
Breach is reasonably curable by Parent or Merger  Sub,  within 20 days after
Parent has received written notice from the Company of  such  Terminating
Parent Breach, through the exercise of commercially reasonable  efforts and
for as long as Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, continues  to
exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, the Company may not terminate 
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) until the earlier of the expiration 
of  such 20-day period and the Outside Date;

 

 

(f) by  written notice by Parent, if the Board (i) withdraws, modifies or
qualifies  in a  manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly
proposes to withdraw, modify  or qualify in a manner adverse to parent or
Merger Sub, its recommendation  that  the holders of Shares adopt this
Agreement; (ii) fails to include in the Proxy  Statement its recommendation
to the holders of Shares that they give the Company  Stockholder Approval;
(iii) approves, endorses or recommends, or publicly  proposes to approve,
endorse or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv)  makes a Change of
Recommendation or a Withdrawal of Recommendation, or (v)  in  the case of a
Company Takeover Proposal made by way of a tender offer or  exchange offer,
fails to recommend that the Company\'s stockholders reject such  tender offer
or exchange offer within the ten Business Day period specified  in  Section
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or (if later than the end of such ten 
Business Day period) fails to reconfirm its recommendation that the holders 
of  Shares adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger within five Business
Days  after a request by Parent to do so; or

 

 

(g) by  written notice by either Parent or the Company, if, at the Special
Meeting  (including any adjournment or postponement thereof at which this
Agreement  is  voted upon), the Company Stockholder Approval is not
obtained; provided, however,  that the  right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(g) shall not be  available to the Company where the
failure to obtain the Company Stockholder  Approval shall have resulted from
the Company\'s breach of this  Agreement.

Effect  of  Termination.

In  the  event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1,
this  Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability
on the  part of any Party hereto or any of their respective affiliates or the
directors,  officers, partners, members, managers, employees, agents or
other  representatives of any of them, and all rights and obligations of each
Party  hereto shall cease, except (i) as set forth in this Section 7.2 and in
Section  7.3 and Article VIII  and  (ii) subject to Section 7.3(c), nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from  liability for any fraud or willful
breach of this Agreement. Without  limiting the foregoing, Section 4.2(b),
this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and  Article VIII shall survive the termination
of this Agreement. Prior  to the Effective Time, the liability of Parent and
Merger Sub to the Company  under the Agreement is specifically limited to the
amount of the Parent  Termination Fee, if and as payable in accordance with
Section  7.3(c).

Fees  and  Expenses.

(a) Except  as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.3, all Expenses incurred
in connection  with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid  by  the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the
Merger or any other  related transaction is consummated; provided, however, 
that the  filing fee under the HSR Act shall be borne equally by the Company
and  Parent. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" shall include all  out-
of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, 
investment bankers, financing sources, experts and consultants to a Party
hereto  and its affiliates) incurred by a Party or on its behalf in
connection with  or  related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution or performance  of this Agreement, the preparation, printing,
filing or mailing of the Proxy  Statement, the solicitation of stockholder
approvals and all other matters  related to the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions  contemplated hereby

 

 

(b) If

 

 

(i) (x)  at any time on or after the date of this Agreement, a Company
Takeover Proposal  is made to the Board or the Company or is publicly
proposed or publicly  disclosed or any Person or group shall have publicly
announced or disclosed  an  intention to make a Company Takeover Proposal,
(y) thereafter, this Agreement  is  terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section  7.1(g), or by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(d), and (z) on or within 12 months  after the date of such
termination, any definitive agreement providing for  a  Qualifying
Transaction shall have been executed or a Qualifying Transaction  shall have
been consummated with any Person;

 

 

(ii) this  Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f); or,

 

 

(iii) this  Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(g)  and  prior to such termination, the Company shall have made
a Change of  Recommendation or a Withdrawal of Recommendation,

then  in  any such event the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $8,000,000
in cash  (the  "Termination Fee"), such  payment to be made (1) in the case
of termination described in Section  7.3(b)(i), upon the earlier to occur of
execution of an agreement providing  for  a Qualifying Transaction or
consummation of such Qualifying Transaction, and  (2)  in the case of a
termination described in Section 7.3(b)(ii) or Section  7.3(b)(iii), within
two Business Days after such termination. In  addition, in the case of any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section  7.1(g), (1) the Expenses
of Parent shall be paid by the Company to Parent in  cash (A) concurrently
with and as a condition to any such termination effected  by the Company 
and (B) on the second Business Day following any such termination effected 
by  Parent, and (2) the amount of such Expenses so paid shall not be in
excess  of  $2,000,000 and shall be credited against the Termination Fee
that is or becomes  payable in connection with such termination pursuant to
this Section  7.3(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be
required  to pay the Termination Fee or the Expenses pursuant to more than
one clause  of  this Section 7.3(b). For the purposes of this Agreement, a
"Qualifying Transaction" means  any Company Takeover Proposal (substituting
"50%" for "15%"  in the definition of "Company Takeover  Proposal").

 

 

(c) Parent  agrees that (i) if this Agreement shall be terminated by the
Company pursuant  to  Section 7.1(e) as a result of a breach by Parent of
(x) Section 3.7 or (y)  its  covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and (ii) the notice of  termination includes a demand, which demand
shall be irrevocable, to receive  the  Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall
pay $8,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") to  the Company no later than
two (2) Business Days after such termination, provided that the  Company\'s
right to receive the Parent Termination Fee shall terminate and be  of  no
further force or effect (1) if the Company makes any demand or claim for 
Company Damages (as defined below) in any Action, other than for the payment 
of  the Parent Termination Fee, or (2) if any condition to the obligation of
Parent  or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 6.2
becomes  incapable of being satisfied. Notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, the right to receive the Parent Termination Fee 
in  accordance with this Section 7.3(c) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy  (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the
Company,  the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their affiliates against
Parent, Merger  Sub and any of their respective current, former or future
directors, officers,  employees, agents, partners, managers, members,
affiliates, stockholders,  assignees or representatives for any loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense  (x) suffered in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated  hereby (including any breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub) or  (y)  as a result of the failure of
the Merger or any of the other transactions  contemplated hereby to be
consummated in circumstances giving rise to the right  to receive the Parent
Termination Fee ("Company Damages"), and upon  payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, none of Parent, Merger Sub and any of  their respective
current, former or future directors, officers, employees,  agents, partners,
managers, members, affiliates, stockholders, assignees or  representatives
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to  or  arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby. For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall Parent or  Merger Sub have any liability under or
in respect of this Agreement or the  transactions related hereto (including
the Merger) in excess of an aggregate  amount equal to the Parent Termination
Fee and the Parent Termination Fee shall  not be payable on more than one
instance.

 

 

(d) In  the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when
due or  Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, the
Company shall  reimburse Parent or Parent shall reimburse the Company, as the
case may be,  for  all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by Parent or  the  Company, as the case may be(including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel),  in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 7.3  and  such Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall accrue  interest for the period
commencing on the date such Termination Fee or Parent  Termination Fee, as
the case may be, first became due, at a rate of interest  published from 
time  to time in The Wall Street  Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor
publication thereto),  designated therein as the prime rate on the date such
Termination Fee or Parent  Termination Fee, as the case may be, was due.

(e) Each  of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee, the
Parent  Termination Fee and the other provisions of this Section 7.3 are an
integral  part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the
Termination  Fee, the Parent Termination Fee and the other provisions of this
Section 7.3  are  not subject to the requirement that the Company
Stockholder Approval be obtained  and that these provisions shall be
effective without regard to whether the  Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained. Each of the Parties hereto  further acknowledges that, without the
Termination Fee, the Parent Termination  Fee and the other provisions of this
Section 7.3, neither Parent nor the Company  would not enter into this
Agreement, and that neither the Termination Fee nor  the Parent Termination
Fee is a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in  a  reasonable amount
that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may  be, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while  negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the  expectation of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which  amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

This  Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto by action taken by or on

Effective  Time; provided, that,  after the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger by the  stockholders of the Company, no amendment may
be made that would reduce the  amount or change the type of consideration
into which each Share shall be  converted upon consummation of the Merger or
that would otherwise by Law require  approval of the stockholders of the
Company, without approval of such  stockholders. This Agreement may only be
amended pursuant to a  written agreement signed by each of the Parties
hereto.

performance of any  obligation or other act of any other Party hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracy  in  the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered  pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any agreement or condition  contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if  set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party or Parties to be  bound  thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the  Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate  as  a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude  any 
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

This  Agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance
with the  Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of
laws principles  thereof. All Actions arising out of or relating to this
Agreement  shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or
federal  court. The Parties hereto hereby (A) submit to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of any Delaware state or federal court for the purpose of any 
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party
hereto  and (B) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion,
defense  or  otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject
personally  to  the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or  immune from attachment or execution, that the Action
is brought in an  inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is
improper, or that this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
not be enforced in or  by  any of the above-named courts; provided,
however,  that such  consent to jurisdiction is solely for the purpose
referred to in this Section  8.4 and shall not be deemed to be a general
submission to the jurisdiction  of  such court or in the State of Delaware
other than for such  purposes. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a  final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be  enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner  provided by Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company 
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any
other  process in any other action or proceeding relating to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal  delivery of copies of such process to such Party.
Nothing in this  Section 8.4 shall affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any  other manner permitted by Law.

Each  of  the Parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable  Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to
any Action directly  or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection
with this Agreement or  the  transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Parties hereto (A)  certifies that no representative, agent or attorney  of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other 
party would not, in the event of any Action, seek to enforce that foregoing 
waiver and (B) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto have been 
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers  and certifications in this Section 8.5.

Severability.

In  case  any provision in this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable  in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified or
