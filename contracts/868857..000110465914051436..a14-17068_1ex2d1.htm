becomes effective being the " _Second Effective Time_ ").

 **ARTICLE II 
EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OR EQUITY INTERESTS OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock in the Merger_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock or
equity interests of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Excluded Shares, (ii) Election Award Shares, and (iii) Dissenting Shares)
shall thereupon be converted into the right, at the election of such shares
holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.3, to receive any of
the following forms of consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

 



 

(i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock
Election (as defined herein) has been validly made and not revoked pursuant to
Section 2.3 (collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "), the right to
receive from Parent the number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio
(collectively, the " _Stock Consideration_ ");

 



 

(ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election (as defined herein) has been validly made and not revoked pursuant to
Section 2.3 (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "), the right to
receive in cash from Parent an amount equal to the Per Share Amount
(collectively, the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and

 



 

(iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Cash Election or a Stock Election has been validly made and not revoked
pursuant to Section 2.3 (collectively, the " _Non-Election Shares_ "), the
right to receive from Parent such Stock Consideration and/or Cash
Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 2.2.

 



 

(iv) _Definitions_.

 



 

(A) " _Cash Component_ " shall mean $2,257,950,321.

 



 

(B) " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest one
ten thousandth, of (a) the Per Share Amount divided by (b) the Parent Closing
Price.

 



 

(C) " _Per Share Amount_ " shall mean the sum, rounded to the nearest one-
tenth of a cent, of (A) $33.00 plus (B) the product, rounded to the nearest
one tenth of a cent, of the Share Ratio times the Parent Closing Price.

 



 

(D) " _Parent Closing Price_ " shall mean the average, rounded to the nearest
one tenth of a cent, of the closing sales prices of shares of Parent Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall
Street Journal_ for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date
on which the Effective Time occurs.

 



      
 

 



 

(E) " _Share Ratio_ " shall mean 0.734, based on the closing sales price of
shares of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the last Business Day before the
effective date of this Agreement, so that the aggregate stock consideration,
valued using such closing sales price, is at least equal to 41% of the total
aggregate mix of cash and stock consideration.

 



 

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.6, without
interest, and, if applicable, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.6(f); _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, Election Award
Shares shall be treated as provided in the applicable subsection of Section
2.4.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock (i) held in the treasury of the Company
or (ii) owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (the shares of Company Common Stock in clauses (i) and
(ii) collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) Each of the membership interests of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) The Share Ratio, and any similarly dependent item, as the case may be,
shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, proportionately to reflect
the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (including for this purpose any securities convertible into, or
exerciable for, Company Common Stock) or Parent Common Stock having a record
date occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time to proportionately reflect such change; _provided_ , that
nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit any party hereto
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the
ratio of (x) the Cash Component to (y) the sum of (A) the Cash Component and
(B) the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock (excluding
Election Award Shares) and (ii) the closing sales price of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE the last Business Day before the date of this Agreement shall
under no circumstances exceed 59%. This provision together with the
methodologies described above for determining the Cash Component and the
aggregate number

 



      
 

 



 

of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger are intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 1.368-1(e)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate consideration to be paid by
Parent in respect of the Merger Consideration to holders of Company Common
Stock (excluding Election Award Shares) shall be equal to the Cash Component
(assuming all Dissenting Shares receive cash equal to the Per Share Amount)
and 50,222,289 shares of Parent Common Stock (assuming 68,422,737 shares of
Company Common Stock (excluding Election Award Shares) are outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing and subject to increase or decrease in the
event such number is increased or decreased, in each case as provided by this
Article II).

 



 

Section 2.2 _Proration_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding any Election Award Shares)
to be converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii)
(which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting Shares
determined as of the Effective Time) (the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall
be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Component by (y)
the Per Share Amount. All other shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares, any Election Award Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into Stock Consideration.

 



 

(b) Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent (as defined herein) to effect the allocation among
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding Election Award
Shares) of the rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration as follows:

 



 

(i) if the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding
Election Award Shares) with respect to which Cash Elections shall have been
made (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Dissenting
Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the " _Total Cash Election
Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then (A) all Stock Election
Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration, and (B) Cash Election Shares of each holder
thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number (with the Exchange
Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.2(a), whether fractions of Cash
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(ii) if the Total Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number
(the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Total Cash
Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then
all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, and the Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be
treated in the following manner:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by
(2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with Section 2.2(a), whether fractions
of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration; or

 



 

(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
(1) all Non-Election Shares shall convert into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and (2) all Stock Election Shares shall convert into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election
Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Stock
Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number
of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of
Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with
Section 2.2(a), whether fractions of Stock Election Shares shall be rounded up
or down), with the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares
being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Election_. Each Person who is a record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock (excluding Election Award Shares) on the Election Form Record Date (as
defined herein) shall have the right to submit an Election Form specifying (an
" _Election_ ") the number of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, held by
such Person that such Person desires to have converted into the right to
receive Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") and the number of such
shares that the holder desires to have converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Amount in cash (a " _Cash Election_ "). Holders of record of Company
Common Stock who hold such Company Common Stock as nominees, trustees or in
other representative capacities may submit a separate Election Form on or
before the Election Deadline with respect to each beneficial owner for whom
such nominee, trustee or representative holds such Company Common Stock.
Parent shall prepare and direct the Exchange Agent to mail a form of election,
which form shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (the "
_Election Form_ "), with the Joint Proxy Statement to the record holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Restricted Stock as of the record date for
the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Form Record Date_ "), which
Election Form shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock who wishes to make an Election.

 



 

(b) _New Holders_. Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as
may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become
holders or beneficial owners of Company Common Stock before the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts provide the
Exchange Agent with all information reasonably necessary for it to perform its
duties as specified herein.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Revocations; Exchange Agent_. An Election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by
5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on a date prior to the Effective Time to be mutually
agreed to by the Company and Parent (the " _Election Deadline_ "), an Election
Form properly completed and signed and accompanied by Certificates (unless
such shares of Company Common Stock are Book-Entry Shares, in which case the
holders shall follow the instructions set forth in the Election Form) of
Company Common Stock to which such Election Form relates, duly endorsed in
blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company
(or an appropriate affidavit attesting to the loss, theft, misplacement or
destruction, as applicable of such Certificate(s) and a bond of indemnity, in
each case in form reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent and Parent or by
an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such
Election Form; _provided_ that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent within five (5) Business Days after the date of execution of
such guarantee of delivery). Any stockholder may (i) change his Election by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline,
accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Election Form or (ii)
revoke his Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his
Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, previously
deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Election Forms shall automatically be
revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by the Company and Parent
that the Merger has been abandoned and that this Agreement has been
terminated. If an Election Form is revoked, the Certificate(s) (or guarantees
of delivery, as appropriate), if any, for the shares of Company Common Stock
to which such Election Form relates shall be promptly returned to the
stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange Agent.

 



 

(d) _Determination of Exchange Agent Binding_. Subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Agent Agreement, the determination of the Exchange Agent shall be
binding as to whether an Election shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this Section 2.3 with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
and when Elections and revocations were received by it. Subject to the
provisions of the Exchange Agent Agreement, if the Exchange Agent determines
that any Election was not properly made with respect to any shares of Company
Common Stock, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated by the
Exchange Agent as Non-Election Shares. Subject to the provisions of the
Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent also shall make all computations
as to the allocation and the proration contemplated by Section 2.2, and any
such computation shall be conclusive and binding on Parent and the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock that vests based solely on the continued
service of the holder of such award (each, a " _Company TBRSU_ ") and each
share of Company Common Stock subject to restrictions on transfer and/or
forfeiture (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") that vests based solely on the
continued service of the holder of such award (" _TB Restricted Stock_ "), in
each case, granted under any employee or director stock option, stock purchase
or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company in effect
as of the date hereof (the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") that is not vested as
of the Effective Time and does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set
forth in an applicable award agreement or employment agreement) as a result of
the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent Company
Common Stock or a right to receive shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, into an award with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Parent Award_ "), on the same terms and conditions
(including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights) as were
applicable under such TB Restricted Stock or Company TBRSU as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such Parent Award to be equal to the number of shares of TB
Restricted Stock or the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
each Company TBRSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), with any corresponding
accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any share of TB Restricted Stock
and dividend equivalents with respect to any Company TBRSU to be assumed,
remain outstanding and continue to represent an obligation with respect to the
applicable Parent Award.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award
with respect to shares of Company Common Stock that is subject, in whole or in
part, to performance-based vesting (each, a " _Company PBRSU_ ") and each
share of Company Restricted Stock that is subject, in whole or in part, to
performance-based vesting (" _PB Restricted Stock_ "), in each case, granted
under any Company Equity Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
(with any performance-based vesting conditions deemed earned at the target
performance level) by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any outstanding Company PBRSU granted in March 2013 with a two-year
performance period ending January 2, 2015 (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, all such Company PBRSUs that would otherwise vest in accordance with
their terms (as set forth in an applicable award agreement or employment
agreement) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
shall only become vested if and to the extent the Company Board (or
appropriate committee thereof) determines prior to the Effective Time that the
performance goals applicable to such awards have been achieved based on
performance as of the month-end immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
the portion that does not so vest will be forfeited immediately prior to the
Effective Time without payment of any consideration therefor). With respect to
each share of PB Restricted Stock that vests in accordance with this Section
2.4(b) (" _Vesting PB Restricted Stock_ ") or Company Common Stock subject to
a Company PBRSU that vests in accordance with this Section 2.4(b) (each, a "
_Vesting PBRSU_ "), the holder of the PB Restricted Stock or Company PBRSU
shall be entitled to receive, at the election of each such PB Restricted Stock
or Company PBRSU holder, the Election Award Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.9 (without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to
be withheld in accordance with Section 2.7, which Taxes shall first be
withheld from the aggregate Cash Consideration), plus any accrued but unpaid
dividends or dividend equivalents (less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld), to be paid and/or delivered within forty-five (45) days after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that with respect to the Company PBRSUs and related
dividend equivalent payments for which delivery or payment in respect thereof
as described in this Section 2.4(b) would violate any applicable provision of
Section 409A of the Code, such delivery or payment shall be made on the
earliest practicable date that delivery or payment may be made without
violating any applicable provision of Section 409A of the Code with such
Election Award Merger Consideration and related dividend

 



      
 

 



 

equivalent payments to be held through such permissible payment date in a
deferred compensation account for the benefit of the individual holder.

 



 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company TBRSU that is vested
but has not been settled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
each Company TBRSU that is unvested and vests in accordance with its terms (as
set forth in an applicable award agreement or employment agreement) as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each, a " _Vesting
TBRSU_ "), in each case, that is outstanding as immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof become fully vested in accordance with its
terms and, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company TBRSU, the holder of such Company TBRSU shall be entitled to receive
at the election of each such Company TBRSU holder, the Election Award Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.9 (without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.7, which
Taxes shall first be withheld first from the aggregate Cash Consideration),
plus any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents, (less any applicable Taxes
required to be withheld), to be paid and/or delivered to the holder of such
Company TBRSU within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that, with respect to the Company TBRSUs and related dividend equivalent
payments for which delivery or payment as described in this Section 2.4(c)
would violate any applicable provision of Section 409A of the Code, such
delivery or payment shall be made on the earliest practicable date that
delivery may be made without violating any applicable provision of Section
409A of the Code with such Election Award Merger Consideration and related
dividend equivalent payments to be held through such permissible payment date
in a deferred compensation account for the benefit of the individual holder.

 



 

(d) With respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to each
deferred stock award granted to a non-employee member of the Company Board and
the deferred Company RSU listed on Schedule 2.4(d) (" _Company Deferred Stock_
") that is outstanding as immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder
of such Company Deferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, at the election
of each such Company Deferred Stock holder, the Election Award Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.9 (without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.7, which
Taxes shall be withheld first from the aggregate Cash Consideration), plus any
accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents (less any applicable Taxes required to
be withheld). The delivery and/or payment of the Merger Consideration and any
dividend equivalents shall be made on the first business day that follows the
six (6) month anniversary of Company Deferred Stock holders "separation from
service" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) or
such earlier practicable date that delivery and/or payment may be made without
violating any applicable provision of Section 409A of the Code, with such
Election Award Merger Consideration and related dividend equivalent payments
to be held through such permissible payment date in a deferred compensation
account for the benefit of the individual holder.

 



 

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each share of TB
Restricted Stock that is unvested and vests in accordance with its terms (as
set forth in an applicable award agreement or employment agreement) as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares being " _Vesting TB
Restricted Stock_ "), all restrictions and forfeiture conditions shall

 



      
 

 



 

lapse and expire by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, and such shares of TB Restricted Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive, at the election of each such TB
Restricted Stock holder, the Election Award Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.9, treating such Vesting TB Restricted Stock in the same manner
as all other shares of Company Common Stock for such purposes. In addition,
any accrued but unpaid dividends in respect of the TB Restricted Stock shall
vest in full and be paid in cash within thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the aggregate number of Shares of Parent
Common Stock available for such Election Award Shares shall be the Share Ratio
multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Election Award Shares and (2) the aggregate amount of cash available
for such Election Award Shares shall be the product of (i) $33.00 multiplied
by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Election Award Shares (such product, the " _Cash Award Component_ ").

 



 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary
to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.4(a) through Section 2.4(e). The
Company shall ensure that, as of immediately following the Effective Time, no
holder of a Company TBRSU, Company PBRSU, Company Deferred Stock or Company
Restricted Stock (or former holder of an option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock) or a participant in any Company Equity Plan shall have any
rights thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock
of the Company, the Ultimate Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries, or
any other equity interest therein.

 



 

(h) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to Parent Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.4. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form
S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms, including Form S-3) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Awards and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Parent Awards remain outstanding and are required to be registered.

 



 

(i) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary under the Companys
2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") to cause, no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) accumulated Contributions
(as defined under the ESPP) under any then-ongoing Offering (as defined under
the ESPP) to be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP and (ii) the termination of all Purchase Rights (as
defined in the ESPP) under all such ongoing Offerings immediately after such
purchase. For clarity, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary
to terminate the ESPP no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. In addition, the Company shall take such action as may be
necessary under the ESPP such that (i) no new Offering shall commence from and
after the commencement of the Offering beginning on or about July 1, 2014;
(ii) participants in any ongoing Offerings shall not be permitted to increase
their level of participation in such Offerings from and after the date of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement; and (iii) with respect to the Offering beginning on or about
July 1, 2014, each participant shall be permitted to participate at the level
of participation elected by such participant in accordance with the previously
delivered election materials.

shares of capital stock or equity interests of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Merger Sub I:

 



 

(a) Each of the membership interests of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership interest
of the Ultimate Surviving Entity.

 



 

(b) Each of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Exchange and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, Parent shall enter into
a customary exchange agent agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ")
providing for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Article II, which agreement shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the
Company, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, book-entry shares (or certificates
if requested) representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 2.1(a). In addition, prior to or substantially simultaneously with
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the
Exchange Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall make available by depositing
with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective
Time, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(d) (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such
deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for
addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to
pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.6(f). The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in Section 2.6(i),
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (other than those holders of
Certificates who have properly completed and submitted, and have not revoked,
Election Forms pursuant to Section 2.3) (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be
in customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent, the Company and
the Exchange Agent shall reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.6(f). Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal or
an Election Form, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) cash or a check in an amount equal to the
amount of cash such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
in respect of such Certificates, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to Section
2.1(a) (after taking into account all other Book-Entry Shares converted and
Certificates surrendered by such holder pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)), (C)
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and
(D) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
pursuant to Section 2.6(f), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent and the Ultimate Surviving
Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and deliver to each holder of
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") (1) cash or check in an amount equal to the amount such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of such
Book-Entry Shares, (2) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (after
taking into account all other Book-Entry Shares converted and Certificates
surrendered by such holder pursuant to this Section 2.6(b)), (C) any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and (D) cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.6(f), and the Book-Entry
Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any unpaid dividends and distributions or cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.6(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.6(f).

 



 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the

 



      
 

 



 

registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is not applicable.

 



 

(d) (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any surrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.6(f), in each
case until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. Following the surrender of a Certificate in accordance
with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof,
without interest, (A) promptly after such surrender, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and (B) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, holders of
Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
under this Article II shall be paid (A) at the time of payment of such Parent
Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.6(b), the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(f) and (B) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such
payment by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.6(b) and a payment date
subsequent to the time of such payment by the Exchange Agent under Section
2.6(b) payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(e) The Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.6(f) issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Ultimate
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for
Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no
dividends or other distributions

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to
any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each
former stockholder of the Company (and holders of Election Award Shares) who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive (taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
or Election Award Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder and rounded
to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) pursuant to Section
2.1(a) by (ii) the Parent Closing Price.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares nine months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Ultimate Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any
remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look
only to the Ultimate Surviving Entity, as general creditors thereof, for
payment of the Merger Consideration, any unpaid dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.6(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.6(f)
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws).

 



 

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Ultimate Surviving Entity,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock (or any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto or cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock) or cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent on a daily basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no
investment gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events
be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in
commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash in the Exchange
Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash
required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

 



 

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange

 



      
 

 



 

Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Ultimate Surviving Entity with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.6(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 2.6(f) had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article II.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Ultimate Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock, Company PBRSUs, Company
TBRSUs and Company Deferred Stock or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Ultimate Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, which amounts shall be withheld
first from the aggregate Cash Consideration with respect to such payment to
the extent applicable. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such
holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of
Company Common Stock of such holder shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-
Election Shares for all purposes of this Agreement, unless such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall thereafter otherwise make a timely Election under this
Agreement. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect
or has effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the
Merger after the Election Deadline, each of such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive Stock Consideration or
Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Parent in its
sole discretion. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by
the Company relating to rights to appraisal, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 2.9 _Election Award Proration_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.9 and Section 2.4, each
Election Award Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) Excluded Shares and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted into the right, at the election of such shares holder,
pursuant and subject to procedures established by the Company that are
separate but consistent with the election procedures set forth in Section 2.3
of this Agreement (the " _Election Award Procedures_ "), to receive any of the
following forms of consideration (the " _Election Award Merger Consideration_
"):

 



 

(i) for each Election Award Share with respect to which an election to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Award Election_ ") has been validly
made and not revoked pursuant to the Election Award Procedures (collectively,
the " _Stock Award Election Shares_ "), the right to receive from Parent the
Stock Consideration;

 



 

(ii) for each Election Award Share with respect to which an election to
receive cash consideration (a " _Cash Award Election_ ") has been validly made
and not revoked pursuant to the Election Award Procedures (collectively, the "
_Cash Award Election Shares_ "), the right to receive the Cash Consideration;
and

 



 

(iii) for each Election Award Share other than Election Award Shares for which
a Cash Award Election or Stock Award Election has been validly made and not
revoked pursuant to the Election Award Procedures (collectively, the " _Non-
Election Award Shares_ "), the right to receive from Parent such Stock
Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as is determined in accordance with
this Section 2.9.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of Election Award Shares to be converted into Cash Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.9 (the " _Cash Award Conversion Number_ ") shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Cash Award Component by (y)
the Per Share Amount. All other Election Award Shares shall be converted into
Stock Consideration.

 



 

(c) Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
effect, or shall cause to be effected, the allocation among the holders of
Election Award Shares of the rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the
Stock Consideration as follows:

 



 

(i) if the aggregate number of Election Award Shares with respect to which
Cash Award Elections shall have been made (the " _Total Cash Election Award
Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Award Conversion Number, then (A) all Stock Award
Election Shares and all Non-Election Award Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and (B) Cash Award Election Shares
of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Award Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Award Election
Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Cash Award Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash
Election Award Number (with the applicable party effecting the allocation to
determine, consistent with Section 2.2(a), whether fractions of Cash Award
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such

 



      
 

 



 

holders Cash Award Election Shares being converted into the right to receive
the Stock Consideration; and

 



 

(ii) if the Total Cash Election Award Number is less than the Cash Award
Conversion Number (the amount by which the Cash Award Conversion Number
exceeds the Total Cash Election Award Number being referred to herein as the "
_Shortfall Award Number_ "), then all Cash Award Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and the Stock
Award Election Shares and Non-Election Award Shares shall be treated in the
following manner:

 



 

(A) if the Shortfall Award Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Award Shares, then all Stock Award Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Award
Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Award Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Award
Shares held by such holder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Shortfall Award Number and the denominator of which is the total number of
Non-Election Award Shares (with the applicable party effecting the allocation
to determine, consistent with Section 2.2(a), whether fractions of Non-
Election Award Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holders Non-Election Award Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration; or

 



 

(B) if the Shortfall Award Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Award
Shares, then (1) all Non-Election Award Shares shall convert into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration and (2) all Stock Award Election Shares shall
convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that
number of Stock Award Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Stock Award Election Shares held by such holder
by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the
Shortfall Award Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Award
Shares, and the denominator of which is the total number of Stock Award
Election Shares (with the applicable party effecting the allocation to
determine, consistent with Section 2.2(a), whether fractions of Stock Award
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of
such holders Stock Award Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration.

have such power and authority or to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means with respect
to any Person, any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of

states of facts underlying a failure described in this clause (5) has resulted
in, or contributed to, or would reasonably be expected to result in or
contribute to, a Material Adverse Effect), (6) the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (7) any action or non-action expressly required to be taken

5.2, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, (4) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in
clause (x) or (y) below would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and (5) the Company has
provided at least four (4) Business Days notice to Parent of its intent to

Company may (x) furnish information to the Person making such Company

substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the Company than those set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (including in any standstill agreement
set forth therein); _provided_ , that any non-public information provided to
any such Person shall have been previously

 



      
 

 



 

provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently
with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract (each, an " _Company
Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is
intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions
(other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted by Section 5.2(b)).

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do
so would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2,
(x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (I) a
Company Superior Proposal or (II) a Company Intervening Event, or (y) solely
in response to a Company Superior Proposal received after the date hereof that
was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
5.2, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1(d)(iii) and concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Company Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement

(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the

Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new
four (4) Business Day period); and

 



       
 

 



 

(B) if the Parent makes a proposal during such four (4) Business Day period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Company
Superior Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement, as applicable, would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

 



 

 _provided further_ , that the Company Board may not make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event unless:

 



 

(1) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of it;

 



 

(2) the Company keeps Parent reasonably informed of developments with respect
to such Company Intervening Event;

 



 

(3) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Company Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor; and

 



 

(4) if Parent makes a proposal during such four (4) Business Day period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary
obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 



 

During the four (4) Business Day period prior to its effecting a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to
above, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any
indication by any Person that it is considering making a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or request for information, discussion or
negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a
Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any proposal or offer that is or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, in each case
together with the identity of the Person making any such indication, inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft
agreement provided by such Person. The Company shall keep Parent informed
(orally and in writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of the
status and details (including, within 24

 



      
 

 



 

hours after the occurrence of any amendment, modification, development,
discussion or negotiation) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal, request,
inquiry, proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of
any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any of the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Company
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.2(a), Section 5.2(b) and Section
5.2(c), and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in
such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

Section 5.2 by any Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

Agreement by the Company.

 



 

(f) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the

Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

 



 

(g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub I and their respective Affiliates) from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(or any similar provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case
unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii).

 



 

(h) (i) Nothing contained in Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing a position required by Rule 14e-2(a),
Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act and (ii) no disclosure that the Company Board may determine (after
consultation with counsel) that it or the Company is required to make under
applicable Law shall constitute a violation of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders
in favor of the approval of this Agreement in such disclosure.

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with

Person or having the effect of prohibiting Parent from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement); _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been previously provided to
the Company or shall be provided to the Company prior to or concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal regarding

Proposal, or

 



      
 

 



 

resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions (other than a

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Parent
Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may, if the Parent Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent
under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that may be offered by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3, (x)
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (I) a Parent
Superior Proposal or (II) a Parent Intervening Event, or (y) solely in

such Parent Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any)

Proposal shall require a new written notice by Parent and a new four (4)

to such Parent Intervening Event;

 



 

(3) Parent notifies the Company in writing at least four (4) Business Days

(4) if the Company makes a proposal during such four (4) Business Day period
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement

Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to
above, Parent shall, and shall cause its

development, discussion or negotiation) of any such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including furnishing copies of
any written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written
summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any
of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)

information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Parent
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(a), Section 5.3(b) or Section
5.3(c), and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in
such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

 



 

(e) Parent agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in Section
5.3 by any Representatives of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not such person is purporting to act on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by
Parent.

Act and (ii) no disclosure that the Parent Board may determine (after
consultation with counsel) that it or Parent is required to make under

_however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(d)(ii)) unless
the Parent Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its stockholders in
favor of the Parent Stock Issuance in such disclosure.

Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (i) Parent
and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement
(as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_
") to be sent to the stockholders of Parent relating to the special meeting of
Parents stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held to

cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_"), in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement. The Form
S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably
requested by such other party to be included therein. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such

securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. The Company
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders and Parents
stockholders, respectively, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by
Parent or the Company, as applicable, without providing the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the others prior
approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become effective or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of
the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any
state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
responses thereto. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not contain any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders
of the Company and Parent; _provided_ that the delivery of such notice and the
filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event more than five (5) Business
Days, after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, the
Company shall duly call and give notice of, and as promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than 30 days, after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting

related thereto. Except in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by Section 5.2(c), the Company, (A) through the Company
Board, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) include such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement; (B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval; and (C) through the Company Board, shall
publicly reaffirm within 72 hours its recommendation that the Company
stockholders adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby

publicly announced or distributed to the Companys stockholders and is
publically rejected by the Company Board, upon a request by Parent.

 



 

(c) The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ the Company

Company Stockholders Meeting for a period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days
after the date on which the original Company Stockholders Meeting was
scheduled to be held (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date) (i) if, as of the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) after consultation with
Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
would reasonably be expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the
distribution of any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement, (iii) after consultation with Parent to solicit additional proxies
if necessary to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, or (iv) if the
Company has delivered to Parent a bona fide notice contemplated by Section

Company Stockholders Meeting once for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days
after the date on which the original Company Stockholders Meeting was
scheduled to be held (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval. Once the Company has established a record
date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by applicable Law
or the Companys organizational documents. Without the prior written consent
of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the
Companys stockholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal or Company Superior Proposal or the making of any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable, but in no event more than five (5) Business
Days, after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
Parent shall duly call and give notice of, and as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than 30 days, after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and matters related
thereto. Except in the case of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by Section 5.3(c), in connection with the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, Parent, (A) through the Parent Board, shall (i)
recommend approval of the Parent Stock Issuance to the Parent stockholders and
(ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement; and (B) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(e) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that Parent
may, without the prior written consent of the Company adjourn or postpone the
Parent Stockholders Meeting for a period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days
after the date on which the original Parent Stockholders Meeting was scheduled
to be held (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days before the
Outside Date) (i) if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) after consultation with the Company, if the failure
to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be
expected to be a violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) after
consultation with the Company, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval or (iv) if Parent has delivered to the
Company a bona fide notice contemplated by Section 5.3(c). The Company may
require Parent to adjourn, delay or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting
once for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days after the date on which the
original Parent Stockholders Meeting was scheduled to be held (but prior to
the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Outside Date) to solicit
additional proxies necessary to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval. Once
Parent has established a record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
Parent shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of the
Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless
required to do so by applicable Law or Parents organizational documents.
Without the prior written consent of the Company, the approval of the Parent
Stock Issuance shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by Parents stockholders in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the
stockholders of Parent at the Parent Stockholders Meeting. Parent agrees that
its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Parent of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal or the
making of any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting
on the same date.

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of
such third party to provide such access or disclosure), (ii) to the extent
such disclosure would contravene applicable Law (including any fiduciary duty)

efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law (including any fiduciary duty)) or
(iii) that is subject to any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the
withholding party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

request by the other party therefor, provide to such other party the

deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or make
any other concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection
with obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of Parent. Each
of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating
to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall each have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult
with the other in connection with any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep
each other reasonably apprised of the

 



      
 

 



 

status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other written communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity
and/or third party with respect to such transactions, and, to the extent
practicable under the circumstances, shall permit the other to review in
advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other in
relation to) any proposed communication to a Governmental Entity and shall
provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in
any meeting or other communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) Parent shall be entitled, after consultation with the Company,
to make all strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner in which to
obtain any consents, waivers, and/or approvals, including, but not limited to
any decision to make any filing with any Governmental Entity, and (ii) Parent
and the Company may redact materials (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client
privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, and subject to the remainder of this
Section 5.6(b) and Section 5.6(c), Parent shall and, shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such
offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the
Effective Time, the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or
offer to commit to take any action (including any action that limits its
freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets, properties or services of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, the Ultimate Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries) which it is lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is
accepted, take or commit to take such action, in each case, as may be required
in order to enable the Closing to occur not later than the Outside Date (or if
such date is extended pursuant to the terms of Section 7.1(b)(i), the
Termination Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect
any such action that would (i) require or result in the sale, divestiture or
other direct or indirect disposition of any assets, businesses or rights of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any assets, business, or rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) limit Parents, the Companys or
any of their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain, contain, conduct, consolidate or otherwise
control, any of Parents or its Subsidiaries assets, rights or businesses, or
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries assets, rights or businesses, if such
sale, divestiture, disposition, or limitation, if agreed to, would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as a whole (after giving effect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall not, without the consent of Parent, publicly or before any Governmental
Entity or other third party, offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall
not commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
any sale, divestiture, disposition, prohibition or limitation or other action
of a type described in Section 5.6(b).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. The Company, Parent, the Company Board and the
Parent Board shall (a) take no action to cause any Takeover Law to become
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Second Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, the Second Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Merger, the Second Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Second Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) any other notice or communication from any Governmental Entity or
the NYSE in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) any
Action commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies of the Company or Parent available hereunder
and no information delivered pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall update any
section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter or
shall affect the representations or warranties of the parties hereunder.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub
I, the Surviving Corporation and the Ultimate Surviving Entity agrees that it
will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Laws, each present and former director and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or services performed by such Indemnified Parties at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Second Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Second Effective Time, including
the Mergers. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger Sub I, the Surviving
Corporation and the Ultimate Surviving Entity shall also pay expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnified Party in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 5.9 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company
Charter or the Company Bylaws and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
(or comparable organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub I agree
that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses

 



      
 

 



 

and exculpation of liabilities existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
in effect on the date of this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Second Effective Time shall be assumed and performed by the Ultimate
Surviving Entity and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Parent may
(i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , the Company may,
at its election, obtain prior to the Effective Time a "tail" policy with
respect to such directors and officers liability insurance with policy
limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to the directors and
officers covered under such insurance policy as the limits, terms and
conditions in the existing policies of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay
annual premiums for insurance under this Section 5.9(c) in excess of 300% of
the amount of the annual premiums paid by the Company for fiscal year 2014 for
such purpose (which fiscal year 2014 premiums are hereby represented and
warranted by the Company to be as set forth in Section 5.9(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter) (the aggregate amount of such annual premiums, the "
_Maximum Premium_ "), it being understood that Parent and the Company shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for
the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Company may at its
option purchase a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, in which case
Parents only obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9(c) shall be to maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder and Parent shall not be otherwise required under this
Section 5.9(c) to cause to be maintained in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company may not expend more than the Maximum Premium for such "tail"
policy.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Ultimate Surviving Entity or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent
or the Ultimate Surviving Entity assumes the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger,
and such other shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger,
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its officers or directors relating to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement.
The Company shall not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall give the Company the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder
litigation against Parent and/or its officers or directors relating to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement.
Parent shall not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any
stockholder litigation against Parent and/or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
without the Companys prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 5.12 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of the
Company and Parent shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock, on the one hand, and any shares of Parent Common
Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger, on the
other.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub
I, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any public announcement prior to such consultation and review,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. The initial press release of the parties
announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of
Parent and the Company in a form that is mutually agreed.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to each of the Effective Time and the
Second Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company or the Ultimate
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall take all such steps as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub I shall use its reasonable best
efforts (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to
take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the proceeds of
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any flex
provisions applicable thereto), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein or on other terms
not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Parent) and not in violation of this Section
5.15(a) (including clauses (A)-(C) below), (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed
advisable by Parent, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub I in the Debt Financing
Commitments that are within its control and otherwise comply with its
obligations thereunder and pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date,
(iii) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with the
terms thereof (except for amendments and supplements not prohibited by this
Section 5.15(a)) until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and
(iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments in the event of a
breach by any counterparty thereto that would reasonably be expected to
materially impede or delay the Closing. Parent shall have the right from time
to time to amend, supplement, amend and restate or modify the Debt Financing
Commitments; _provided_ , that any such amendment, supplement, amendment and
restatement or other modification shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Company (A) add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments
as in effect on the date hereof, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing Commitments (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments) in a manner that would adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or that would otherwise
be expected to delay or impede the Merger or (C) otherwise be reasonably
expected to (I) prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (II) make the funding
of the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments less
likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger Sub I to enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. For
the avoidance of doubt, but subject to the foregoing, Parent may amend,
supplement, amend and restate, modify or replace the Debt Financing
Commitments as in effect at the date hereof (x) to add or replace lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement
or (y) to increase the amount of Indebtedness contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments. For purposes of this Section 5.15, references to "
_Debt Financing_ " shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments as permitted to be amended, supplemented or modified by
this Section 5.15(a) (and, if applicable, shall include any Alternative
Financing used to satisfy the obligations under this Agreement) and references
to " _Debt Financing_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Commitments_ " shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or
modified by this Section 5.15(a) (and, if applicable, shall include any
commitments in respect of Alternative Financing). For the avoidance of doubt
and subject to the foregoing, the syndication of the Debt Financing to the
extent permitted by and conducted in accordance with the Debt Financing
Commitments as in effect on the date hereof shall not be deemed to violate
Parents obligations under this Agreement. Parent shall (X) give the Company
prompt oral and written notice of any material breach or default by any party
to the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing, in each case
of which Parent has become aware, and any purported termination or repudiation
by any party of the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing,
in each case of which Parent has become aware, or upon receipt of written
notice of any material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to
the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing and (Y) otherwise
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of Parents efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing upon Companys reasonable request. In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange
to obtain alternative financing (" _Alternative Financing_ ") from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the terms of such Alternative Financing do not expand upon the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters in effect on the
date of this Agreement or otherwise include terms (including any "flex"
provisions) that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period
of 20 consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout and at the
end of which (1) Parent shall have the Required Information (as defined below)
and (2) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 shall be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature will not
be satisfied until the Closing), and nothing has occurred and no condition
exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled
for any time during such 20 Business Day period; _provided_ , that (v) such 20
consecutive Business Day period shall either end on or prior to August 15,
2014 or, if such 20 consecutive business day period has not ended on or prior
to August 15, 2014, then such period shall commence no earlier than September
2, 2014; (w) none of November 26, 27 or 28, 2014, May 22 or 25, 2015 or July 3
or 6, 2015 shall constitute a business day in calculating the 20 consecutive
business day period and (x) such 20 consecutive business day period shall
either end on or prior to December 19, 2014 or, if such 20 consecutive
business day period has not ended on or prior to December 19, 2014, then such
period shall commence no earlier than January 5, 2015 (it being understood
that any period covering the dates described in clause (w) shall be deemed
consecutive for purposes of the foregoing); (y) the "Marketing Period" shall
not be deemed to have commenced (A) if, prior to the completion of the
Marketing Period, the Companys independent auditors shall have withdrawn its
audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements contained in the
Required Information, or (B) if the financial statements included in the
Required Information that are available to Parent on the first day of any such
20 Business Day period would not be sufficiently current on any day during
such period to permit (x) a registration statement using such financial
statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such period
(it being understood that the foregoing shall not require the

 



      
 

 



 

Required Information to comply at any time with Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule
3-16 of Regulation S-X, or to include Compensation Disclosure and Analysis
required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or other information customarily
excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum, including subsidiary financial
statements) and (y) the Companys independent auditors to issue a customary
comfort letter (in accordance with its normal practices and procedures) or (C)
the Required Information during such time period contains any untrue statement
of material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements contained therein not misleading, and (z) the Marketing
Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which the Debt
Financing is consummated.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives, to provide to Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub I and the
Debt Financing Sources all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or the
Debt Financing Sources that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection
with the Debt Financing (which term shall include, solely for purposes of this
Section 5.15(b), the New Notes) ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing:

on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and

under Rule 144A under the Securities Act), bank information memoranda,
business projections, lender and investor presentations, prospectuses and
similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing and the New

the last three fiscal years ended at least 90 days prior to the Closing Date

the date hereof (limited in the case of fiscal quarters after the fiscal
quarter ended June 30, 2014 to those ended at least 45 days prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing Date and in the case of fiscal years to those ended at least 90
days prior to the Closing Date) and related consolidated pro forma statements
of income and cash flows of Parent for the prior twelve month period ending on
the relevant fiscal quarter or year-end; _provided_ that the Required
Information shall not include (1) subsidiary financial statements required by
Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, Compensation Disclosure
and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or other information
customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering memorandum or (2) any post-
Closing or pro forma financial information, including post-Closing or pro
forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership, or other post-
Closing pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information
used in connection with the Debt Financing (all such information in this
clause (iii)(A), the " _Required Information_ ") and (B) using reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide Parent and the Financing Sources and their
respective agents with such other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent to prepare customary
bank information memoranda, lender presentations, offering memoranda and
private placement memoranda (including under Rule 144A under the Securities
Act and subject to customary exceptions for offerings under Rule 144A and
private placements) including such other information and data as are otherwise
reasonably necessary in order to receive customary "comfort" letters with
respect to the financial statements and data referred to in clause (A), and
other materials in connection with a syndicated bank financing or other debt
offering in connection with such Debt Financing and the New Notes (including
information reasonably requested by Parent so as to permit Parent to prepare
the forecasts contemplated by the Commitment Letter) (it being understood that
the Company will have no obligation to (1) prepare subsidiary financial
statements required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or
Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or
(2) without limiting the Companys obligation under subsection (b)(ii) above
to reasonably assist Parent in Parents preparation of pro forma financial
statements, including providing any reasonably requested historical financial
information, prepare any post-Closing or pro forma financial information),

 



 

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining accountants
comfort letters and consents to the use of accountants audit reports relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries,

 



 

(v) using reasonable best efforts to, if requested by Parent, facilitate the
obtaining of appraisals, surveys, title insurance and other documentation and
items required by the Debt Financing Commitments and relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries,

 



 

(vi) facilitating the execution and delivery, as of the Effective Time (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, not prior thereto), of any definitive financing

documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and
other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection
with the pay-off or redemption of existing Indebtedness (including any
Indebtedness under the Existing Company Credit Facilities and the Existing
Company Notes) and the release of related Liens), and the replacement or
backing of any

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding letter of credit maintained or provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries effective as of the Closing Date,

 



 

(vii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels and
approvals in connection with the Debt Financing from other parties to material

the Company is a party and to arrange discussions among Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub I and their Debt Financing Sources with other parties to material
leases, encumbrances and contracts, and

 



 

(viii) taking all corporate actions necessary to permit the consummation of
the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof, to be made available to
Parent on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger.

 



 

Regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, Parent shall (i) indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates from and
against any liability or obligation suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing or the
Repurchase and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries provided
by the Company in writing specifically for use in the Debt Financing offering
documents or in any documentation related to the Repurchase) and (ii) promptly
upon the Companys request, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 5.15, in each
case, other than to the extent any of the foregoing arise from the willful
misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective
affiliates and representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to pass resolutions or consents
to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, other than
resolutions or consents of the Subsidiaries (but not of the Company) adopted
at the Closing, and (2) no obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof
under any certificate, document or instrument (other than the customary
representation letters referred to above) executed pursuant to the foregoing
shall be effective until the Closing. If the Company at any point believes
that it has delivered the Required Information in accordance with this Section
5.15(b), it may deliver to Parent a written notice to such effect, in which
case the Company shall be deemed to have delivered the Required Information
unless Parent shall provide to the Company within five (5) Business Days a
written notice describing in reasonable detail the information constituting
Required Information that the Company has not delivered. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Parent may make a change of control offer prior to the Closing Date to
repurchase all outstanding Existing Company Notes on the Closing Date pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of the Indentures (the " _Repurchase_ ")
and in accordance with applicable law. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection
with the Repurchase ( _provided_ that such assistance shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries). Parent shall send notice of the offer to repurchase the
Existing Company Notes in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with the terms of the Indentures in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company, on a date on or after the date of termination or expiration of
all waiting periods applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act, it being
understood and agreed that such offer to Repurchase shall be made contingent
on the occurrence of the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary on its part under applicable Law and the rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Ultimate Surviving Entity
of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of
the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Post-Closing Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time and through December 31, 2015 (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent will provide, or will cause its applicable Subsidiary to
provide, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues
employment with Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (each such employee, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") (i) 401(k) matching contributions that are no less
favorable to the Continuing Employee than those in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) medical benefits (including the in-network
doctors that are available under the Company Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time) that are no less favorable to the Continuing
Employee than those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except
as set forth in the following sentence, Parent will use commercially
reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies, provide Continuing Employees
with credit for all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries as if such
service were with Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual under Parents
employee benefit and compensation plans to the same extent that such service
was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Outside the U.S., Continuing Employees shall be given credit for service with
the Company or its Subsidiaries solely as required by applicable law. Unused
vacation days accrued by Continuing Employees under the plans and policies of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall carry over to Parent or the Ultimate
Surviving Entity. This Section 5.17(a) shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit provided to any employee, require Parent to continue in effect any
specific Company Plan or Parent employee benefit plan, or prohibit the
termination of any specific employee, following the Effective Time. Other than
as specified above in this Section 5.17(a), Parents present intention is to
provide comparable compensation and employee benefit programs to Continuing
Employees from the Effective Time through the Continuation Period; provided
that such programs shall be adjusted as Parent deems necessary.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and without limiting the generality of
Section 5.17(a), with respect to any health plan (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes medical, dental, vision and prescription drug) of Parent and
its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to
participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall
cause its applicable Subsidiary to, (i) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or

 



      
 

 



 

eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived
with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
recognize any healthcare expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee in the
year that includes the Effective Time (or, if later, the year in which such
Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate in the Parent or
Subsidiary health plan) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual
out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health plan of Parent or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them. This Section 5.17 shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this Section 5.17, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 5.17.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Tax Certificates_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger Sub I hereby agrees to deliver certificates substantially in compliance
with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the tax opinions required
by Section 6.2(f) and Section 6.3(d), which certificates shall be effective as
of the date of such tax opinions.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Governance Matters_. Parent shall take all necessary action to
cause, effective as of the Effective Time, two (2persons (the "Continuing
Directors") who were members of the Company Board immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be elected to the Parent Board, with each Continuing
Director to be elected to a different class on the Parent Board. The Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Lead Independent Director
of the Company Board, on the one hand, and the Chairman of the Nominating,
Governance and Risk Committee of the Parent Board, the Lead Independent
Director of the Parent Board and the Chief Executive Officer of Parent on the
other hand shall meet within 45 days of the date of this Agreement to develop
mutually agreed qualifications for the Continuing Directors. The election of
any such Continuing Directors shall be subject to the approval and related

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (x) by Parent pursuant to

the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) [ _Parent Breach_ ] under
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section

party and its Affiliates for all of their reasonable, documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including all reasonable, documented fees and expenses of
its Representatives) incurred by the terminating party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, investigation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "), up to a maximum amount
of $40 million; _provided_ , that the payment by the Company or Parent, as
applicable, of the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this Section 7.3(d), (i)
shall not relieve the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b) or 7.3(c),
except to the extent indicated in such Section and (ii) shall not relieve the
Company or Parent, as applicable, from any liability or damage resulting from
a willful and material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud and shall not
limit or otherwise affect Parents or the Companys rights to specific

(e) Payment of the Termination Fee or Financing Failure Fee, as applicable,
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the accounts designated by
the party entitled to receive such Termination Fee or Financing Failure Fee,
as applicable, (i) on the earliest of the execution of a definitive agreement
with respect to, submission to the stockholders of, or consummation of, any
transaction contemplated by a Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, in the case of a Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i) or 7.3(c)(i), as applicable, (ii) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days thereof), in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to
Section 7.3(b)(ii) or 7.3(c)(ii), as applicable, (iii) simultaneously with,
and as a condition to the effectiveness of, termination, in the case of a
Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(iii) or 7.3(c)(iii), as
applicable, or (iv) as promptly as practicable after termination of this
Agreement by the Company (and in any event within two (2) Business Days
thereof) in the case of a Financing Failure Fee payable pursuant to Section
7.3(c)(iv). Payment of the Expense Reimbursement to the terminating party
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the accounts designated by
the terminating party within two (2) Business Days after the terminating party

(f) The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and

 



      
 

 



 

that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as applicable fails
promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the owed party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the owing party for the amounts set forth in this Section
7.3, the owing party shall pay to the owed party its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that each of the Expense Reimbursement, the Termination Fee and
the Financing Failure Fee is not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate a party in the circumstances in
which such Expense Reimbursement, the Termination Fee or the Financing Failure
Fee is due and payable, as the case may be, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) (1) none of the Parent Parties or Debt Financing Sources (in each case
except Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub I or any of their Subsidiaries) shall
have any liability to the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives (including without limitation their direct or
indirect stockholders), and (2) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or
any of their respective Representatives (including, without limitation, their
direct or indirect stockholders) shall have any liability to the Debt
Financing Sources or any of their Affiliates (except Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger Sub I or any of their Subsidiaries), in each case for any claim for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach or termination of this Agreement, the

consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be limited to $140 million plus
any amounts payable under Section 7.3(f) (inclusive of the Termination Fee and
Expense Reimbursement, as applicable); _provided_ , _however_ , that solely in
the event of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(iv) such amount shall be $240 million plus any amounts payable
under Section 7.3(f) (inclusive of the Financing Failure Fee); and

 



 

(iii) without limiting the right of Parent to seek specific performance in
accordance with Section 8.10, the maximum aggregate liability of the Company
for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Commitments or the

 



      
 

 



 

Debt Financing (except for any willful and material breach or fraud), or the
failure of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby
to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to
be have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be limited to $140 million plus
any amounts payable under Section 7.3(f) (inclusive of the Termination Fee and

the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered

the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein; _provided_
, _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, has been obtained, no waiver may be made
that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the

approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and
delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or
delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such

assignment or (b) after the Effective Time, any Person; _provided further_
that Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub I may assign all or a portion of their
respective rights hereunder to any Debt Financing Source, including, without
limitation, any agent or other representative thereof, as collateral security
for obligations thereto in respect of the Debt Financing, including any
refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals thereof without the consent
of Company, but any such assignment shall not relieve Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger Sub I of their respective obligations under this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly,
prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 and subject
to Section 8.10(b), the parties acknowledge and agree that

 



      
 

 



 

each party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not then available in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (i) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(ii) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall not be entitled to specifically enforce the respective obligations of
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub I, to conduct the Closing or cause the Merger
to be consummated if the Debt Financing or, if applicable, any Alternative
Financing, is not available in an amount sufficient to permit Parent to
consummate the Merger on the date that would otherwise have been the Closing
Date (it being understood that the Company shall, prior to the termination of
this Agreement, be entitled to seek specific performance of Parents
obligations in Section 5.15 of this Agreement to seek to obtain the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing).

 



 

Section 8.11 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENTS, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Facsimile or .pdf Signature_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute
an original for all purposes.

 



 

Section 8.16 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub, Merger Sub I and the Company acknowledges that each party to this
Agreement has been

 



      
 

 



 

represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.
