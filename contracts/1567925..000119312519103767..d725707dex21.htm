Class A Common Stock. REIT I or REIT II, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local Tax laws with
respect to the lapsing of any restrictions on Restricted REIT I Share Awards
pursuant to this  _Section 3.2(a)_.

(b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, REIT II and the REIT II Board, and
REIT I and the REIT I Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
(including obtaining consents or providing any required or advisable notices)
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.2(b)_.

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures; Distributions with
Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, REIT II shall appoint DST Systems,
Inc. as the exchange agent (or any successor exchange agent for REIT II) (the
" _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as the agent for the purpose of paying the Merger
Consideration for the Book-Entry Shares. At or promptly following the Merger
Effective Time, REIT II shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of REIT I Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article 3_ , (i) Book-Entry Shares representing shares
of REIT II Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(i)_
equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration and (ii) immediately available
funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In
addition to the foregoing, after the Merger Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if

 



14

    

 applicable, REIT II shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the
Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of
REIT II Common Stock, with both a record and payment date after the Merger
Effective Time and prior to the surrender of the REIT I Common Stock in
exchange for the Stock Consideration, pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, such
dividends or other distributions shall be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund. REIT II shall cause the Exchange Agent to, and the Exchange Agent shall,
make delivery of, the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by REIT II; provided, such investments shall be in
(i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, (iii) certificates of deposit maturing not
more than 180 days after the date of purchase issued by a bank organized under
the Laws of the United States or any state thereof having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $3,000,000,000 or (iv) a money market fund having
assets of at least $1,000,000,000. Interest and other income on the Exchange
Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of REIT II and shall be paid to
REIT II, as REIT II directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve
REIT II or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article 3_ , and following any losses from any such investment, REIT II shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
necessary to satisfy REIT IIs obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
holders of shares of REIT I Common Stock at the Merger Effective Time, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Merger Effective Time (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), REIT II shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to
each holder of record of a Book-Entry Share representing shares of REIT I
Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in
customary form as prepared by REIT II and reasonably acceptable to the REIT I
Special Committee (which shall specify, among other things, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the transfer of
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the
number of shares of REIT I Common Stock previously represented by such Book-
Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) Upon (A) transfer of any Book-Entry Share representing shares of REIT
I Common Stock to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal or (B) receipt of an "agents message"
by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of transfer of a Book-
Entry Share, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Share representing shares of
REIT I Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the
Merger Consideration into which such shares of REIT I Common Stock shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) certain dividends and
distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_, if any, after the
Exchange Agents receipt of such transferred Book-Entry Share or "agents
message" or other evidence, and the Book-Entry Share so transferred, as
applicable, shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. Until transferred as
contemplated by this  _Section 3.3_, each Book-Entry Share representing
shares of REIT I Common Stock shall be deemed, at any time after the Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article 3_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Book-Entry Shares
on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Merger
Effective Time with respect to REIT II Common Stock with a record date after
the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of
the Merger to receive Book-Entry Shares representing REIT II Common Stock and
no cash payment shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_ until such holder shall have transferred its

 



15

    

 Book-Entry Share pursuant to this _Section 3.3_. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Book-Entry Shares, such holder shall be paid,
in each case, without interest, (i) the amount of any dividends or other
distributions theretofore paid with respect to the shares of REIT II Class A
Common Stock represented by the Book-Entry Shares received by such holder and
having a record date on or after the Merger Effective Time and a payment date
prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such shares of REIT II Class A Common
Stock and having a record date on or after the Merger Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date on or after such surrender.

 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of REIT I Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of REIT I, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Book-Entry Share transferred in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.3_ shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Book-Entry Share transferred, or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of REIT II that such Tax either has been paid or
is not applicable.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of REIT I Common Stock for six (6) months after the Merger Effective
Time shall be delivered to REIT II upon demand, and any former holders of REIT
I Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to REIT II for payment of their
claims with respect thereto.

 

(g) None of the REIT I Parties, the REIT II Parties, the Surviving Entity,
the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of
such entities, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Merger
Consideration if the Exchange Fund (or the appropriate portion thereof) has
been delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of any shares of REIT I Common Stock immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of REIT II free and clear of any claims or interest of
such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each and any REIT I Party, REIT II
Party, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of REIT I
Common Stock, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid
over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable Law and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

Section 3.5 _Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.6 _General Effects of the Merger_. At the Merger Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as set forth in this Agreement, the
Articles of Merger, and as provided in the applicable provisions of the MGCL
and the MLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Merger Effective Time, all of the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of REIT I and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of REIT I and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

timely basis. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the REIT
I Parties do not, and the performance of this Agreement and their obligations
hereunder will not, (i) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default

which such adjustments are not, in the aggregate, material to REIT I)
and (iv) fairly present, or will fairly present, as the case may be, in all
material respects (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, for
normal and recurring year-end adjustments, none of which is material), the
consolidated financial position of REIT I and the REIT I Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as of their respective dates and each of the consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of REIT I and
the REIT I Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein. There are no
internal investigations, any SEC inquiries or investigations or other
governmental inquiries or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of REIT
I, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of REIT I.

(e) Since December 31, 2016, (A) REIT I has designed and maintained
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are effective to ensure that

 



21

    

 material information required to be disclosed by REIT I in the reports that
it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated to REIT Is management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of REIT I required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports, and (B) such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting REIT Is management to material information required to
be included in REIT Is periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.
REIT I and REIT I Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
(i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,
(iii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (iv) that access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, (v) that the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences and (vi) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. REIT I has disclosed to REIT Is auditors and audit committee
(1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect REIT Is ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
control over financial reporting.

 

(f) REIT I is not and none of the REIT I Subsidiaries are, a party to, and
none of REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
or arrangement, including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among REIT I and any REIT I Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or effect is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, REIT I, any REIT I Subsidiary or REIT
Is or such REIT I Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other REIT I
SEC Documents.

 

(g) Neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary is required to be registered
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

(h) REIT I, REIT I Subsidiaries and their controlled Affiliates (including
in each case any of their officers, directors or employees) have complied
with the Anti-Corruption Law. Neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary and
their controlled Affiliates nor, to the Knowledge of REIT I, any director,
officer or Representative of REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary has (i) used any
corporate funds for any unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other
unlawful expenses related to political activity, (ii) made, taken or will take
any action in furtherance of any direct or indirect unlawful payment, promise
to pay or authorization or approval of the payment or giving of money,
property or gifts of anything of value, directly or indirectly to any foreign
or domestic government official or employee, (iii) made, offered or taken an
act in furtherance of any direct or indirect unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff,
kickback or other unlawful payment to any foreign or domestic government
official or employee, (iv) made any payment to any customer, supplier
or tenant, or to any officer, director, partner, employee or agent of any
such customer, supplier or tenant, for the unlawful sharing of fees to any
such customer, supplier or tenant or any such officer, director, partner,
employee or agent for the unlawful rebating of charges, (v) engaged in any
other unlawful reciprocal practice, or made any other unlawful payment or
given any other unlawful consideration to any such customer, supplier or
tenant or any such officer, director, partner, employee or agent of such
customer, officer or tenant, or (vi) taken any action or made any omission in
violation of any applicable Law governing imports into or exports from the
United States or any foreign country, or relating to economic sanctions or
embargoes, corrupt practices, money laundering, or compliance with

 



22

    

 unsanctioned foreign boycotts, in each case, in violation in any material
respect of any applicable Anti-Corruption Law. Neither REIT I nor any REIT I
Subsidiary has received any written communication that alleges that REIT I or
any REIT I Subsidiary, or any of their respective Representatives, is, or may
be, in violation of, or has, or may have, any liability under, any Anti-
Corruption Law.

 

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31,
2018 through the date of this Agreement, (a) REIT I and each REIT I
Subsidiary has conducted its business in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (b) neither REIT I nor any

Effect or any event, circumstance, change, effect, development, condition or
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with all other events,
circumstances, changes, effects, developments, conditions or occurrences,
would reasonably be expected to have a REIT I Material Adverse Effect.

December 31, 2018 (including the notes thereto), (b) for liabilities or
obligations incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (c) for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2018,
neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that either alone or
when combined with all other liabilities of a type not described in clauses
(a), (b) or (c) above, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
REIT I Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.8 _Permits; Compliance with Law_.

 

(a) Except for the authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and
clearances that are the subject of _Section 4.10_ and _Section 4.11_, which
are addressed solely in those Sections, REIT I and each REIT I Subsidiary is
in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises, certifications and
clearances of any Governmental Authority (" _Permits_ ") necessary for REIT I
and each REIT I Subsidiary to own, lease and, to the extent applicable,
operate its properties or to carry on its respective business substantially as
they are being conducted as of the date hereof (the " _REIT I Permits_ "), and
all such REIT I Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where
the failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full
force and effect of, any of the REIT I Permits, individually, or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a REIT I Material
Adverse Effect. REIT I has paid all fees and assessments due and payable, in
each case, in connection with all such Permits. No event has occurred with
respect to any of the REIT I Permits which permits, or after notice or lapse
of time or both would permit, revocation or termination thereof or would
result in any other material impairment of the rights of the holder of any
such REIT I Permits. Neither REIT I nor any of the REIT I Subsidiaries has
received any notice indicating, nor to the Knowledge of REIT I, is there any
pending applicable petition, objection or other pleading with any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction or authority over the operations of REIT I or
the REIT I Subsidiaries that impairs the validity of any REIT I Permit or
which would reasonably be expected, if accepted or granted, to result in the
revocation of any REIT I Permit, except where the impairment or revocation of
any such REIT I Permits, individually, or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a REIT I Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary is, and for the past three
(3) years has been, in conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any
Law applicable to REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary or by which any property or

Permits (except for the REIT I Permits addressed in _Section 4.10_ or
_Section 4.11_ and which are solely addressed in those Sections), except, in
each case, for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a REIT I
Material Adverse Effect.

 



23

    

Section 4.9 _Litigation_. There is no material action, suit, proceeding
or investigation to which REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary is a party (either
as plaintiff or defendant) pending or, to the Knowledge of REIT I, threatened
before any Governmental Authority, and, to the Knowledge of REIT I, there
is no basis for any such action, suit, proceeding or investigation. Neither
REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary has been permanently or temporarily enjoined
by any Order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority from engaging
in or continuing to conduct the business of REIT I or the REIT I
Subsidiaries. No Order of any Governmental Authority has been issued in any
proceeding to which REIT I or any of the REIT I Subsidiaries is or was a
party, or, to the Knowledge of REIT I, in any other proceeding, that enjoins
or requires REIT I or any of the REIT I Subsidiaries to take action of any
kind with respect to its businesses, assets or properties. Except as set forth
at _Section 4.9_ of the REIT I Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2016,
none of REIT I, any REIT I Subsidiary or any Representative of the foregoing
has received or made any settlement offer for any material Action to which
REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary is a party or potentially could be a
party (in each case, either as plaintiff or defendant), other than written
settlement offers that do not exceed $1,000,000 individually.

The REIT I Parties and each other REIT I Subsidiary has performed all
obligations required to be performed by it prior to the date hereof under each
REIT I Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of REIT I, each other party
thereto has performed all obligations required to be performed by it under
such REIT I Material Contract prior to the date hereof. None of the REIT I
Parties or any other REIT I Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge of REIT I, any
other party thereto, is in breach or violation of, or default under, any REIT
I Material Contract, and no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a violation, breach or default under any REIT I
Material Contract, except where in each case such breach, violation or

have a REIT I Material Adverse Effect. None of the REIT I Parties or any other
REIT I Subsidiary has received notice of any violation or default under, or

True, correct and complete copies of all REIT I Material Contracts have been
made available to REIT II. Since January 1, 2016, and as of the date
hereof, neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary has received any written
notice of the intention of any party to cancel, terminate, materially change
the scope of rights under or fail to renew any REIT I Material Contract.

 

Section 4.13 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each REIT I Party and each other REIT I Subsidiary has timely filed
with the appropriate Governmental Authority all United States federal income
Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and
all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. Each
REIT I Party and each other REIT I Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been
paid on their behalf), or made adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP
for, all material Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on
any Tax Return. True and materially complete copies of all United States
federal income Tax Returns that have been filed with the IRS by REIT I and
each REIT I Subsidiary with respect to the taxable years ending on or after
REIT Is formation have been made available to REIT II. No written claim has
been proposed by any Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction where REIT I
or any REIT I Subsidiary do not file Tax Returns that REIT I or any REIT I
Subsidiary is or may be subject to Tax by such jurisdiction.

(b) Beginning with its initial taxable year ending on December 31, 2011,
and through and including the Closing Date (determined as if REIT Is current
taxable year ended immediately prior to Closing), REIT I (i) has been
organized and operated in conformity with the requirements to qualify as a
REIT under the Code and the current and proposed method of operation for REIT
I is expected to enable REIT I to continue to meet the requirements for
qualification as a REIT through and including the Closing Date, and (ii) has
not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to
result in REIT Is failure to qualify as a REIT, and no challenge to REIT Is
status as a REIT is pending or threatened in writing. No REIT I Subsidiary is
a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, other than a
corporation that qualifies as a Qualified

 



27

    

 REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. REIT Is dividends paid
deduction, within the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable
year, taking into account any dividends subject to Sections 857(b)(8) or 858
of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (i) REIT Is REIT taxable
income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined without regard
to any dividends paid deduction for such year and (ii) REIT Is net capital
gain for such year.

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority
or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of REIT I, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of REIT I or any REIT I
Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of REIT I or any REIT I
Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the
Knowledge of REIT I, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which
deficiency has not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which are
being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
REIT I Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any material
Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv) neither REIT I nor
any REIT I Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time
within which to file any material Tax Return; and (v) neither REIT I nor any
REIT I Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign income Tax Law).

(d) Each REIT I Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or
limited liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for United States federal
income tax purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and not as a corporation, an association
taxable as a corporation whose separate existence is respected for federal
income tax purposes, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code.

 

(e) Neither REIT I nor any REIT I Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-7, nor have they disposed of any such asset during its current
taxable year.

(f)  Since its inception, REIT I and the REIT I Subsidiaries have not
incurred (i) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, (ii) any
liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test violations),
856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of
other qualification requirements applicable to REITs) and (iii) REIT I has
not, and none of the REIT I Subsidiaries have, incurred any material liability
for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with
sales of property. No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of REIT I no
condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any
material liability for Taxes described clause (iii) of the preceding sentence
or any liability for Taxes described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding
sentence will be imposed upon REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary.

(g)  REIT I and the REIT I Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442,
1445, 1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and
foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid
over to the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be
so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

(h) There are no REIT I Tax Protection Agreements (as hereinafter
defined) in force at the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, no person has raised in writing, or to the Knowledge of REIT I
threatened to raise, a material claim against REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary
for any breach of any REIT I Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, "
_REIT I Tax Protection Agreements_ " means any written agreement

 



28

    

 to which REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary is a party pursuant to which: (i)
any liability to holders of limited partnership interests in a REIT I
Subsidiary Partnership (as hereinafter defined) relating to Taxes may arise,
whether or not as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and/or (ii) in connection with the deferral of
income Taxes of a holder of limited partnership interests or limited

Parties, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the REIT I
Parties, constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the REIT II
Parties enforceable against the REIT II Parties in accordance with its terms,

it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated to REIT IIs management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief

 



37

    

 Financial Officer of REIT II required under the Exchange Act with respect to
such reports, and (B) such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting REIT IIs management to material information required to be
included in REIT IIs periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. REIT
II and REIT II Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,

financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (iv) that access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization, (v) that the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences and (vi) accounts, notes and
other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. REIT II has disclosed to REIT IIs auditors and
audit committee (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect REIT IIs ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal control over financial reporting.

(f) REIT II is not, and none of the REIT II Subsidiaries are, a party to,
and none of REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary has any commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract or arrangement, including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among REIT II and any REIT II Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or effect is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, REIT II, any REIT II Subsidiary or REIT
IIs or such REIT II Subsidiarys audited financial statements or other REIT
II SEC Documents.

 

(g) Neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary is required to be
registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

(h) REIT II, REIT II Subsidiaries and their controlled Affiliates
(including in each case any of their officers, directors or employees) have

made, offered or taken an act in furtherance of any direct or indirect
unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff, kickback or other unlawful payment to any
foreign or domestic government official or employee, (iv) made any payment to
any customer, supplier or tenant, or to any officer, director, partner,
employee or agent of any such customer, supplier or tenant, for the unlawful
sharing of fees to any such customer, supplier or tenant or any such officer,
director, partner, employee or agent for the unlawful rebating of charges,
(v) engaged in any other unlawful reciprocal practice, or made any other
unlawful payment or given any other unlawful consideration to any such
customer, supplier or tenant or any such officer, director, partner, employee
or agent of such customer, officer or tenant, or (vi) taken any action or made
any omission in violation of any applicable Law governing imports into or
exports from the United States or any foreign country, or relating to
economic sanctions or embargoes, corrupt practices, money laundering, or
compliance with unsanctioned foreign boycotts, in each case, in violation in
any material respect of any applicable Anti-Corruption Law. Neither REIT II
nor any REIT II Subsidiary has received any written communication that
alleges that REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary, or any of their respective
Representatives, is, or may be, in violation of, or has, or may have, any
liability under, any Anti-Corruption Law.

REIT II Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force

reasonably be expected, if accepted or granted, to result in the revocation of

REIT II Material Adverse Effect.

investigation to which REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary is a party (either

before any Governmental Authority, and, to the Knowledge of REIT II, there is

or properties. Since January 1, 2016, none of REIT II, any REIT II Subsidiary

regard, however, to the distribution requirement described in Section 857(a)
of the Code with respect to the taxable year, including the Closing, and (ii)
has not taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected
to result in REIT IIs failure to qualify as a REIT, and no challenge to REIT
IIs status as a REIT is pending or threatened in writing. No REIT II
Subsidiary is a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes,
other than a corporation that qualifies as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as
a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. REIT IIs dividends paid deduction, within the
meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable year (other than the
taxable year, 

 



43

    

 including the Closing), taking into account any dividends subject to
Sections 857(b)(8) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the sum of (i)
REIT IIs REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code,
determined without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such year and
(ii) REIT IIs net capital gain for such year.

 

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority
or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of REIT II, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of REIT II or any REIT II
Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of REIT II or any REIT II
Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the
Knowledge of REIT II, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which
deficiency has not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which are
being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
REIT II Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither REIT II nor any REIT II
Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect
to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year; (iv)
neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return; and (v)
neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary has entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law). 

(d) Each REIT II Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or
limited liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary has been since its formation treated for United States federal
income tax purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and not as a corporation, an association
taxable as a corporation whose separate existence is respected for federal
income tax purposes, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code.

(e) Neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-7, nor have they disposed of any such asset during its current
taxable year.

 

(f) Since its inception, REIT II and the REIT II Subsidiaries have not
incurred (i) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, (ii) any
liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test violations),
856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of
other qualification requirements applicable to REITs) and (iii) REIT II has
not, and none of the REIT II Subsidiaries have, incurred any material
liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer or similar Taxes arising in
connection with sales of property. No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge
of REIT II no condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material
risk that any material liability for Taxes described clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence or any liability for Taxes described in clause (i) or (ii)
of the preceding sentence will be imposed upon REIT II or any REIT II
Subsidiary.

 

(g) REIT II and the REIT II Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445,
1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign
Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to
the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

 

(h) There are no REIT II Tax Protection Agreements (as hereinafter
defined) in force at the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, no person has raised in writing, or to the Knowledge of REIT II
threatened to raise, a material claim against REIT II or any REIT II
Subsidiary for any breach of any REIT II Tax Protection Agreements. As

agreement to which REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary is a party pursuant to
which: (i) any liability to holders of 

 



44

    

 limited partnership interests in a REIT II Subsidiary Partnership (as
hereinafter defined) relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and/or (ii) in connection with the deferral of income Taxes of a holder of
limited partnership interests or limited liability company in a REIT II
Subsidiary Partnership, REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary has agreed to (A)
maintain a minimum level of debt, continue a particular debt or provide rights
to guarantee debt, (B) retain or not dispose of assets, (C) make or refrain
from making Tax elections, and/or (D) only dispose of assets in a particular
manner. As used herein, " _REIT II Subsidiary Partnership_ " means a REIT II
Subsidiary that is a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes.

 

(i) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of REIT II or any
REIT II Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 

(j) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary,
and after the Closing Date neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary shall be
bound by any such Tax allocation agreements or similar arrangements or have
any liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the
Closing Date.

(k) Except as set forth in _Section 5.13(k)_ of the REIT I Disclosure
Letter, neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary has requested or received

Governmental Authority.

under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or
otherwise.

(m)  Neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary has participated in any
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b).

 

(n) Neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(o) No written power of attorney that has been granted by REIT II or any
REIT II Subsidiary (other than to REIT II or a REIT II Subsidiary) currently
is in force with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

(p)  Neither REIT II nor any REIT II Subsidiary has taken any action or
failed to take any action which action or failure would reasonably be expected
to jeopardize, nor to the Knowledge of REIT II, is there any other fact
or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent, the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 

(q) REIT II is a "domestically controlled qualified investment entity"
within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.

Effect, (i) no Intellectual Property used by REIT II or any REIT II
Subsidiary infringes or is alleged to infringe any Intellectual Property
rights of any third party, (ii) no Person is misappropriating, infringing or
otherwise violating any Intellectual Property of REIT II or any REIT II
Subsidiary, (iii) REIT II and the REIT II Subsidiaries own or are licensed to
use, or otherwise possess valid rights to use, all Intellectual Property
necessary to conduct the business of REIT II and the REIT II Subsidiaries as
it is currently conducted. Since January 1, 2018, neither REIT II nor any
REIT II Subsidiary has received any written or, to the Knowledge of REIT II
verbal, complaint, claim or notice alleging misappropriation, infringement or
violation of any Intellectual Property rights of any third party.

Section 5.15 _Insurance_. REIT II and each REIT II Subsidiary maintain
material policies of insurance and material fidelity bonds as set forth in

II Insurance Policies_ "). All such insurance policies are in full force and
effect, and, as of the date hereof, no written notice of cancellation or
termination has been received by REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiary
with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially
similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation, and there is no existing
default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a breach or default, by any insured thereunder, or permit
termination or modification, of any of the policies, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a REIT II
Material Adverse Effect. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a REIT II Material Adverse Effect, all

been paid, and REIT II and the REIT II Subsidiaries have otherwise complied
in all material respects with the terms and conditions of all REIT II
Insurance Policies.

 

Section 5.16 _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Other than the REIT II Equity Incentive Plan, REIT II and the REIT II
Subsidiaries do not and are not required to, and have not and have never been
required to, maintain, sponsor or contribute to any Benefit Plans. Neither

Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to REIT II. REIT II

Affiliates, should be discovered by REIT I or REIT II which, in the reasonable
judgment of REIT I or REIT II, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a

copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state

conferences with the other Parties and their Representatives prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, prior to the Stockholders Meeting and at such

obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Parties shall be required by this  _Section 7.2(a)_
to provide the other Parties or their respective Representatives with access
to or to disclose information (A) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in accordance with
this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party to such access or disclosure), (B) the disclosure of which would
violate any Law applicable to such Party or any of its Representatives (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty), (C) that is
subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the
maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege, including by means of entry
into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate the loss of such
privilege) or (D) for the purpose of allowing Parties or their

 



57

    

 respective Representatives to collect samples of soil, air, water,
groundwater or building materials. The Parties will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other
Parties and any of their respective subsidiaries that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior to the Merger
Effective Time, the Parties shall not, and shall cause their
respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or otherwise
communicate with parties with which any of the other Parties or any other of
their respective subsidiaries has a business relationship regarding the
business of the other Parties and their respective subsidiaries or this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of such other Party ( _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to
restrict the Parties from contacting such parties in pursuing the business of
the Parties operating in the ordinary course).

 

(b) Each Party will hold, and will cause its respective Representatives
and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to the extent

disseminating public disclosure, or (C) providing access to the properties,
offices, assets, books, records and personnel of REIT I and the REIT I
Subsidiaries and furnishing non-public information pursuant to (but only

continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person relating to, or in furtherance of such inquiries, proposals, offers or

similar obligation to REIT I or any of the REIT I Subsidiaries; and (iv)
disclose to stockholders of REIT I any information required to be disclosed

(iv), to the extent any such disclosure addresses the Merger or an
Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying, or does not expressly restate and publicly reaffirm,
the REIT I Board Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Go

Proposal received less than five (5) Business Days before the date of the Go
Shop Period End Time, not later than five (5) Business Days after the receipt
of such Acquisition Proposal), has resulted in, or would be reasonably likely
to result in, a Superior Proposal (such Person, a " _Go Shop Bidder_ ");
_provided_ , that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Go Shop Bidder if (i)
the negotiations between REIT I and such Go Shop Bidder with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder becoming a Go Shop
Bidder shall have been terminated, (ii) the Acquisition Proposal submitted by
such Go Shop Bidder prior to the Go Shop Period End Time is withdrawn,
terminated or modified in a manner such that, in the REIT I Special
Committees good faith determination, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, such Acquisition Proposal as so modified
no longer constitutes, or would no longer reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Superior Proposal, or (iii) such Go Shop Bidder otherwise ceases to be
actively pursuing

 



58

    

 efforts to acquire REIT I or the REIT I Operating Partnership. No later than
24 hours after the Go Shop Period End Time (or after a bidder is determined to
be a Go Shop Bidder if such determination occurs after the Go Shop Period End
Time), REIT I shall notify REIT II in writing (i) if any Go Shop Bidders
remain at such time, (ii) of the identity of such Go Shop Bidder(s) and (iii)
of the material terms and conditions of the most recent Acquisition Proposal
received from such Go Shop Bidder(s) (and shall include with such notice (x)
copies of any written Acquisition Proposal, including any proposed transaction
agreement and any related transaction documents and financing commitments, if
any and (y) a written summary of the material terms of any related Acquisition
Proposal not made in writing (including any material terms proposed orally or
supplementally)), and thereafter shall promptly (and in any event no later
than 24 hours after the occurrence of such developments, discussions or
negotiations or receipt of materials) (x) keep REIT II reasonably informed of
all material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any such
Acquisition Proposal and (y) provide REIT II with any written supplements or
written additions to any written Acquisition Proposal, including any revisions
to any proposed transaction agreement and any related transaction documents
and financing commitments, if any. Without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the Go Shop Period End Time, REIT I will promptly (and in any event no
later than 24 hours after the receipt thereof) notify REIT II in writing if
(A) any Acquisition Proposal is received by REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary,
(B) any request for information relating to REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary is
received by REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary from any Person who informs REIT I
or any REIT I Subsidiary that it is considering making or has made an
Acquisition Proposal or (C) any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated with REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary regarding any Acquisition
Proposal, in each case from a Person that is not a Go Shop Bidder, and shall,
in any such notice to REIT II, indicate the identity of the Person making, and
the material terms and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry (and shall include with such notice (x) copies of any written
Acquisition Proposal, including any proposed transaction agreement and any
related transaction documents and financing commitments, if any and (y) a
written summary of the material terms of any related Acquisition Proposal not
made in writing (including any material terms proposed orally or
supplementally)), and thereafter shall promptly (and in any event no later
than 24 hours after the occurrence of such developments, discussions or
negotiations or receipt of materials) (x) keep REIT II reasonably informed of
all material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (y) provide REIT II with any
written supplements or written additions to any written Acquisition Proposal,
including any revisions to any proposed transaction agreement and any related
transaction documents and financing commitments, if any. Neither REIT I nor
any REIT I Subsidiary will enter into any agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits REIT I from providing
any information to REIT II in accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_, and except with respect to
a Go Shop Bidder, from and after the Go-Shop Period End Time, REIT I shall
not, and shall cause each of the REIT I Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers and Affiliates, and shall direct each of its
and the REIT I Subsidiaries other Representatives (to the extent acting on
behalf of REIT I) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers for, or
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to any inquiry, proposal, offer or other action that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding or otherwise in furtherance of, or
furnish to any Person other than a REIT II Party or its Representatives, any
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating any inquiry, proposal, offer or other action that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, or to otherwise obtain an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) release any Person from or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or similar obligation
(provided that REIT I shall be permitted to waive or to not enforce any
provision of any confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or similar
obligation to permit a Person to make a confidential Acquisition Proposal
directly to the REIT I Special Committee if the REIT I Special Committee
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
any such failure to waive or to not enforce would be inconsistent with or
otherwise result in a breach of the REIT I directors duties under applicable
Law), (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding,
contract or agreement (whether binding or not) contemplating or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or

 



59

    

 (v) take any action to exempt any Person from any Takeover Statute or
similar restrictive provision of the REIT I Organizational Documents. In
furtherance of the foregoing and except with respect to a Go Shop Bidder and
as otherwise permitted by this _Section 7.3_, REIT I shall, and shall cause
each REIT I Subsidiary and each Representative of REIT I and the REIT I
Subsidiaries to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal and shall immediately terminate all physical
and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person and
exercise and use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any contractual
rights available to REIT I to cause such Person to return and/or destroy all
non-public information concerning REIT I and the REIT I Subsidiaries to the
extent permitted pursuant to any confidentiality agreement with such Person
and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access granted
to such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, after the Go Shop Period End Time
and until the receipt of Stockholder Approval, REIT I, the REIT I
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may continue to take any of
the actions described in _Section 7.3(a)_ with respect to any proposals or
offers regarding any Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Go Shop Bidder on or
before the Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended or modified
proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal submitted by a
Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time if the REIT I
Special Committee has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors that such Acquisition
Proposal (as may be amended or modified) is or is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a
Go Shop Bidder if (i) the negotiations between REIT I and such Go Shop Bidder
with respect to the Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder
becoming a Go Shop Bidder shall have been terminated, (ii) the Acquisition
Proposal submitted by such Go Shop Bidder prior to the Go Shop Period End Time
is withdrawn, terminated or modified in a manner such that, in the REIT I
Special Committees good faith determination, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, such Acquisition Proposal as so
modified no longer constitutes, or would no longer reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, or (iii) such Go Shop Bidder otherwise ceases
to be actively pursuing efforts to acquire REIT I or the REIT I Operating
Partnership.

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to the time, but not after,
Stockholder Approval is obtained, REIT I and its Representatives may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a person or persons
who has made a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach
of this _Section 7.3_ (provided that REIT I (x) receives from the person or
persons so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, and (y) as contemplated above, REIT I discloses to REIT II (and
provides copies to REIT II of) such written Acquisition Proposal and
concurrently furnishes, makes available or provides access to any nonpublic
information provided to such person or persons to the extent not previously so
provided to REIT II), and (B) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any person who has made such a written Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in
clause (A) or (B) above, the REIT I Special Committee has either determined
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or determined
in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal.

 

(d) Except as expressly provided in _Section 7.3(e)_, _Section 7.3(f)_
and  _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, neither the REIT I Board, nor any committee
thereof, nor any group of directors, formally or informally, shall: (i)
change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose or announce
or authorize or resolve to, or announce its intention to change, withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner adverse to REIT II, the
REIT I Board Recommendation, (ii) authorize, approve, endorse, declare
advisable, adopt or recommend or propose to publicly authorize, approve,
endorse, declare advisable, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) authorize, cause or permit REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary to enter into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or (iv) fail to make the REIT I Board
Recommendation or fail to include the REIT I Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (any event described in clause (i), (ii) or this clause (iv),
whether taken by the REIT I Board or a committee thereof, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

 



60

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time after the date of this Agreement and before Stockholder Approval is
obtained and subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section
7.3(e)_ in all material respects, if REIT I receives an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not from a Go Shop Bidder) that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 7.3_ (and such proposal is not withdrawn) and the REIT I
Special Committee determines that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such
Superior Proposal or that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the REIT I directors duties under applicable Law, then the
REIT I Board (based on the recommendation of the REIT I Special Committee) may
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_; _provided_ , that the REIT I Board may
not take action contemplated by this _Section 7.3(e)_ unless:

 

(i) REIT I has notified REIT II in writing that the REIT I Board intends
to take such action at least five (5) Business Days in advance of effecting
an Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the reasons for such action, include a description of the material
terms of the Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of such
agreements (including any amendments, supplements or modifications) between
REIT I and the party making such Superior Proposal to such notice (a " _REIT I
Change Notice_ "); and

 

(ii) during the five (5) Business Day period following REIT IIs receipt
of a REIT I Change Notice, REIT I shall have negotiated with (and directed
its outside financial and outside legal advisors to negotiate with) REIT II in
good faith (to the extent REIT II desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith determination of the
REIT I Special Committee, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
outside financial advisors) a Superior Proposal; _provided,_ that
any amendment, supplement or modification to any Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and REIT I may not enter into any such
Superior Proposal pursuant this _Section 7.3(e)_ or make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ unless REIT I has complied with
the requirements of this _Section 7.3(e)_ with respect to such new
Acquisition Proposal including sending an additional REIT I Change Notice
(except that the new negotiation period under this _Section 7.3(e)(ii)_ shall
be three (3) Business Days instead of five (5) Business Days). Notwithstanding
anything in this  _Section 7.3(e)(ii)_, neither REIT IIs acceptance nor
rejection of REIT Is offer to negotiate pursuant to this _Section
7.3(e)(ii)_ shall have any bearing on REIT IIs right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii) _herein.

(f) Nothing in this _Section 7.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prevent the REIT I Board or REIT I, directly or indirectly, from (i) taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of the REIT I a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, making any required disclosure to the
stockholders of the REIT I under applicable Law, including Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of REIT I if the REIT I Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
(and based on the recommendation of the REIT I Special Committee) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the REIT I
directors under applicable Law; provided, however, that to the extent any such
disclosure addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the REIT I Board with respect to this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change if not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation
of the REIT I Board Recommendation.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
REIT I shall not, and shall not permit any REIT I Subsidiaries or any of its
or their respective Affiliates or Representatives to, reimburse or agree to
reimburse the fees or expenses of any Person (including any Go Shop Bidder or
its Representatives) in connection with (or related to) an Acquisition
Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with any

 



61

    

 acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal entered into
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and resulting in termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 9.1(c)_.

(h) REIT I agrees that in the event any Representative of REIT I or any
REIT I Subsidiary takes any action that, if taken by REIT I would constitute
a material violation of this Section 7.3, then REIT I shall be deemed to be in
violation of this Section 7.3 for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person
(other than REIT II or any REIT II Subsidiaries), whether in one transaction
or a series of related transactions, relating to any (a) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiary that would constitute a
"significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X), (b) sale
or other disposition, by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or any similar transaction, of any assets of REIT I or any REIT I
Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of REIT I and
the REIT I Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (c) issue, sale or other
disposition by REIT I or any REIT I Subsidiaries of (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or any similar
transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or more of the
votes associated with the outstanding shares of REIT I Common Stock, (d)
tender offer or exchange offer in which any Person or " _group_ " (as such
term is defined under the Exchange Act) shall acquire beneficial ownership (as
such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the votes associated with the
outstanding shares of REIT I Common Stock, (e) recapitalization,
restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar type of transaction
with respect to REIT I in which a third party shall acquire beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of REIT I Common Stock, or
(f) transaction that is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions; provided, however, that the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall not include (i) the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction solely
among REIT I and one or more of the REIT I Subsidiaries or solely among the
REIT I Subsidiaries.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal (except for
purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" to "20%" shall be replaced with "50%") which the REIT I Board (based
on the recommendation of the REIT I Special Committee) determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with its outside legal and financial
advisors and after taking into account (a) all of the terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be
amended by REIT II) and (b) the feasibility and certainty of consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal on the terms proposed (taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
and conditions to consummation thereof) to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the stockholders of REIT I (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by REIT II)).

 

Section 7.4 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance
with, _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, the Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
none of the Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public
statement or filing prior to obtaining the other Parties consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned);
_provided_ , that a Party may, without obtaining the other Parties consent,
issue such press release or make such public statement or filing as may be
required by Law or Order if it is not possible to consult with the other Party
before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties have agreed upon
the form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of
this Agreement, and shall make such joint press release no later than one (1)
Business Day following the date on which this Agreement is signed.

commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other

any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) subject to _Section 7.6(c)_, defending any lawsuits or other

divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of such Party, any of
its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries of REIT II after the Closing) or
their Affiliates or (B) otherwise to take or commit to take any actions that
would limit the freedom of such Party, its subsidiaries (including
subsidiaries of REIT II after the Closing) or their Affiliates with respect
to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines
or assets.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing _Section
7.5(a)_, each of the Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective
Affiliates to give) any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties
shall use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents that are

shall cause their respective Affiliates to, furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with the preparation of any required applications, notices,
registrations and requests as may be required or advisable to be filed with
any Governmental Authority and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry

to the REIT II Parties, and the REIT II Parties and their Representatives
shall give prompt notice to the REIT I Parties, of any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) The REIT I Parties and their Representatives shall give prompt notice
to the REIT II Parties, and the REIT II Parties and their Representatives
shall give prompt notice to the REIT I Parties, if (i) any representation or
warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate
such that it would be reasonable to expect that the applicable closing
conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii)
it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by
the REIT I Parties, the REIT II Parties or their respective Representatives to
provide such prompt notice under this _Section 7.6(b)_ shall not constitute a
breach of covenant for purposes of  _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.3(b)_,

(c)  The REIT I Parties and their Representatives shall give prompt notice
to the REIT II Parties, and the REIT II Parties and their Representatives
shall give prompt notice to the REIT I Parties, of any Action commenced or,
to such Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such

Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The REIT I Parties and their respective Representatives shall give
REIT II the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the REIT I Parties and/or
their directors, officers or partners relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without REIT IIs prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The REIT II Parties and their
respective Representatives shall give the REIT I Parties the opportunity to
reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any litigation against
the REIT II Parties and/or their directors, officers or partners relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without REIT Is prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of  _Section
7.7(b)_ and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, during the period
commencing as of the Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, REIT II shall (and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any Action to the extent such Action
arises out of or pertains to (x) any action or

 



64

    

 omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity
as a manager, director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent
of REIT I or any of the REIT I Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; and
(ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Action the expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and any expenses incurred by any
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
indemnification) of any Indemnified Party without the requirement of any bond
or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but
subject to REIT IIs or the Surviving Entitys receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, REIT II or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, (i) shall not
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit or proceeding against or
investigation of any Indemnified Party for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 7.7(a)_ without the Indemnified Partys prior written
consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (ii)
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) and (iii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
promptly refund to REIT II or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

(b)  Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each of REIT II and the Surviving Entity agrees that, during
the period commencing as of the Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, all rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
managers, directors, officers, partners, members, trustees, employees, agents,
fiduciaries or other individuals of REIT I or any of the REIT I Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in (i) the REIT I Charter, the
REIT I Bylaws or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any REIT I Subsidiary (the " _REIT I Organizational Documents_
") and (ii) indemnification agreements of REIT I shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of six (6) years following the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of REIT II and the Surviving Entity and
the organizational documents of any applicable REIT II Subsidiary or REIT I
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability of directors and officers than
are set forth in the REIT II Governing Documents as of the Merger Effective
Time or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any
REIT II Subsidiary. The REIT II Governing Documents provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years
following the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective

Ratio and (ii) in the case of REIT II, to holders of REIT II Common Stock and
REIT II OP Units, in an amount per share of REIT II Common Stock or per REIT

72

    

 Change Notice delivered within five (5) Business Days of the Go Shop Period

Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as

intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise.

enter into this Agreement. In the event that REIT I shall fail to pay the
applicable Termination Payment when due, REIT I shall reimburse REIT II for
all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by REIT II
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this _Section 9.3_. Further, if REIT I

order to obtain the payment, REIT II commences a suit which results in a
judgment against REIT I for the payment set forth in this  _Section 9.3(b)_,
REIT I shall pay to REIT II its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the
prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment.

 

(f) REIT I shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
applicable Termination Payment with an escrow agent reasonably selected by
REIT II, after reasonable consultation with REIT I, and pursuant to a written
escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") reflecting the terms set forth
in this _Section 9.3_ and otherwise reasonably acceptable to each of the
Parties and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the
applicable Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall be
made by REIT I promptly after receipt of notice from REIT II that the Escrow
Agreement has been executed by the parties thereto. The Escrow Agreement shall
provide that the applicable Termination Payment in escrow or the applicable
portion thereof shall be released to REIT II on an annual basis based upon
the delivery by REIT II to the escrow agent of any one (or a combination) of
the following:

(i) a letter from REIT IIs certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to REIT II without causing
REIT II to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code for the applicable taxable year of REIT II determined as if the payment
of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)
(H) or 856(c)(3)(A) (I) of the Code (such income, " _Qualifying REIT Income_
"), in which case the escrow agent shall release to REIT II such maximum
amount stated in the accountants letter;

(ii) a letter from REIT IIs counsel indicating that REIT II received a
private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by REIT II of the
applicable Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income
or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to
REIT II the remainder of the applicable Termination Payment; or

 



73

    

(iii) a letter from REIT IIs counsel indicating that REIT II has
received a tax opinion from REIT IIs outside counsel or accountant,
respectively, to the effect that the receipt by REIT II of the applicable
Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or should
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to REIT II the
remainder of the applicable Termination Payment.

 

The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this _Section 9.3(f)_
at the reasonable request of REIT II in order to (A) maximize the portion of
the applicable Termination Payment that may be distributed to REIT II
hereunder without causing REIT II to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (B) improve REIT IIs chances of securing the
favorable private letter ruling from the IRS described in this _Section
9.3(f)_ or (C) assist REIT II in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from its
outside counsel or accountant described in this _Section 9.3(f)_. The Escrow
Agreement shall provide that REIT II shall bear all costs and expenses under
the Escrow Agreement and that any portion of the applicable Termination
Payment held in escrow for ten (10) years shall be released by the escrow
agent to REIT I. REIT I shall not be a party to the Escrow Agreement and
shall not bear any liability, cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly
from the Escrow Agreement (other than any Taxes imposed on REIT I in
connection therewith). REIT II shall fully indemnify REIT I and hold REIT I
harmless from and against any such liability, cost or expense.

Section 9.4   _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties by action taken or
authorized by the REIT I Special Committee and the REIT II Special Committee,
respectively, at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval
and prior to the Merger Effective Time; provided, that after the Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (i) any amendment of this
Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be
delivered under this Agreement to the holders of REIT I Common Stock, or which
by applicable Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of REIT I
without such further approval of such stockholders, or (ii) any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

Section 10.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
present or future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision
shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. (a) This
Agreement (including the Exhibits, Schedules, the REIT I Disclosure Letter and
the REIT II Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreements (a)
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and, (b) except for the provisions of
_Article 3_ (which, from and after the Merger Effective Time, shall be
for the benefit of holders of shares of REIT I Common Stock immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time), _Section 7.7_ (which, from and after the
Merger Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties)
and  _Section 10.5(b)_, are not intended to confer upon any Person other
than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, REIT I and REIT I
Operating Partnership, on behalf of themselves and the REIT I Subsidiaries,
hereby (i) acknowledge that none of the lenders or other parties
providing any financing to REIT II and the REIT II Parties (including for the
purposes hereof the REIT I Parties and the REIT I Subsidiaries as of the
Merger Effective Time) (collectively the " _Financing Sources_ ") (and/or any
of their Affiliates and/or their or their Affiliates officers, directors,
employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents, attorneys or
representatives) shall have any liability to any REIT I Party or any REIT I
Subsidiary under this Agreement or for any claim made by any REIT I Party or
any REIT I Subsidiary based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any dispute
relating to, or arising from, any debt financing, any commitment letters
relating thereto or the performance thereof (collectively a " _Debt Financing_
"), (ii) waive any rights or claims of any kind or nature (whether in law or
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) any of the REIT I Parties or
any REIT I Subsidiary may have against any Financing Source (and/or any of
their Affiliates and/or their or their Affiliates officers, directors,
employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents, attorneys or
representatives) relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any
commitment letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (iii)
agree not to commence (and/if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise
terminate, and not to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding
against any Financing Source (and/or any of their Affiliates and/or their or
their Affiliates officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
advisors, agents, attorneys or representatives) in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, any debt commitment letters or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing in this _Section 10.5(b)_ will limit
the rights of REIT II in respect of the Debt Financing under any commitment
letter related thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, no Financing Source
(and/or any of their Affiliates and/or their or their Affiliates
officers, directors, employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents,
attorneys or representatives) shall be subject to any special, consequential,
punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature to a REIT I Party
or any REIT I Subsidiary. Any disputes involving the Financing Source will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable Laws of the State
of New York without giving regard to conflicts or choice of law principles
that would result in the application of any Law other than the Law of the
State of New York, and shall be subject to the wavier of jury trial,
jurisdiction and venue (and related waivers) set forth in any commitment
letter provided by the Financing Sources. The terms of this  _Section
10.5(b)_ may not be amended without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

 

Section 10.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Merger
Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



76

    

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Venue_.

 

(a) Other than as set forth in _Section 10.5(b)_, this Agreement and all
claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may
be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without
giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles (whether the State of
Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).

 

(b) All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined exclusively in any Maryland state or federal court. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any such Maryland state or federal court, for the
purpose of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought
by any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence any such dispute except in such
courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such dispute may be
heard and determined in any such Maryland state or federal court, (iv)

objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute, (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such dispute, and (vi) agrees,
with respect to any action filed in a Maryland state court, to jointly request
an assignment to the Maryland Business and Technology Case Management Program.
Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such dispute shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 10.2_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process
in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties. This Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.9 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and each
Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity.

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.10_.

 

Section 10.11 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and
their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

 



77
