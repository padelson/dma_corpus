B. Buyer wishes to purchase from the Shareholders, and the Shareholders wish
to sell to Buyer, all of the Companys issued and outstanding capital stock
and options and warrants to acquire capital stock, upon the terms and

value per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), options to purchase
4,794,733 common shares, no par value per share of the Company (the
"Options"), and warrants to purchase 2,015,745 common shares, no par value per
share, of the Company (the "Warrants," and together with the Shares and the
Options, the "Securities"), which Securities constitute all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock and rights to acquire capital stock of the Company.
The certificates for the Shares and the documents representing the Options and
the Warrants shall, when so delivered by the Shareholders, be duly endorsed
for transfer to Buyer, or have executed stock powers endorsed to Buyer
attached to the Securities, and the Company shall have paid or provided for
all requisite documentary and/or stock transfer stamps. The Shareholders
shall cause the Company to prepare, execute and deliver at Closing

free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances, mortgages, pledges,
restrictions and security interests, and shall also be accompanied by all of
the stock books, stock ledgers, minute books and corporate seals of the
Company.



 

1 1.2 _Consideration for Purchase._



1.2.1 _Purchase Price._



The aggregate consideration for the Securities shall consist of the following,

as  _Exhibit 1.2.1(a)_ (the "Note"), subject to adjustment pursuant to
Sections 1.2.3(b), 1.4 and 1.5, (as adjusted, the "Cash Amount"), plus



(b) _Escrow Deposit._ The deposit by Buyer of $5,000,000 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (the "Escrow Fund") at the Closing into an escrow
account with one of the banks in Buyers lending syndicate acceptable to the
Majority Shareholders (the "Escrow Agent") to be distributed by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement");
the Escrow Fund, along with any interest or income earned thereon, shall be
used to satisfy any indemnification claims made by Buyer pursuant to Sections
5 or 7, plus 



(c) _Performance Payment._ The payment by Buyer to the Shareholders of an
aggregate of $2,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds on
January 2, 2008 so long as the employment of none of Nima Taghavi, Michael

entered into pursuant to Section 3.1.11), or (2) by Nima Taghavi, Michael Maas
or Robert Dyer without Good Reason (as that term is defined in their
respective Employment Agreements) on or before December 31, 2007. If only one
of Nima Taghavi, Michael Maas or Robert Dyer is not employed by the Company on
December 31, 2007 due to the terminated employees termination by the Company
for Cause or by such terminated employee without Good Reason, then the payment
by Buyer to the Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.2.1(c) shall be
$1,500,000 ($1,000,000 if Robert Dyer is the terminated employee). If only two
of Nima Taghavi, Michael Maas or Robert Dyer are not employed by the Company
on December 31, 2007 due to each such terminated employees termination by the
Company for Cause or by each such terminated employee without Good Reason or
by a combination of such terminations, then the payment by Buyer to the
Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.2.1(c) shall be $1,000,000 ($500,000
if Robert Dyer is one of the terminated employees). If none of Nima Taghavi,
Michael Maas or Robert Dyer is employed by the Company on December 31, 2007

by each such terminated employee without Good Reason or by a combination of
such terminations, then there shall be no payment by Buyer to the
Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.2.1(c).

Earn Out Payment for 2005), and (2) the actual EBITDA for 2006 is more than
$20,000,000, Buyer shall make an additional Earn Out Payment (the "2005 Earn

(ii) _2006 Makeup in 2007._ If (1) the actual EBITDA for 2006 is at least
$17,000,000 but is less than $20,000,000 (resulting in a less than $10,000,000

(3) the actual EBITDA for 2007 is more than $22,000,000 plus the amount of
EBITDA necessary to make the maximum 2006 Earn Out Make Up, Buyer shall make
an additional Earn Out Payment (the "2005 Earn Out Make Up In 2007") equal to
$1 for each $1 that actual EBITDA for 2007 is more than $22,000,000 plus the
amount of EBITDA necessary to make the maximum 2006 Earn Out Make
Up; provided, however, that the maximum additional Earn Out Payment shall
equal $3,000,000 minus the 2005 Earn Out paid pursuant to Section 1.2.2(b)
minus the 2005 Earn Out Make Up paid pursuant to Section 1.2.2(e)(i).



(f) _Disputes; Payment._



(i) _Buyer Determinations._ Buyer will deliver to the Representative its
written calculation, in reasonable detail, of the 2005 Earn Out, the 2006 Earn
Out, the 2005 Earn Out Make Up (if applicable), the 2007 Earn Out, the 2006
Earn Out Make Up (if applicable) and the 2005 Earn Out Make Up In 2007

6 (ii) _Representative Review._ The Representative shall have 30 days after
receipt of the Calculation (the "Objection Period") to review it, during
which time the Representative may elect to prepare his own calculation of the
applicable Earn Out Payment (the "Representatives Calculation"). If
the Representative either fails to deliver a Representatives Calculation
within the Objection Period or notifies the Buyer in writing that he has no
objection to the Calculation before the expiration of the Objection Period,
the matters set forth in the Calculation shall be conclusive and binding on
the parties and the applicable Earn Out Payment shall be paid by Buyer to the
Shareholders as provided in Section 1.2.2(f)(vi). If the Representative
prepares a Representatives Calculation and delivers it in writing to the
Buyer within the Objection Period, then the parties shall resolve any
discrepancy pursuant to this Section 1.2.2(f). To the extent that the
Calculation and the Representatives Calculation agree, such amount shall be
paid by the Buyer to the Shareholders as provided in Section 1.2.2(f)(vi).



(iii) _Disputes Over Calculation._ If there is a discrepancy between the
Calculation and the Representatives Calculation, the parties shall meet
within 15 days after delivery of the Representatives Calculation to Buyer

faith. If the parties are unable to resolve their disputes within the Meet
and Confer Period, they shall agree upon a mediator and shall meet with the
mediator within 15 days after the end of the Meet and Confer Period and
attempt to resolve their disputes in good faith. Buyer and the Shareholders
shall each be responsible for half of the mediators fees and costs, subject
to Section 1.2.2(f)(iv).



(iv) _Arbitration._ If the parties are unable to resolve their disputes
regarding the Earn Out Payment for the applicable period pursuant to the
previous paragraphs, either Buyer or the Representative may submit the dispute
to binding arbitration by notice to the other party beginning 30 days after
the first attempt to resolve the disputes with a mediator. Such
arbitration shall be resolved before a single arbitrator, who is an expert in
the subject matter of the dispute and a Certified Public Accountant ("CPA"),
appointed by the American Arbitration Association or its successor in Orange
County, California. The determination of the arbitrator shall be final,
absolute and binding upon the parties. The arbitration and the arbitrator
shall be governed by the duly promulgated rules and regulations of the
American Arbitration Association or its successor then in effect. The
Shareholders and Buyer agree that a judgment of any court of applicable
jurisdiction may be rendered upon any arbitration award made pursuant to this
Section.



(v) _Expenses._ Each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys,
accountants, experts and any other fees and costs relating to such dispute
process and one half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of the
American Arbitration Association; provided, however, that, unless otherwise  



 

7  agreed by the parties, if at any point in the dispute resolution process it
is finally determined (by the arbitrator or other judicial officer with
authority to render a final determination) or agreed (by the parties if a
settlement is reached) that the dollar amount in dispute that is resolved in
favor of the Shareholders divided by the total dollar amount in dispute (based
on the Representatives Calculation and expressed as a percentage) is (1) 10%
or less, the Shareholders shall promptly reimburse the Buyer for all of the
Buyers fees and costs associated with the dispute (including, but not limited
to, the reasonable fees and costs of attorneys, accountants, and experts and
any other fees and costs relating to such dispute incurred by Buyer, the fees
and expenses of the arbitrator and of the American Arbitration Association
incurred by Buyer and the fees and costs of the mediator pursuant to Section
1.2.2(f)(iii) incurred by Buyer, and (2) 60% or more, the Buyer shall promptly
reimburse the Shareholders for all of the Shareholders fees and costs
associated with the dispute (including, but not limited to, the reasonable
fees and costs of attorneys, accountants, and experts and any other fees and
costs relating to such dispute incurred by the Shareholders, the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator and of the American Arbitration Association
incurred by the Shareholders and the fees and costs of the mediator pursuant
to Section 1.2.2(f)(iii) incurred by the Shareholders.



(vi) _Payment._ Within five business days after the amount of the applicable
Earn Out Payment (or, if applicable, the discrepancy between the Calculation
and the Representatives Calculation) is conclusively determined (i.e., when
the Calculation becomes conclusive, or when the parties agree on all or part
of the applicable Earn Out Payment, or when the parties resolve their dispute
by agreement, or when the arbitrators decision is final), Buyer shall pay the
Shareholders, by wire transfer, any required unpaid Earn Out Payment, plus or
minus the net costs of the dispute awarded pursuant to Section 1.2.2(f)(iv);
provided, however, that the Buyer shall not be required to deliver the 2005
Earn Out earlier than six (6) months after the date of this Agreement.



(g) _Buyer s Earn Out Obligations._ After the Closing through December 31,
2007, Buyer shall cause the Company to remain a separate entity and shall
engage in the Business exclusively through the Company, except (1) in the
United Kingdom, and (2) for merchandising services.



1.2.3 _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Allocation of Purchase Price._ 



(a) _Section 338(h)(10) Election._ Buyer, the Company, the Shareholders and
the Shareholders spouses, as applicable, will jointly make or cause to be
made the election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code") (and any corresponding election under state,
local, and foreign Tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Securities under this Agreement (a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Buyer, the
Company, the Shareholders and the Shareholders spouses, as applicable, will
(1) cooperate in the preparation and filing of any Section 338(h)(10) Election
with respect to the sale of the Securities, (2) take all such action as is
required in order to give full effect to the Section 338(h)(10) Election for
federal, state,  



 

8  local and foreign Tax purposes to the greatest extent permitted by law, and
(3) file their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
338(h)(10) Election and the Purchase Price Allocation. To the extent required
by applicable law, the Shareholders will include any income, gain, loss,
deduction, or any other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election on their Tax Returns. Shareholders shall indemnify Buyer, Company
and its subsidiaries against any adverse consequences arising out of any
failure to pay any such Taxes, except as otherwise provided in Section
1.2.3(b). The Shareholders shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer at Closing
a validly executed IRS Form 8023 (and, as applicable, analogous forms required
pursuant to state, local or foreign Tax law) providing for a Section
338(h)(10) Election with respect to the purchase and sale of the Securities,
with such portions of the forms as relate to the Shareholders and the Company
properly completed. Buyer shall be responsible for the filing of, and shall
timely file, such forms. After filing such Form 8023 or analogous state, local
or foreign tax form (including the Purchase Price Allocation discussed
below), Buyer shall provide a fully completed and executed copy to the
Shareholders.



(b) _Adjustment to Purchase Price for Section 338(h)(10) Election_. The
Purchase Price shall be increased by, and Buyer shall reimburse the
Shareholders to the extent of their actually owned Shares (as opposed to
options or Warrants) that they have held for more than a year as of the
Closing Date for, an amount equal to (1) 23.52941176%, multiplied by (2)
the amount of such Shareholders gain pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10)
Election characterized as ordinary income or otherwise taxed at ordinary
income tax rates (as opposed to long-term capital gain rates) to such
Shareholder as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and based on the
Purchase Price Allocation that would have been taxed at long-term capital gain
rates had the transactions described in this Agreement occurred without the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. In addition, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by, and Buyer shall reimburse the Shareholders to the extent of
their actually owned Shares (as opposed to options or warrants), for an amount
equal to (1) interest and incremental taxes (to the extent the applicable
Shareholder certifies that it actually incurred incremental taxes with no
offsetting benefit) with respect to the difference in timing of tax payments
(including interest on delinquent income taxes imposed by the
Internal Revenue Service, but less any interest on overpaid income taxes paid
by the Internal Revenue Service) and any penalties and expenses incurred,
divided by (2) 0.78305, all to the extent resulting from a difference in the
allocation of the Shareholders basis in Shares owned by such Shareholder
among the Purchase Price payments (using the installment method), pursuant to
Section 453B(h) of the Code, resulting from the 338(h)(10) Election. The
Shareholders agree to treat the payments pursuant to the Note under the
installment method under Section 453 of the Code. The determination of the
amounts of such reimbursements and the resolution of any disputes concerning
the amounts shall be made in the same manner as described in Section 1.5.2
with respect to the determination of Working Capital, Net Assets and the
Dividend. Buyer shall also pay any Tax imposed on the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or both attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, in excess of such amount that would have been payable if no such
election had been made, including, without limitation, the State of California
franchise tax of the Company equal to 1.5% of the Companys gain on the
deemed sale of its assets.



 

9 (c) _Allocation of Purchase Price._ Buyer and the Shareholders agree to
allocate the Purchase Price, the liabilities of the Company and its qualified
subchapter S subsidiaries, and all other relevant items (including, for
example and without limitation, any adjustments or additions to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Sections 1.2.2, 1.2.3(b), 1.4 and 1.5 of this Agreement)
(the "Purchase Price Allocation"), in accordance with the allocations provided
by Buyer to the Representative before the respective parties Tax Returns
affected by the Purchase Price Allocation are due. In the event that, after
the Purchase Price Allocation is determined, the Purchase Price is adjusted
(including adjustments pursuant to Sections 1.2.2, 1.2.3(b), 1.4 and 1.5 of
this Agreement), the Purchase Price Allocation shall also be adjusted. To the
extent permitted by the Code, the Treasury regulations under the Code or other
applicable Tax law, any adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be allocated,
to the extent possible, to the classes of assets that were the subject of the
adjustments to the Purchase Price, and to the extent that such adjustments do
not relate to any specific asset classification, shall be allocated to
goodwill. Buyer, the Company and the Shareholders shall file all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refunds) in a manner consistent with
the Purchase Price Allocation, including any adjustments to such Purchase
Price Allocation made pursuant to this paragraph, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to sustain such allocation in any subsequent Tax
audit or dispute.



(d) _Allocation Among the Shareholders_. The Purchase Price (except for the
portion of the Purchase Price provided for in Section 1.2.3(b)) shall be
allocated among the Securities and the Shareholders as provided in this
Section. The "Per Share Consideration" shall equal (1) the Purchase Price
(except for the portion of the Purchase Price provided for in Section
1.2.3(b)) plus the exercise price of the Options and the Warrants, divided by
(2) the number of all outstanding Shares and the number of the Companys
common shares underlying the Options and the Warrants. Each holder of Shares
shall be allocated an amount of the Purchase Price (except for the portion of
the Purchase Price provided for in Section 1.2.3(b)) equal to the Per Share
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares held, and each holder
of Options, Warrants or both shall be allocated an amount of the Purchase
Price (except for the portion of the Purchase Price provided for in Section
1.2.3(b)) equal to the Per Share Consideration multiplied by the number of the
Companys common shares underlying the Options and Warrants held minus the
exercise price of such Options and Warrants. The portion of the Purchase Price
provided for in Section 1.2.3(b) shall be allocated to the Shareholders in
proportion to their share of the Companys related income.



1.3 _Dividend._  



Before the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall cause the Company to declare
a dividend payable to the Shareholders in an aggregate amount equal to the
federal and state income taxes due from the Shareholders on the Companys
earnings through the Closing Date calculated at the maximum tax rates
for state and federal purposes that are taxable to the Shareholders
consistent with past practices (i.e., one rate for all of the Shareholders),
less any previous distributions to the Shareholders with respect to such taxes
on such earnings (the "Dividend"), payable as described in Section 1.5.



 

10 1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments Based on Working Capital and Net Assets._



The Cash Amount shall be decreased by the amount that the Companys "Working
Capital" (as defined in Section 1.4.1) as of October 31, 2005 is less than
$14,037,000 and by the amount that the Companys "Net Assets" (as defined in
Section 1.4.2) as of October 31, 2005 is less than $15,473,000. The attached
_Exhibit 1.4_ sets forth adjustments used to calculate the above "Working
Capital" and "Net Assets" targets.



1.4.1 _"Working Capital."_



The Companys "Working Capital" shall be equal to the book value of the
Companys current assets minus the book value of the Companys current
liabilities as of October 31, 2005 (but including, without limitation, any Tax
liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries resulting from the Closing,
the Dividend, and all other liabilities of the Company which result from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) determined in accordance with
GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the Companys accounting policies,
except that the accrued liabilities relating to Coresoft, Inc. and Toys "R"
Us described in the notes to _Exhibit 1.4_ shall equal the amount actually
accrued by the Company in its October 31, 2005 balance sheet (but not less
than the amount as reflected in _Exhibit 1.4_) in the determination of
"Working Capital".



1.4.2  _"Net Assets."_



The Companys "Net Assets" shall be equal to the book value of the Companys
assets minus the book value of the Companys liabilities as of October 31,
2005 (but including, without limitation, any Tax liabilities of the Company
and its subsidiaries resulting from the Closing, the Dividend, and all other
liabilities of the Company which result from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) determined in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner
consistent with Companys accounting policies; provided that, to avoid a
double adjustment for the same Working Capital item, Net Assets shall be
increased by the amount of any excess of $14,037,000 over Working Capital and
provided further that the accrued liabilities relating to Coresoft, Inc. and
Toys "R" Us described in the notes to _Exhibit 1.4_ shall equal the amount
actually accrued by the Company in its October 31, 2005 balance sheet (but not
less than the amount as reflected in  _Exhibit 1.4_) in the determination of
"Net Assets".



1.5 _Initial Estimate and Subsequent Determination of Working Capital, Net
Assets and Dividend._



1.5.1 _Initial Estimate of Working Capital, Net Assets and Dividend._



At least five business days before the Closing Date, the Shareholders shall
deliver to Buyer an initial estimate (accompanied by a written statement
signed by the chief financial officer of the Company that, to the best of his
knowledge and belief, such initial estimate is correct) of the Working Capital
and Net Assets of the Company as of October 31, 2005 and the Dividend as of
the Closing Date (the "Initial Estimate"), which estimates shall be made after
sharing the underlying information with Buyer and consulting with Buyer
concerning such Initial Estimate. The Initial Estimate shall be considered
correct for purposes of determining the estimated Cash Amount (which will be
the amount of the Note delivered at the Closing) and the  



 

11  estimated amount of the Dividend, subject to adjustments after the Closing
Date as provided in Section 1.5.2. The Shareholders shall cause the
Company to pay such estimated Dividend to the Shareholders on or before the
Closing (the "Estimated Dividend").



1.5.2 _Subsequent Determination of Working Capital, Net Assets and Dividend._



As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no event later than
60 days thereafter), Buyers independent certified public accountants (i.e.,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC")) shall conduct an audit of the books and
records of the Company as of October 31, 2005 (the Closing Date with respect
to the Dividend) and shall determine the Working Capital and Net Assets of
the Company as of October 31, 2005, the Dividend amount as of the Closing
Date, the actual Cash Amount and any required adjustments to the estimated
Cash Amount and the estimated Dividend in accordance with this Agreement. PWC
shall present to Buyer and the Representative a report showing their
determination of Working Capital and Net Assets of the Company, the Dividend
amount, the Cash Amount and any required adjustments to the estimated Cash
Amount as of October 31, 2005 and the estimated Dividend as of the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Amounts") and in each case determined in accordance
with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the preceding years (i.e.,
prior to the Closing) reporting practices of the Company and Sections 1.4.1
and 1.4.2.



In the event of a dispute between the parties to this Agreement as to any of
the Amounts, the Buyer (or the Company with respect to the Dividend) shall pay
the Shareholders or the Shareholders shall pay the Buyer (or the Company with
respect to the Dividend), as applicable, by wire transfer, the undisputed
portion of any required adjustment to the estimated Cash Amount or the
estimated Dividend. If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute within
20 business days after receipt of PWCs report, the Representative, at the
Shareholders sole cost and expense, may engage another national firm of
independent certified public accountants to determine the Amounts. Such
accountants shall present to Buyer and the Representative, as representative
of the Shareholders, a report showing their determination of the Amounts. If
the Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, fails to engage such
accountants within such 20 business day period or if the Working Capital or
Net Assets of the Company or the Dividend as determined by such accountants is
not at least $50,000 more than the Working Capital or Net Assets of the
Company or the Dividend as determined by PWC, PWCs determination of the
Amounts shall be conclusive and binding on the parties to this Agreement.



If the Working Capital or Net Assets of the Company or the Dividend as
determined by such accountants is at least $50,000 more than the Working
Capital or Net Assets of the Company or the Dividend as determined by PWC and
the parties are unable to resolve their dispute within 20 business days after
such accountants present their report to the parties, the parties shall submit
the disputed Amounts for determination by an arbitrator in Orange County,
California who shall be CPA, excluding any CPA engaged by Buyer, the Company
or the Shareholders, as mutually agreed upon by the Representative, on behalf
of the Shareholders, and Buyer. If the Representative, on behalf of the
Shareholders, and Buyer are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the Companys
and Buyers independent public accountants shall select an arbitrator who
satisfies the requirements of this Section.



 

12 Each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys, accountants, experts
and any other fees and costs relating to such dispute process and one half of
the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of the American Arbitration
Association; provided, however, that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
if at any point in the dispute resolution process it is finally determined
(by the arbitrator or other judicial officer with authority to render a final
determination) or agreed (by the parties if a settlement is reached) that the
dollar amount in dispute that is resolved in favor of the Shareholders
divided by the total dollar amount in dispute (based on the Amounts calculated
by the national firm of independent certified public accountants engaged by
the Representative to determine the Amounts and expressed as a percentage) is
(1) 10% or less, the Shareholders shall promptly reimburse the Buyer for all
of the Buyers fees and costs associated with the dispute (including, but not
limited to, the reasonable fees and costs of attorneys, accountants, and
experts and any other fees and costs relating to such dispute incurred by
Buyer, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of the American Arbitration
Association incurred by Buyer and the fees and costs of PWC incurred by Buyer,
and (2) 60% or more, the Buyer shall promptly reimburse the Shareholders for
all of the Shareholders fees and costs associated with the dispute
(including, but not limited to, the reasonable fees and costs of attorneys,
accountants, and experts and any other fees and costs relating to such
dispute incurred by the Shareholders, the fees and expenses of the arbitrator
and of the American Arbitration Association incurred by the Shareholders and
the fees and costs of the national firm of independent certified public
accountants engaged by the Representative to determine the Amounts and
incurred by the Shareholders.



The Shareholders and Buyer agree that a judgment of any court of applicable
jurisdiction may be rendered upon any arbitration award made pursuant to
this Section. Within five business days after the earliest of the time PWCs
report becomes conclusive, the time the parties resolve their dispute by
agreement, or the time of the arbitrators decision, the Buyer (or the Company
with respect to the Dividend) shall pay the Shareholders, or the Shareholders
shall pay the Buyer (or the Company with respect to the Dividend), as
applicable, by wire transfer, any required unpaid adjustment to the estimated
Cash Amount or the estimated Dividend. 



1.6 _The Closing._



The Closing under this Agreement shall be held at 10:00 a.m. at the
offices of Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP, 2290 First National
Building, 660 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226-3506 on or before
November 30, 2005, or such other day and time as Buyer and the Shareholders
shall mutually agree upon. The parties agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the closing to occur on October 31, 2005 The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at such place
and time are sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing", and
such closing date is sometimes referred to as the "Closing Date." At the
Closing, the Shareholders shall deliver the Securities and the Company shall
deliver the new certificates pursuant to Section 1.1, Buyer shall pay or
deliver the Purchase Price deliverable at Closing pursuant to Section 1.2, and

5.4 _Defense of Claims._



If any party ("Indemnified Party") receives notice of, or discovers, any claim
or the commencement of any action for which the other party or parties
("Indemnitor") is or may be liable under this Section 5 ("Indemnified
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnitor of such
claim or action in writing and shall provide the Indemnitor with copies of any
pleadings or other documents evidencing such Indemnified Claim; provided that
the failure to provide such notice or copies shall not relieve the Indemnitor
of its obligations, except to the extent that it is prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Indemnified Claim, and, if it so elects, to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. After written notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party of
such election to assume the defense, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of the Indemnified Claim,
other than costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred at the
request of the Indemnitor and other than costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party incurred if the Indemnified Party in good faith believes that there is a
conflict of interests between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor. The
assumption of the defense of any such Indemnified Claim shall not be deemed an
admission by the Indemnitor that it is liable for any such Indemnified Claim.
The Indemnitor may, at its election, settle or compromise any Indemnified
Claim if either (1) the Indemnified Party consents to such settlement or
compromise, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, or (2) such
settlement or compromise includes a complete release of the Indemnified
Party and imposes no continuing obligations on the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Indemnified Claim without
the prior consent of the Indemnitor, unless the Indemnitor shall have failed
or refused to assist the Indemnified Party in the defense of such Indemnified
Claim or shall unreasonably withhold its consent to a proposed settlement or
compromise of such claim. The parties shall use their best efforts to agree on
whether Buyers Damages or Shareholders Damages exist, and if so, the
amount. Any amounts determined to be owed shall be paid within 30 days of such
determination. The parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in
the defense of claims under this Agreement. 



5.5 _Limitation of Liability._



Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5 to the contrary,

 



 

44 (a) _Dollar Limit For Fraudulent Misrepresentation or After Failure to
Remain Employed._ No party shall be liable to indemnify any other party in an
aggregate amount with respect to all such Indemnification Claims in excess of
$55,000,000, except that no limit shall apply to Indemnification Claims (1)
resulting from, a partys fraudulent misrepresentation or intentional breach
of a covenant ("Fraud Claims"), (2) resulting from a partys breach of a
confidentiality, non-compete or non-solicitation covenant, including, without
limitation, Section 6.1 ("Non-Compete Claims"), (3) resulting from breach of
the earn-out, Dividend or purchase price adjustment provisions of Sections
1.2.1(c), 1.2.1(d), 1.2.2, 1.2.3(b), 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 or of the provisions
of Section 3.1.13 ("Price Adjustment Claims"), or (4) resulting from any
claims relating to Taxes.



(b) _Time Limit on Claims._ No party shall be liable to indemnify another
party with respect to any Indemnification Claim unless the party against whom
the Indemnification Claim is asserted has received notice of such
Indemnification Claim twenty-four (24) months or less after the Closing Date,
except that there shall be no time limit, other than the applicable statute
of limitations, on any Indemnification Claims resulting from Fraud Claims,
Non-Compete Claims, Price Adjustment Claims or claims relating to Taxes.



(c) _Basket._ No party shall be liable to indemnify the other party for the
first $150,000 in the aggregate of such partys Indemnified Claims; provided
that this limitation shall not apply to any Price Adjustment Claims or any
claims for breach of Section 2.1.10 or Section 2.1.5.



5.6 _Shareholder Waivers._



The Shareholders waive any right to require the Buyer to (1) proceed against
any particular Shareholder or group of Shareholders (including,
without limitation, the Major Shareholders) or any other person, (2) proceed
against or exhaust any security held from the Shareholders or any other
person, (3) pursue any other remedy in the Buyers power whatsoever. The
Shareholders waive any defense arising by reason of any disability or any
surety or guarantor defense of any Shareholder, or the cessation from any
cause whatsoever of the liability of any other Shareholder, or any claim that
any Shareholders obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of
another Shareholder. The Shareholders waive all diligence, presentments,
demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor, filing of claims in the event of receivership
or bankruptcy of another Shareholder, and notices of acceptance of this
Agreement and of the existence, creation, modification or incurring of new or
additional obligations subject to indemnification under this Agreement.



 

45 6 _OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS._



6.1 _Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete._



6.1.1 _Non-Solicitation._



For a period ending 36 months after the Closing Date, none of the Major
Shareholders nor any of Robert Dyer, Mark Burke or James Kavanagh shall,
either directly or indirectly, (1) solicit to hire any person who is then
employed by, is a consultant to, or is an independent contractor of, Buyer or
the Company or who was employed by Buyer or the Company at any time during the
prior six months, or (2) encourage, induce or attempt to induce, or aid,
assist or abet any other party or person in encouraging, inducing or
attempting to induce, any employee, consultant, independent contractor or
agent covered by clause (1) to alter or terminate his or her employment,
consultation, independent contractor service or agency with Buyer or the
Company.



6.1.2 _Non-Compete._



(a) For a period ending 36 months after the Closing Date, none of the Major
Shareholders shall, either directly or indirectly, (1) engage in the
Business, other than on behalf of the Company, or (2) undertake any efforts or
activities toward pre-incorporating, incorporating, financing, commencing or
continuing any business that, if conducted by any of the Shareholders, would
be a violation of clause (1), including, without limitation, engaging in the
Business through any of the entities listed in _Exhibit 2.1.27_ (a "Competing
Business"), or (3) advise, serve or consult with any person or entity which
is, or, to the Major Shareholders knowledge, will be undertaking efforts
towards, incorporating, financing, commencing or continuing any Competing
Business or activity which engages in a Competing Business. 



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be deemed a
violation of the terms of this Section 6.1.2: (1) the existing Consulting
Engagement Agreements that each of Nima Taghavi and Hossein Taghavi have
entered into with Nirvana International Ltd. (copies of which have been
provided to Buyer or its counsel), but not any amendments or modifications of
such agreements (except that such agreements may be renewed by the parties
thereto without other modifications), and (2) the performance by Nima Taghavi
and Hossein Taghavi of their respective obligations under such Consulting

the Company is prohibited by the hardware supplier from purchasing for resale
into that country the factory refurbished hardware of every hardware supplier

46  sells in that country. For example, if the Company was presented an
opportunity to sell refurbished Nintendo hardware in Mexico but was prohibited
from selling Sony hardware in Mexico and Nirvana was selling only Sony
hardware in Mexico, this would not constitute a violation under this Section
6.1.2. Conversely, if the Company were able to sell Sony factory refurbished
hardware in Mexico, this would constitute a violation and require Nima
Taghavi and Hossein Taghavi to terminate their respective obligations under
the Consulting Engagement Agreements.



 

The Major Shareholders shall be in breach of this Section 6.1.2 if any of the
foregoing conditions to the exception in paragraph (b) is not met and Nima
Taghavi and Hossein Taghavi did not terminate their respective Consulting
Engagement Agreements within seven days after the date a Major Shareholder
knows that any of the conditions in this paragraph (c) to the exception
in paragraph (b) is not met.

violation of the terms of this Section 6.1.2: (1) any Major Shareholders and

Solutions 2 Go ("Solutions") (but not any other activities), and (2) Nima
Taghavis participation as a board member of Solutions.



(e) The exception referred to in paragraph (d) shall remain in effect only so
long as



(i) the gross margin (to Solutions) determined in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied on any product sold by Solutions to the Company does not
exceed 15%,



(ii) Solutions does not compete with the Company in the United States,



(iii) Solutions does not become the exclusive provider of value interactive

software (including, without limitation, programs or initiatives) in Canada,
and



(v) the Major Shareholders, Global Distributions, LLC and Rob Dyer do not
increase their interest in Solutions.

(e)(v) to the exception in paragraph (d) is not met, (1) the Major
Shareholders that own any equity interest in Solutions, Rob Dyer and Global
Distribution, LLC shall dispose of their equity interests in Solutions to
unaffiliated third parties within 75 days of any of such conditions not being
met, and (2) Nima Taghavi shall no longer be permitted to participate as a  



 

47  board member of Solutions. If the condition in paragraph (e)(iv) to the
exception in paragraph (d) is not met, Nima Taghavi shall no longer
be permitted to participate as a board member of Solutions. The Major
Shareholders shall be in breach of this Section 6.1.2 if any of the conditions
in paragraph (e) to the exception in paragraph (d) is not met.

and undertakings contained in this Section 6.1 relate to matters which are of

Company, and that the amount of such injury will be difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate or determine and cannot adequately be compensated by
monetary damages. Therefore, each of the Shareholders acknowledges that Buyer
and the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and
remedies available under this Agreement and applicable law, as a matter of
course, to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any
court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any of such terms by any of the Shareholders and by such other
persons as the court shall order. Each of the Shareholders waives any
requirement that Buyer or the Company post any bond in connection
with obtaining such relief or in connection with any proceeding or appeal
with respect to any such relief obtained.



6.2 _Further Assurances._

ISI Capital Partners, whose fees, commissions and expenses are the sole
responsibility of the Shareholders, all negotiations relative to this
Agreement and the transactions described in this Agreement have been carried
on by the parties to this Agreement directly without the intervention of any
person, and such negotiations, and the consummation of the transactions under
this Agreement, will not result in any liability by any party or by the
Company for any finders fee, brokerage commission or other similar fee. Each
party (the "Party") shall pay or discharge, and shall indemnify, defend and
hold the other parties harmless from and against, any and all claims or

Any sales, use, transfer, excise, recording, documentary and similar taxes
applicable to the conveyance or transfer of the Securities shall be paid by
the Company, and evidence of the payment of such taxes shall be furnished to
Buyer upon its request.



6.6 _Press Releases._



Except for such disclosure to the parties professional advisors who agree to
keep such information confidential, such disclosure as may be required by
court order or by any law, regulation or stock exchange policy to which a
party is subject, or such disclosure as may be required in order to defend
litigation, no party will issue any press release concerning this Agreement or
any of the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other parties, which shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed. The parties have entered into a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which the parties acknowledge is superseded and

limitation, which debtors, if any, to pursue in court to collect such
receivables. Amounts paid to the Company in connection with such receivables

deemed paid in connection with the oldest undisputed (by the debtor)
receivable of such debtor. Buyer shall assign to the Shareholders any
receivable for which Buyer has been reimbursed pursuant to Sections 1.4 or 1.5

with working capital reasonably required by the Company in accordance with
the operating agreement referred to in Section 4.2.9.



 

49 7 _TAX MATTERS._



The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Buyer and the Shareholders for certain tax matters following the
Closing Date:



7.1 _Tax Indemnification._



Except as accrued in the Financial Statements and included as a liability for
purposes of calculating Working Capital and Net Assets for purposes of
Sections 1.4 and 1.5, the Shareholders, to the extent and from the proceeds of
the Escrow Fund, and the Major Shareholders, unless fully paid from the
principal amount of the Escrow Fund, jointly and severally, shall indemnify
the Company, its subsidiaries, and Buyer, and hold them harmless from and
against, any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to
(1) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its
subsidiaries for all Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_
"), (2) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which the Company or any of its subsidiaries (or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (3)
any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Company, any of
its subsidiaries or any combination of them) imposed on the Company or any of
its subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing. The Shareholders, to the extent and from the
proceeds of the Escrow Fund, and the Major Shareholders, unless fully paid
from the principal amount of the Escrow Fund, jointly and severally, shall
reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any
combination of them which are the responsibility of any of the Shareholders
pursuant to this Section 7.1 within fifteen (15) business days after payment
of such Taxes by Buyer, the Company, or any of its subsidiaries. All
indemnification payments made by the Shareholders pursuant to this Section 7.1
shall be deemed a reduction in the Purchase Price for tax purposes; provided
that if such payment is taxable as income to Buyer, the Shareholders shall
gross up such payment so that after Buyer pays taxes on such payment, it will
have a net amount equal to the amount it would have been entitled to receive
if the payment has not been taxable to Buyer.



7.2 _Straddle Period._



In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the
Company and its subsidiaries for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.



 

50 7.3 _S Corporation Status._



Prior to the Closing, the Company and the Shareholders shall not revoke the
Companys election to be taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of Code
Sections 1361 and 1362. The Company and the Shareholders shall not take or
allow any action that would result in the termination of the Companys status
as a validly electing S corporation within the meaning of Code Sections 1361
and 1362, except for the sale of the Securities to Buyer on the Closing Date
pursuant to this Agreement.



7.4 _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date._



Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all
Tax Returns for the Company and its subsidiaries for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date and shall
provide the Representative with prior written notice and a reasonable time to
review, comment on, and discuss with Buyer such Tax Returns. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, the Shareholders shall include any income, gain,
loss, deduction or other tax items for such periods on their Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s furnished by the Company to the
Shareholders for such periods. Buyer shall not amend any Tax Returns filed by
the Company before Closing without providing the Representative with prior
written notice and a reasonable time to review, comment on, and discuss any
such proposed amended Tax Return, and Buyer shall obtain the Representatives
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before filing any such
amended Tax Return.



7.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters._



(a) Buyer, the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Shareholders shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records
and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided under
this Agreement. The Company and its subsidiaries, the Shareholders, and Buyer
agree (1) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and its subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Shareholders, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (2)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, the Company and its subsidiaries or the Shareholders, as the case
may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.



(b) The Shareholders further agree, upon reasonable request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).



 

51 7.6 _Tax Sharing Agreements._



All tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any combination of them shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, none of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

agreement and understanding of the parties to this Agreement with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. There are no restrictions, promises,
representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings, other than those

oral, between the parties with respect to such subject matter, and any such

8.3 _Governing Law._  



The laws of the State of Delaware shall govern this Agreement, its
construction, and the determination of any rights, duties or remedies of the
parties arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement (regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable Delaware principles of
conflicts of law).



8.4 _Attorneys  Fees._



If any party commences an action against any other party to enforce any
of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Agreement or
because of a default by a party under this Agreement, the prevailing party in

costs and expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of
such action from the losing party.



8.5 _Counterparts._



This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile
signatures.



8.6 _Interpretation._



The headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the purpose
of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and shall not in
any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All references
to "Sections" and "Exhibits" in this Agreement are, unless
specifically indicated otherwise, references to sections of, and exhibits to,
this Agreement. Whenever the singular is used, the same shall include the
plural and vice versa, where appropriate. Words of any gender shall include

part of this Agreement as if set forth in full in this Agreement.



 

53 8.7 _Severability._



If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall have no
effect on the other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain valid,
operative and enforceable. In addition, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and
enforceable.



8.8 _Waiver and Amendments._



 

This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded, cancelled, renewed or
extended, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived,
only by a written instrument signed by the parties or, in the case of a
waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as
a waiver of such right, power or privilege, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any party of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement, nor any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement, preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or
privilege under this Agreement. The rights and remedies under this Agreement
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any party
may otherwise have at law or in equity. The rights and remedies of any party
arising out of, or otherwise in respect of, any inaccuracy in, or breach of,
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission,
occurrence or other state of facts upon which any claim of any such
inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the subject matter of any other
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or Exhibit contained in this
Agreement (or in any other agreement between the parties) as to which there
is no inaccuracy or breach.



8.9  _Binding Effect; Successors and Assigns._



This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and their respective permitted successors and assigns;
provided that the Shareholders may not assign or transfer any of their rights
or delegate any of their obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Buyer, and any purported assignment or transfer by the
Shareholders shall be void; provided, further, that Buyer may assign its
rights and delegate its duties under this Agreement to an affiliate of Buyer
if Buyer guarantees the obligations of such affiliate under this Agreement.
