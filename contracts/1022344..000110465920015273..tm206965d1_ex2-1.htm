WHEREAS, the Parties intend that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a) the

Titanium Series J and Series K Preferred Stock Redemption Amount and the
assumption of all of Titanium's other liabilities (including Titanium's share
of the Titanium OP liabilities, as determined under the applicable U.S.
federal income tax regulations), followed by a distribution of such
consideration to the holders of equity interests in Titanium in liquidation
pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that this Agreement
will constitute a "plan of liquidation" of Titanium for U.S. federal income
tax purposes; (b) the Partnership Merger will be treated as (i) with respect
to Titanium OP Units that are converted into the right to receive the Cash
Partnership Merger Consideration or Titanium Family Partnership Merger
Consideration, a taxable purchase of Titanium OP Units in exchange for the
Cash Partnership Merger Consideration and (ii) with respect to Titanium OP
Units that are converted into the right to receive the OP Unit Partnership
Merger Consideration, a contribution of Titanium OP Units to Silver OP
pursuant to Section 721 of the Code; and (c) the LLC Conversion will be
treated in accordance with Revenue Ruling 95-37, 1995-1 C.B. 130 and Revenue
Ruling 84-52, 1984-1 C.B. 157.

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties
or the holder of any securities of the Parties:

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(a) _Limited Liability Company Interests of Silver Merger Sub 1_.
Each limited liability company interest of Silver Merger Sub 1 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain as an issued
and outstanding limited liability company interest of Surviving Titanium and
shall constitute the only outstanding limited liability company interests of
Surviving Titanium.

  



  

(b) _Excluded Shares of Titanium Common Stock_. Each share of
Titanium Common Stock that is owned by Titanium as treasury stock, by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Titanium, by any of the Silver
Parties or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of any of the
Silver Parties immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Excluded Titanium Common Stock_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Titanium Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.04_ , each share
of Titanium Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Excluded Titanium Common Stock) shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall be converted into the right
to receive $52.50 in cash (the " _Titanium Common Stock Merger Consideration_
") payable to the holder thereof, without interest. All such shares of
Titanium Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Titanium Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Titanium Common Stock Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the
surrender of such certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) in
accordance with _Section 2.04_ , without interest. For the avoidance of doubt,
any Titanium DSUs, Titanium RSU Awards or Titanium PSU Awards that have
vested and have been settled in shares of Titanium Common Stock prior to
Closing (that is, other than those that are outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to Closing and vest pursuant to _Section 2.05_ , which
shall be governed by _Section 2.05_ ) will constitute Titanium Common Stock
converted pursuant to this provision.

  



  

(d) _Titanium Series B Preferred Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.04_ ,
each share of Titanium Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash
equal to the Titanium Common Stock Merger Consideration _divided by_ 14,000
(collectively, the " _Titanium Series B Merger Consideration_ ") payable to
the holder thereof, without interest. All such shares of Titanium Series B
Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Titanium Series B
Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Titanium Series B Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the
surrender of such certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) in
accordance with _Section 2.04_ , without interest.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of
Titanium Common Stock or Titanium Series B Preferred Stock, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into shares of Titanium Common Stock or Titanium
Series B Preferred Stock, in each case shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the
Titanium Common Stock Merger Consideration and/or the Titanium Series B
Merger Consideration, as applicable, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
that change; _provided_ that nothing in this  _Section 2.01(e)_ shall be
construed to permit any Party or its Subsidiaries to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

Section 2.02 _Effect on Partnership Interests_. At the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Partnership Merger and without any
action on the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any securities of
the Parties:

  



  

(a) _Limited Liability Company Interests in Silver Merger Sub 2_.
All of the limited liability company interests of Silver Merger Sub 2 issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time
shall, collectively, be converted into and become a number of units of
partnership interest in Surviving Titanium OP (each, a " _Surviving Titanium
OP Unit_ ") equal to the sum of (i) the sum of (A) the number of Titanium OP
Units owned by the Titanium OP Minority Partners _plus_ (B) the number of
Titanium Family Converting Units, in each case issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and that become
cancelled in the Partnership Merger as provided in _Section 2.02(c)_ and
_Section 2.02(d)_ ,  _plus_ (ii) the number of Acquired Equity Awards, _plus_
(iii) the quotient of the number of shares of Titanium Series B Preferred
Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(d) _divided by_ 14,000.

  



  

(b) _Titanium OP Units Held by Titanium_. Each Titanium OP Unit that
is owned by Titanium immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time (the " _General Partner Units_ ") shall remain outstanding as one
Surviving Titanium OP Unit, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Titanium OP Units owned by
Titanium following the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall equal the
number of shares of Titanium Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 2.01(c)_.

  



  

(c) _Titanium OP Units Held by Titanium OP Minority Partners_.
Subject to _Section 2.04_ , each Titanium OP Unit issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time owned by a holder
of Titanium OP Units other than Surviving Titanium and the Titanium Family
(each such holder, a " _Titanium OP Minority Partner_ ") shall be converted
into, at the election of the holder thereof (which election must be made no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of the procedures
for such election by Silver OP to such holders, which procedures shall be
subject to Titanium's approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and shall be provided to such holders no
later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time), either (i) the Titanium Common Stock Merger
Consideration (the " _Cash Partnership Merger Consideration_ ") or (ii) a
number of Silver OP Units newly and validly issued for such purpose (the "
_New Silver OP Units_ ") equal to the OP Exchange Ratio (the " _OP Unit
Partnership Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Partnership
Merger Consideration, as applicable, the " _Minority OP Partners Partnership
Merger Consideration_ "), in each case, without interest; _provided_ , that if
a Titanium OP Minority Partner does not qualify as an accredited investor as
defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act or does not make a valid and
timely election as provided above or does not deliver the applicable executed
joinder to the Silver OP Agreement as provided below, such Titanium OP
Minority Partner shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Cash
Partnership Merger Consideration pursuant to clause (i) above. Each Titanium
OP Minority Partner who receives New Silver OP Units shall be admitted as a
limited partner of Silver OP in accordance with the terms of the Silver OP
Agreement upon delivery of an executed joinder agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Titanium OP Incentive Units that have vested and have been settled in
Titanium OP Units prior to Closing (that is, other than those that are
outstanding immediately prior to Closing and vest pursuant to _Section
2.02(e)_ , which shall be governed by _Section 2.02(e)_ ) will constitute
Titanium OP Units held by Titanium OP Minority Partners converted pursuant to
this provision.

(d) _Titanium OP Units Held by the Titanium Family_. A number of
Titanium OP Units owned by the Titanium Family (with the allocation of such
Titanium OP Units among certain or all members of the Titanium Family to be
determined by the Titanium Family Representative prior to the Effective Time)
immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time that results in the
Titanium Family owning 20% of the outstanding Surviving Titanium OP Units
(assuming, for purposes of this calculation, that Titanium OP Units issuable
under the Option Deferral Agreement are outstanding Surviving Titanium OP
Units) immediately following the Partnership Merger Effective Time (such
Titanium OP Units, the " _Titanium Family Remaining Units_ ," and together
with the General Partner Units, the " _Excluded Titanium OP Units_ ") shall
remain outstanding as Surviving Titanium OP Units, no payment shall be made
with respect thereto, and the holders of such Surviving Titanium OP Units
(which holders shall be determined by the Titanium Family Representative
prior to the Effective Time) shall remain as general or limited partners (as
applicable) of Surviving Titanium OP. Subject to _Section 2.04_ , all
Titanium OP Units owned by the Titanium Family immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time other than the Titanium Family Remaining
Units (such Titanium OP Units, the " _Titanium Family Converting Units_ ")
shall be converted into the Cash Partnership Merger Consideration (the "
_Titanium Family Partnership Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the
Minority OP Partners Partnership Merger Consideration, the "
_Partnership Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. _Schedule I_ sets
forth an illustration of the calculation described in the first sentence of
this _Section 2.02(d)_ and the effect of the LLC Conversion described in
_Section 2.03_ and the other related transactions contemplated by this
_Article II_ based on information available as of the date hereof.

  



  

(e) _Titanium OP Incentive Units_. Subject to _Section 2.04_ , each
Titanium OP Incentive Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time which by its terms as in effect on
the date hereof vests or is eligible to become vested in connection with the
Effective Time shall (i) to the extent not already vested, become vested
(treating for this purpose any performance-based vesting condition to which
such Titanium OP Incentive Unit remains subject as having been attained based
on the level of Actual Performance through the Effective Time or Target
Performance, whichever is greater) and (ii) be converted, immediately prior
to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, into an outstanding Titanium OP Unit
in accordance with the Titanium Stock Plan pursuant to which such Titanium OP
Incentive Unit was granted, which shall then be treated in the same manner
(and having the right to the same election) as all other Titanium OP Units in
accordance with _Section 2.02(c)_ above (the Cash Partnership Merger
Consideration and/or the OP Unit Partnership Merger Consideration, as
applicable, payable with respect thereto, the " _Incentive Unit Merger
Consideration_ ") _._ Any Incentive Unit Merger Consideration payable with
respect to Titanium OP Incentive Units shall be paid out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with _Section 2.04_. The portion of any such Titanium OP
Incentive Unit that does not become vested following the determination of
performance as set forth in this _Section 2.02(e)_ shall be cancelled and
forfeited immediately prior to the Effective Time without consideration
therefor.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(f) _Treatment of Units_. All Titanium OP Units converted into the
applicable Partnership Merger Consideration, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of units in book-entry
form) that immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time
represented any such Titanium OP Units shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Partnership
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled upon the surrender of such certificate (or evidence
of shares in book-entry form) as provided herein, without interest.

  



  

(g) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the
date of this Agreement and the Partnership Merger Effective Time the
outstanding Silver Common Stock, Silver OP Units, Titanium OP Units or
Titanium OP Incentive Units shall have been changed into a different number
of units or a different class, by reason of any dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of units,
or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Minority OP Partners
Partnership Merger Consideration, and/or the Titanium Family Partnership
Merger Consideration, and/or the Incentive Unit Merger Consideration,
as applicable, will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of
Silver OP Units, Titanium OP Units and/or Titanium OP Incentive Units the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.02(g)_ shall be construed to
permit any Party or its Subsidiaries to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.03 _Effect of LLC Conversion_. At the LLC Conversion
Effective Time, by virtue of the LLC Conversion and without any action on the
part of any of the Parties or the holder of any securities of the Parties:

  



  

(a) _Interests of the Titanium Family_. Each Surviving Titanium OP
Unit held by the Titanium Family immediately prior to the LLC Conversion
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one Reorganized Titanium
OP Unit, such that the Titanium Family will hold 20% of the Reorganized
Titanium OP Units (assuming, for purposes of this calculation, that
Reorganized Titanium OP Units issuable under the Option Deferral Agreement
are outstanding Reorganized Titanium OP Units), and each applicable member of
the Titanium Family shall become a member of the Reorganized Titanium
Operating Company.

  



  

(b) _Interests of Titanium_. Each Surviving Titanium OP Unit held by
Titanium immediately prior to the LLC Conversion Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into one Reorganized Titanium OP Unit, such that

Titanium OP Units (assuming, for purposes of this calculation, that
Reorganized Titanium OP Units issuable under the Option Deferral Agreement
are outstanding Reorganized Titanium OP Units), and Surviving Titanium shall
become a member of the Reorganized Titanium Operating Company.

(12) months after the Effective Time or the Partnership Merger Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), as
applicable, shall be delivered to Silver or its designee, and any holder of
Titanium Common Stock, Titanium Series B Preferred Stock, Titanium OP Units
or Titanium OP Incentive Units who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Silver for payment of its claim
for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_ , in each case without any
interest thereon.

  



  

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
the cash in the Exchange Fund if and as directed by Silver; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper
rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion, and that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to this
_Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to, and be the property of, Silver. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of
any shareholder of Titanium or unitholder of Titanium OP to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To
the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt

hereof, Silver shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Silver, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Silver may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the
applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions on such
Certificate, in each case deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(j) _Dividends and Distributions_. In the event that (i) a
dividend or distribution with respect to the shares of Titanium Common Stock
permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (A) a record date prior to the
Effective Time and (B) has not been paid as of the Effective Time, or (ii) a
dividend or distribution with respect to the Titanium OP Units permitted under
the terms of this Agreement has (A) a record date prior to the Partnership

exchanged pursuant to this _Article II_.

Section 2.05 _Treatment of Titanium Equity Awards_. Prior to the

committee administering any Titanium Stock Plan) will take all actions as it
deems necessary or appropriate to give effect to this _Section 2.05_ to
provide that, other than as agreed to in writing between Titanium and a
holder of each Titanium Equity Award:

  



  

(a) _Titanium RSU Awards and Titanium DSUs_. Except as otherwise
provided in _Section 2.05(c)_ , immediately prior to, and conditioned upon
the occurrence of, the Effective Time, each Titanium RSU Award, other than a
Titanium 2020 Equity Award, that is then outstanding and which by its terms
as in effect on the date hereof vests in full in connection with the
Effective Time, and each Titanium DSU, shall, without any action by the
holder thereof, become vested in full (as applicable) and shall be converted
into the right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Titanium Common
Stock subject to such Titanium RSU Award or Titanium DSU, as applicable, and
(ii) the Titanium Common Stock Merger Consideration. Any Titanium Common
Stock Merger Consideration payable with respect such Titanium RSU Awards and
Titanium DSUs shall be paid as soon as practicable, and in any event within
five (5) Business Days, following the Effective Time and subject to any
required withholding taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Titanium RSU Awards or
Titanium DSUs which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the applicable settlement date for such Titanium RSU Awards or Titanium DSUs
if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(b) _Titanium PSU Awards_. Immediately prior to, and conditioned
upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, each Titanium PSU Award,
other than a Titanium 2020 Equity Award, that is then outstanding which by
its terms as in effect on the date hereof is eligible to become vested in
connection with the Effective Time shall, without any action by the holder
thereof, become vested (determined based on the level of Actual Performance
or Target Performance, whichever is greater) and shall be converted into the
right of the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Titanium Common Stock
subject to the vested portion of such Titanium PSU Award and (ii) the Titanium
Common Stock Merger Consideration. Any Titanium Common Stock Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Titanium PSU Awards shall be paid
as soon as practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days,
following the Effective Time and subject to any required withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of any Titanium PSU Awards which immediately prior to such
cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of
the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Titanium
PSU Awards if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The
portion of such Titanium PSU Award described in this _Section 2.05(b)_ that
does not become vested following the determination of performance as set
forth in this _Section 2.05(b)_ shall be cancelled and forfeited immediately
prior to the Effective Time without consideration therefor.

  



  

(c) _Substitute Titanium RSU and PSU Awards_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the case of any Titanium RSU Award and any Titanium PSU Award,
in each case other than a Titanium 2020 Equity Award, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which is not, by its terms, eligible
to become vested upon the Effective Time, such Titanium RSU Award or Titanium
PSU Award shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any action
by the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall be converted into a substitute
award in respect thereof, in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Titanium Stock Plan (assuming, for any applicable Titanium PSU Award,
achievement of performance conditions at the greater of Target Performance or
Actual Performance) (a " _Substitute Award_ "), which Substitute Award shall
constitute a right to receive, on a per share basis with respect to the
portion of such Substitute Award that vests, a cash payment payable by
Reorganized Titanium Operating Company equal to the Titanium Common Stock
Merger Consideration (the " _Titanium RSU/PSU Cash Amount_ "). Each Substitute
Award shall continue to be subject to the same service-vesting schedule that
applied to the original Titanium RSU Award or Titanium PSU Award to which
it relates (with any Substitute Award granted in respect of a Titanium PSU
Award vesting solely subject to service conditions being satisfied through
the end of the originally scheduled performance period (or as otherwise
provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable Titanium Stock Plan
and applicable Titanium PSU Award agreement)), and the applicable Titanium
RSU/PSU Cash Amount that vests and becomes payable shall be paid at such time
as the previously corresponding share of Titanium Common Stock
would otherwise have become vested and deliverable under the applicable
Titanium RSU Award or Titanium PSU Award in accordance with its original
service vesting schedule.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the case of any Titanium RSU Award and any Titanium PSU Award,
in each case that is a Titanium 2020 Equity Award and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Titanium RSU Award or Titanium
PSU Award shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any action
by the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall be converted into a substitute
award in respect thereof, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Titanium Stock Plan (a " _2020 Substitute Award_ "), which 2020
Substitute Award shall constitute a right to receive, on a per share basis
with respect to the portion of such Substitute Award that vests, a cash
payment payable by Reorganized Titanium Operating Company equal to the
Titanium RSU/PSU Cash Amount. Each 2020 Substitute Award shall continue to be
subject to the same vesting schedule that applied to the original Titanium
RSU Award or Titanium PSU Award to which it relates, and the
applicable Titanium RSU/PSU Cash Amount that vests and becomes payable shall
be paid at such time as the previously corresponding share of Titanium Common
Stock would otherwise have become vested and deliverable under the applicable
Titanium RSU Award or Titanium PSU Award in accordance with its original
vesting schedule.

  



  

(d) _Treatment of Titanium DERs_. Conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Effective Time, upon the Effective Time: (i) each Titanium DER
that relates to a then outstanding Titanium RSU Award or Titanium PSU Award,
in each case other than a Titanium 2020 Equity Award, and which by its terms
(A) is, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, already vested, or (B)
is eligible to become vested in connection with the Effective Time, shall,
without any action by the holder thereof, become vested (to the extent not
previously vested) to the same extent as the Titanium RSU Award or Titanium
PSU Award to which such Titanium DER relates in accordance with  _Section
2.05(a)_ or _Section 2.05(b)_ above, as applicable, and in each case of (A)
and (B) shall, to the extent not theretofore paid, become immediately due and
payable in accordance with its terms and, upon payment in full thereof in
accordance with its terms, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time; and
(ii) in the case of any Titanium DER that relates to a then
outstanding Titanium RSU Award or Titanium PSU Award, in each case including
any Titanium 2020 Equity Award, which is not, by its terms, eligible to
become vested upon the Effective Time, such Titanium DER shall, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, without any action by the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall be converted into a Substitute DER. For the avoidance of
doubt, any payment in respect of any Titanium DER which immediately prior to
the cancellation thereof was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to
Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for
such Titanium DER (or Substitute DER, as applicable) if required in order to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(e) _Necessary Actions_. Titanium shall use reasonable best efforts
to, prior to the Effective Time, take or cause to be taken all actions as are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.05_. Titanium shall provide Silver the opportunity to review and provide
comments with respect to any written materials with respect thereto in
advance of their adoption or distribution to holders of Titanium Equity
Awards, which comments shall be considered and taken into account by the
Titanium in good faith.

  



  

(f) _Option Deferral Agreement_. At the LLC Conversion Effective
Time, the Option Deferral Agreement shall be deemed to be amended so
that each Option Deferred Unit shall represent the right to receive,
following the LLC Conversion Effective Time, one Reorganized Titanium OP Unit
(" _Reorganized Titanium OP Deferred Unit "_), with such Reorganized Titanium
OP Deferred Unit remaining subject to all other terms and conditions of the
Option Deferral Agreement (including the continued right to receive
distributions in the same manner and in the same amount as received by any
other Reorganized Titanium OP Unit). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the parties to the Option Deferral Agreement shall be permitted to
amend the Option Deferral Agreement to give effect to this _Section 2.05(f)_.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(g) _Funding of Closing Payments_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Silver shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with Titanium OP or a
Subsidiary thereof, for the benefit of the holders of the applicable Titanium
RSU Awards, Titanium PSU Awards and Titanium DSUs, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the
aggregate amount of Titanium Common Stock Merger Consideration payable with
respect to Titanium RSU Awards and Titanium DSUs pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_
, _plus _ (ii) the aggregate amount of Titanium Common Stock Merger
Consideration payable with respect to Titanium PSU Awards pursuant to
_Section 2.05(b)_ , _plus_ (iii) the aggregate amount payable with respect to
Titanium DERs pursuant to _Section 2.05(d)(i)_.

  



  

Section 2.06 _Treatment of Titanium Series J and Series K Preferred
Stock_. On the Closing Date, each share of Titanium Series J Preferred Stock
and each share of Titanium Series K Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be redeemed in accordance with
the terms of _Section 6.08_ , and from and after the Effective Time, shall no
longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares
shall terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price therefor
_plus_ all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, without interest.

  



  

Section 2.07 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Silver and the Exchange
Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Titanium Common Stock,
Titanium Series B Preferred Stock, Titanium Series J Preferred Stock,
Titanium Series K Preferred Stock, Titanium DSUs, Titanium RSU Awards,
Titanium PSU Awards, Titanium OP Units, or Titanium OP Incentive Units
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax law.
Amounts so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Titanium Common Stock, Titanium Series B Preferred Stock,
Titanium Series J Preferred Stock, Titanium Series K Preferred Stock,
Titanium DSUs, Titanium RSU Awards, Titanium PSU Awards, Titanium OP Units,
or Titanium OP Incentive Units in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. In the event that Silver or the Exchange Agent
determines that withholding is required, Silver or the Exchange Agent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Titanium in advance and the
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or minimize such withholding
to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

recommend that the Titanium Shareholders adopt and approve this Agreement;
and (iv) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Titanium

its capacity as the general partner of Titanium OP, has taken all actions
required for the execution of this Agreement by Titanium OP and to approve
the consummation by Titanium OP of the Transactions. The Titanium Board,
acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Titanium Special Committee,
has directed that Titanium submit the adoption and approval of this
Agreement to a vote at a special meeting of the shareholders of Titanium in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the " _Titanium Shareholders
Meeting_ "). Except for Titanium Shareholder Approval and the Titanium OP
Approval, no other corporate or other similar proceedings on the part of the

(c) Assuming the representation and warranty set forth in _Section
4.09_ is true and correct in all respects, (i) the Titanium Board, acting

price,"  "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation (collectively, "
_Takeover Laws_ ") applies with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. The Titanium Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of
the Titanium Special Committee, has adopted a resolution determining that
none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Voting Agreement
or the performance of any of the obligations or agreements contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the consummation of the Transactions (including
the Merger), assuming no breach or default of such agreements by the Titanium
Family, will result in any Person in the Titanium Family having
Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership (as such terms are defined in
the Titanium Charter) of more than 8.23% of the value of the outstanding
Titanium Common Stock and Titanium Series B Preferred Stock, in aggregate, or
otherwise result in any Capital Stock (as defined in the Titanium Charter)

Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the making or
submission of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) participate in, knowingly facilitate or engage in discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
any offer, proposal or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than informing such Persons of the existence
of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.02(b)_ or contacting such
Person or its Representatives solely to clarify the terms and conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal); (iv) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, investment agreement, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an
Acquisition Transaction or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any
such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other Contract providing for an Acquisition
Transaction an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (v) reimburse or
agree to reimburse the expenses of any other Person (other than the Titanium
Parties' Representatives) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal. From the No-Shop Period Start Date until the
earlier to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, Titanium will be required to enforce,
and will not be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal
being made to Titanium or the Titanium Board (or the Titanium
Special Committee), unless the Titanium Special Committee has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take
such action (I) would prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal to the Titanium Board or Titanium Special Committee in
compliance with this _Section 5.02_ and (II) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, including the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date,
from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Titanium Parties and their
respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described
in _Section 5.02(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Party (and its
Representatives), including with respect to any amended or modified
Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the No-Shop
Period Start Date, and the restrictions in this _Section 5.02(b)_ shall not
apply with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Superior Proposals and Other Exceptions_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from the No-Shop Period Start
Date and continuing until Titanium's receipt of the Titanium Shareholder
Approval, the Titanium Parties may, directly or indirectly through one or
more of their Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to Titanium or
any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of Titanium or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to, any Person that has made, renewed or delivered
to Titanium an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement or to
such Person's Representatives (including potential financing sources of such
Person), and otherwise facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or assist such
Person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition
Proposal (in each case, if requested by such Person), in each case with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a material
breach of _Section 5.02(a)_ or _Section 5.02(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Titanium Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with the Titanium Special Committee's fiduciary duties
pursuant to Applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, subject to
Applicable Law, any non-public information concerning the Titanium Parties
that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 5.02(c)_ that was not previously made available to Silver shall be
provided or made available to Silver promptly (and, in any event, within 12
hours) following such time as it is provided or made available to such third
party.

(d) _No Change in Titanium Board Recommendation or Entry into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except as permitted by _Section 5.02(e)_
, at no time after the date of this Agreement may the Titanium Board (or the
Titanium Special Committee):

  



  

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, the Titanium Board Recommendation (in
the case of amendments or modifications, in any manner adverse to Silver); (B)
adopt, approve or recommend to the Titanium Shareholders, or publicly propose
to adopt, approve or recommend to the Titanium Shareholders, an Acquisition
Proposal; (C) fail to include the Titanium Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or (D) make any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for the equity securities of Titanium other than a
recommendation against such offer, or make any other public statement in
connection with such offer that does not expressly reaffirm the Titanium Board
Recommendation (any action described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), a "
_Titanium Board Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination by the Titanium
Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; (2) the taking of any action contemplated by
_Section 5.02(c)_ as and to the extent permitted by _Section 5.02(e)(i)_ ; or
(3) the delivery by Titanium of any notice contemplated by _Section 5.02(e)_
; or (4) any "stop, look and listen" communication by Titanium, the Titanium
Board or the Titanium Special Committee pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication) will constitute a
Titanium Board Recommendation Change; or

  



  

(ii) cause or permit Titanium or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Titanium Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Titanium Shareholder Approval:

  



  

(i) if Titanium has received a written Acquisition Proposal that the
Titanium Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Titanium Special
Committee) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
Titanium Board (acting on the recommendation of the Titanium Special
Committee) may (x) effect a Titanium Board Recommendation Change with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal or (y) authorize Titanium to terminate
this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) shall not take any action
described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless:

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(A)  the Titanium Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Titanium Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law;

  



  

(B)  (i) Titanium has provided prior written notice to Silver at
least four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") to the effect
that the Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) has (A) received a
Superior Proposal and (B) intends to take the actions described in clauses
(A) or (B) of this _Section 5.02(e)(i)_ absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
actions, including a summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and a copy of the definitive proposed transaction
agreement and all ancillary agreements and, to the extent containing terms
material to such Acquisition Proposal, related schedules (other than any
confidential disclosure schedules solely of the Person or Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal), in each case to be entered into in respect of such
Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to taking such actions described in
clauses (A) or (B) of this _Section 5.02(e)(i)_ , Titanium and its
Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have negotiated with Silver
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Silver desires to
so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special Committee)
would no longer determine that the failure to make a Titanium Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Acquisition Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law; _provided_
,  _however_ , that in the event of any material revisions to such
Acquisition Proposal (including any change in price), Titanium shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Silver and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.02(e)(i)(B)_  with respect to such new
written notice (it being understood that the " _Notice Period_ " in respect of
such new written notice will be three Business Days); and

  



  

(C)  in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order
to cause or permit Titanium or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
Titanium shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.01(d)_ , including paying (or causing to be paid) the Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_ ;

  



  

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the
Titanium Board (acting on the recommendation of the Titanium Special
Committee) may effect a Titanium Board Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Titanium Board (acting on the recommendation of the
Titanium Special Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special
Committee) shall not effect such a Titanium Board Recommendation Change
unless:

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(A)  Titanium has provided prior written notice to Silver at least
four Business Days in advance to the effect that the Titanium Board (acting
on the recommendation of the Titanium Special Committee) has (A) so determined
and (B) resolved to effect a Titanium Board Recommendation Change pursuant to
this _Section 5.02(e)(ii)_ , which notice will specify and describe the facts
and circumstances relating to the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable
detail and the factual bases for the Titanium Board's determination that such
events or circumstances constitute an Intervening Event; and

  



  

(B)  prior to effecting such Titanium Board Recommendation
Change, Titanium and its Representatives, during such four Business Day
period, must have negotiated with Silver and its Representatives in good faith
(to the extent that Silver desires to so negotiate) to allow Silver to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the
need to effect a Titanium Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event, and following such four Business Day period, the Titanium
Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) shall have determined (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking
into account Silver's proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) in good faith that the failure to make a Titanium Board
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that each time material modifications to the Intervening
Event occur, Titanium shall notify Silver of such modifications and the four
Business Day period set forth above shall recommence provided that such time
period shall instead be three Business Days from the day of such notification.

  



  

(f) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the
Effective Time, Titanium shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours)
notify Silver if any Acquisition Proposal is received by the Titanium Board
of Directors or the Titanium Special Committee. Such notice must include a
summary of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
(but, prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, need not include the name of
the Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal). After the No-Shop
Period Start Date, such notice shall include an unredacted copy of any
written Acquisition Proposal received and any other written terms or proposal
provided (including financing commitments) and any material modifications
thereto. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, Titanium must keep Silver reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of
the status and material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including any material amendments thereto and any additional written
materials (including financing commitments)) (but, prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date, need not include the name of the Person or Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal). No later than twenty-four hours following the No-Shop
Period Start Date, Titanium shall notify Silver in writing of the identity of
each Person from whom Silver received an Acquisition Proposal after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, and
deliver (i) an unredacted copy of the most recent Acquisition Proposal made
in writing and any material modifications thereto and any other written
terms or proposal provided (including financing commitments) and any material
modifications thereto and (ii) a written summary of the material terms of any
Acquisition Proposal not made in writing and any material modifications
thereto.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will prohibit Titanium or the
Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) from (i) taking and
disclosing to Titanium Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, including making a "stop, look and listen"

in this _Section 5.02_ ; (iv) including a factually accurate description with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal in the "Background of the Merger" section
of the Proxy Statement or in any other documents required to be filed or
furnished to the SEC by Titanium in which such description of an Acquisition
Proposal is required, in each case, solely in the event that such Proxy
Statement or such other document also includes the Titanium Board
Recommendation; or (v) making any disclosure to the Titanium Shareholders
unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (including regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Titanium and its Subsidiaries)
that the Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) has determined to
make in good faith, it being understood that any such statement or disclosure
made by the Titanium Board (or the Titanium Special Committee) must be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that any such
disclosure or communication that constitutes a Titanium Board
Recommendation Change shall only be made in accordance with _Section
5.02(e)_. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement, the making of a "stop, look and listen" communication to Titanium
Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act will
not be deemed to be a Titanium Board Recommendation Change or otherwise a
violation of this _Section 5.02_.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03(b)_ , each Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause

the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Titanium, Silver nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to make, or commit or
agree to make, any concession or payment to, or incur any liability to, any
such non-Governmental Entity to obtain any such Consent. The Parties shall
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental
Entities, including in connection with any of the foregoing Filings or to
determine whether any such Filings are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions.

Titanium shall defend any Action commenced by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions and (ii) Silver shall take or cause to be
taken, do or cause to be done, propose, negotiate, commit to, agree to and
effect (A) the sale, divestiture, lease or other disposition of any assets,
businesses or properties of Silver or Titanium or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, (B) any other action, commitment, condition, contingency,

Closing would limit either of Silver's or Titanium's freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of Silver's or Titanium's or their
respective Subsidiaries' assets, businesses or properties or their interests
therein, in each case to the extent necessary to resolve objections, if any,
that a Governmental Entity asserts (or threatens to assert) under any
Applicable Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Applicable Law asserted by any such
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, in each case so as to
enable the Closing to occur prior to the End Date and (C) any hold separate
orders as are necessary in order to avoid, or effect the dissolution of, any
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction preventing the closing
of the Transactions (such actions described in this clause (ii), collectively,

anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Silver Party shall be
permitted to, and no Titanium Party shall be required to (and no Titanium
Party shall), in each case without the prior written consent of the Titanium
Family Representative, commit to, agree to or make any Regulatory Concessions
that would result in a Titanium Burdensome Condition; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(x) Silver and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to commit to or make any
Regulatory Concessions that would result in a Silver Burdensome Condition or
that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions, (y)
no Titanium Party shall be permitted to (and no Titanium Party shall) offer

and its Subsidiaries and of Silver and its Subsidiaries. As used herein, (1) "
_Titanium  Burdensome Condition_" means any sale, divestiture, lease or other

Parties in connection with (1) any Filing contemplated by this _Section 5.03_
and any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
response to questions or information or document requests from any
Governmental Entity, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with

any governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding initiated by a private
party, and (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed and on a reasonably
timely basis of any communication received by such Party from, or given by

 Additional Agreements

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, Titanium shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC
a proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the shareholders
of Titanium at the Titanium Shareholders Meeting (such proxy statement, and
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Subject
to  _Section 5.02_ , the Titanium Board shall make the Titanium Board
Recommendation to Titanium's shareholders and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of Titanium and Silver shall
furnish all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the
other, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by
such other party to be included therein and shall otherwise assist and
cooperate with the other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the
resolution of any comments to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC.
Titanium and Silver shall promptly notify the other Parties and correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, whether by misstatement or omission. Titanium and Silver shall notify
the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
and shall supply the other with copies of all written correspondence between

definitive version of, disseminate, or cause the dissemination of, the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. Prior

to review and to propose comments on such document or response, which the
party receiving such comments shall consider in good faith.

Titanium Board Recommendation Change, Titanium shall take all necessary
actions in accordance with Applicable Law, the Titanium Charter, the Titanium
By-laws and the rules of NYSE to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Titanium Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Titanium
Shareholder Approval, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement; _provided_
, that Titanium shall not be obligated to call the Titanium Shareholders
Meeting prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. Subject to _Section 5.02_ ,

Titanium may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone the
Titanium Shareholders Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required information is provided to the shareholders of Titanium within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Titanium Shareholders Meeting or
(ii) if as of the time for which the Titanium Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Titanium Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Titanium Shareholders Meeting or to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies to the extent Titanium reasonably believes
necessary in order to obtain the Titanium Shareholder Approval; _provided_
that in no event shall the Titanium Shareholders Meeting be adjourned,
recessed or postponed on more than two occasions, and in each such instance
by more than 15 Business Days from the previously scheduled date of such
meeting, unless required by Applicable Law or with the consent of Silver.

  



  

(c)  If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with
respect to Silver or any of its Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by Silver for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Silver shall promptly notify Titanium of
such event, and Silver and Titanium shall cooperate in the prompt filing with
the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and,

6.01(a)_.

respect to Titanium or any of its Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by Titanium for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Titanium shall promptly notify Silver of
such event, and Titanium and Silver shall cooperate in the prompt filing with
the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
and, as required by Applicable Law, in disseminating the information

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
Applicable Law, Titanium agrees that it shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford Silver and Silver's Representatives reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance written notice and during normal business
hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties
(other than for purposes of invasive testing), books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, Titanium shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Silver all other
information (other than information regarding any Acquisition Proposal)
concerning its business, properties and personnel as may be reasonably
requested (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any material
respect with the normal business operations of Titanium or its Subsidiaries);
_provided_ , _however_ , that all such access shall be coordinated through
Titanium or its Representatives in accordance with such procedures as they may
reasonably establish; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Titanium shall not
be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, if such disclosure
or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or any other Contract with a third party, (ii)
result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege, (iii) violate or
materially impair the contractual rights of its customers and tenants or (iv)
violate any Applicable Law, it being agreed that, with respect to subclauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), Titanium shall use its reasonable efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in such loss,
violation or impairment, including by seeking a waiver from the relevant
third party. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Titanium shall not be required to provide any access or make any
disclosure to the other pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ to the extent such
access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where Titanium
or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Silver or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties or reasonably likely to
become adverse parties. Titanium may reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be provided to Silver under this _Section 6.02_ as
"Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of Silver and will
not be disclosed by such outside legal counsel to employees (including in-
house legal counsel), officers, directors or other independent contractors
(including accountants and expert witnesses) of Silver unless express
permission is obtained in advance from Titanium or its legal counsel. All
information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2019, between
Titanium and Silver (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(a)  Surviving Titanium and the Reorganized Titanium Operating
Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Silver shall cause such entities to)
honor and fulfill the obligations of Titanium and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
any indemnification or other similar agreements of Titanium, Titanium OP or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, which agreements shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law (including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
any amendments to or replacements of the MBCA, DGCL, DLLCA or DRULPA adopted
after the date of this Agreement that increase the amount to which a
corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership may
indemnify its officers and directors) each of Silver and Reorganized Titanium
Operating Company agrees that Reorganized Titanium Operating Company will
(and Silver will cause such entity to) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who was or is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes

liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement
and fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements,
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative, to the extent related
to matters existing or occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the

to the fact that Titanium Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or
employee of Titanium, Titanium OP or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or is or was serving at the request of Titanium, Titanium OP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another Person,

entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such Action
from Reorganized Titanium Operating Company within ten Business Days of
receipt by Reorganized Titanium Operating Company from such Titanium
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom

ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled
to indemnification and (y) Silver, Silver OP, Surviving Titanium, Surviving
Titanium OP, the Reorganized Titanium Operating Company and their respective
Subsidiaries shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter. Without
limiting the foregoing, to the extent the Titanium Charter, Titanium By-laws,
Titanium OP Agreement, the Organizational Documents of their respective

insurance coverage currently maintained by Titanium and/or Titanium OP, such
tail to provide coverage for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and

currently maintained by Titanium or Titanium OP with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
so long as the aggregate cost for each year of such "tail" policy does not
exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Titanium or

respective Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for Titanium, Titanium
OP and their respective current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by Titanium or Titanium OP in either
case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less
favorable to the insured persons in the aggregate than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by Titanium or Titanium OP with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time
(with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance), except that in no event shall Surviving Titanium,
Surviving Titanium OP or the Reorganized Titanium Operating Company be
required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one
policy year more than the Maximum Amount, and if Surviving Titanium,
Surviving Titanium OP and the Reorganized Titanium Operating Company are
unable to (and Silver is unable to cause such entities to) obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 6.03_ it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within
such period. Surviving Titanium, Surviving Titanium OP and the Reorganized
Titanium Operating Company each shall (and Silver shall cause such entities
to) maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder. To the extent premiums for any such
insurance under this _Section 6.03_ are paid for by Silver, Silver OP or
Surviving Titanium, such payor shall be reimbursed as incurred by Reorganized
Titanium Operating Company.

financial statements, it being understood that Silver shall be responsible
for preparing any pro forma adjustments and financial statements giving
effect to the Transactions), including updates to any such information as may
be reasonably requested by Silver (including so as to remain current pursuant
to Rule 3-12 under Regulation S-X) ( _provided_ that to the extent any such
financial information is contained in any Titanium SEC Documents, such
inclusion shall constitute delivery to Silver and its financing sources
hereunder and consent by Titanium and its Subsidiaries to use of such
information); (iii) cause Titanium's independent accountants to prepare and
deliver "comfort letters," dated the date of each final offering document used
in connection with any securities offering by Silver (with appropriate bring-
down comfort letters delivered on each closing date of any such

capacity on the part of any Representative that is an individual or, to the
extent not subject to reimbursement or indemnification by Silver hereunder,
any other liability on the part of any Representative, (4) no action shall be
required to the extent such action could reasonably be expected to cause any
representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement to be
breached, (5) no action shall be required to the extent that it could
reasonably be expected to conflict with the Organizational Documents of any
of the Titanium Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
Applicable Law or could reasonably be expected to result in a violation or
breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both)
under, any contract to which any of the Titanium Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a party or is bound by, (6) would require any of
the Titanium Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives to provide access to or disclose information that the

(7) no action shall be required to the extent such action could reasonably be
expected to cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to
fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement. Silver

condition to the Closing.

Representatives shall have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to
any Person under or in connection with, the arrangement of any financing that

harmless Titanium, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of any financing
that Silver may obtain or seek to obtain in connection with the Transactions
(including any equity financing), any cooperation contemplated by this
_Section 6.05_ , and any information utilized in connection therewith;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any
liabilities to the extent resulting from (i) a Willful Breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant or agreement of Titanium under this
Agreement, (ii) gross negligence or (iii) fraud, in each case as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable
judgment.

  



  

(c)  Titanium will use its reasonable best efforts to provide,
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide,

that in the reasonable judgment of Titanium Board, upon advice of counsel to
Titanium, is reasonably necessary for Titanium to maintain its qualification

that may be required from certain lenders under loan documents of Titanium or
any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Loan Consents_ ") and from certain lessors
under ground leases of Titanium or its Subsidiaries (the " _Ground Lease
Consents_ ") or joint venture partners under joint venture or partnership
documents of Titanium or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _JV Consents_ ", and
together with the Loan Consents and Ground Lease Consents, the " _Specified
Consents_ "). Titanium shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain each of the Specified Consents
promptly after the date of this Agreement, except as may otherwise be agreed
to between Silver and Titanium. Silver shall cooperate and assist Titanium in
connection with soliciting and obtaining any Specified Consents, including the
preparation and delivery of any information relating to Silver or any of its
Affiliates and all other information required under the applicable loan,
ground lease or joint venture documents and as may be reasonably requested by
any such joint venture partner, lessor, lender or any loan servicer on behalf
of any lender. Titanium shall use reasonable best efforts to keep Silver
apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any lessor, joint venture partner, lender or any loan
servicer with respect to the Specified Consents. Without limiting the
foregoing, Titanium shall (i) give Silver a reasonable opportunity (and in any
event no less than twenty-four (24) hours) to review and comment on all
material materials or documents with respect to the Specified Consents and
Titanium shall consider the reasonable comments of Silver thereon in good
faith, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to keep Silver apprised of and,
to the extent reasonably practicable, provide Representatives of Silver
reasonable opportunity to participate in, any material meeting or scheduled
discussion with any lender or any loan servicer with respect to the Loan
Consents. All out-of-pocket consent/assumption fees and expenses, including
out-of-pocket legal fees for joint venture partners, lessors, lenders and/or
servicers (to the extent such fees and expenses are payable pursuant to the
applicable joint venture, ground lease or loan document), incurred in
connection with seeking the Specified Consents, shall be borne by Titanium OP
or its Subsidiaries. Titanium is authorized for itself and on behalf of its
Subsidiaries to enter into amendments or modifications of the applicable loan,
ground lease or joint venture documents as Titanium deems necessary to obtain
such Specified Consents, subject to the terms of _Section 6.13(b)_.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b)  With respect to the Loan Consents, without the prior
consent of Silver (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i) neither Titanium nor its
Representatives on its behalf shall agree to amend, modify, supplement
or waive the terms and conditions of the outstanding indebtedness or
guarantees thereof in order to change any of the parties subject to the
obligations of such indebtedness or guarantees of Titanium or its Subsidiaries
(other than as a result of the Transactions) or materially increase any
recourse obligations of a Subsidiary or the guarantor or replacement guarantor
following the Closing, and (ii) neither Titanium nor its Subsidiaries shall
make any material financial or other covenant modifications or establish
any material reserves, cash sweep requirements or cash traps in connection
with obtaining the Loan Consents. With respect to any JV Consents and Ground
Lease Consents, without the prior consent of Silver (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (x) neither Titanium nor
its Representatives on its behalf shall agree to amend, modify, supplement or
waive the terms and conditions of the applicable ground lease or joint
venture documents in a manner that is material and adverse to Titanium
and its Subsidiaries or Silver and its Subsidiaries, and (y) neither Titanium
nor its Subsidiaries shall make any material payments other than those which
are regularly scheduled or required or are legal or administrative fees.

  



  

(c)  In the event any Loan Consent is not obtained prior to the
date that is 100 days after the date of this Agreement, Titanium and Titanium
OP shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts
to attempt to secure a binding commitment or other similar documentation
reasonably acceptable to Silver that would allow Titanium or its Subsidiaries
to, at the Closing, prepay, or defease the applicable financing and replace
such financing on commercially reasonable, market terms, which shall
be reasonably acceptable to Silver. In the event that any Loan Consent is not
obtained and Titanium or its Subsidiaries have not prepaid or defeased the
applicable financing for which such Loan Consent was required to be obtained
(or obtained a binding commitment or other similar documentation reasonably
acceptable to Silver from a lender to effect such prepayment or defeasance on
the Closing Date) within 130 days after the date of this Agreement or by the
Titanium Shareholders Meeting (whichever is earlier), Silver shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to provide replacement financing to the
applicable Subsidiary of Titanium on commercially reasonable market economic
terms with respect to the loan for which the consent has not been obtained and
which has not otherwise been refinanced by Titanium or its Subsidiaries (or
for which such a binding commitment or other documentation has not been
obtained). Any replacement financing provided by Silver shall be in an amount
sufficient for the Subsidiary of Titanium to prepay or defease such original
loan and shall be on substantially similar loan documents as were executed in
connection with the borrowing of the original loan (including mortgages,
indemnities, guaranties, pledges, other collateral agreements, opinions and
other customary loan deliverables and diligence materials); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any replacement financing made by Silver or its Subsidiaries
with respect to an unsecured loan may be made on a secured basis, subject to
the next sentence. Titanium and Titanium OP shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Silver to enable Silver to provide
any such applicable replacement financing on a secured basis, including by
facilitating the creation and perfection of Liens (including mortgages
and equity pledges) required by Silver; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Titanium and its
Subsidiaries will not be required to agree to any secured loan or facilitate
any Liens that would violate the terms of any Indebtedness (other than
Indebtedness that is being repaid) or joint venture agreement to which
Titanium or its Subsidiaries are a party.

being understood that the Titanium Parties, collectively, and the Silver
Parties, collectively, shall each be deemed a single Party for purposes of
the foregoing proviso);

Parties, collectively, and the Silver Parties, collectively, shall each be
deemed a single Party for purposes of the foregoing proviso); or

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(iii) if the Titanium Shareholder Approval shall not have been

termination under this _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ , Silver would have been
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ ;

  



  

(c) by Titanium, if any of the Silver Parties has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of any of the Silver Parties has become untrue, in
each case, such that, if such breach or failure to be true occurs or
continues on the Closing Date, the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_
or _Section 7.03(b)_ , as the case may be, would not be satisfied as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Titanium may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ unless any such breach or failure
to be true (x) is not capable of being cured in a manner sufficient to allow
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section
7.03(b)_  prior to the End Date or (y) has not been cured prior to the
earlier of (i) 45 days after written notice by Titanium to Silver informing
Silver of such breach or failure to be true and (ii) the End Date; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that Titanium may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ if any of the Titanium Parties is then in
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of any of the Titanium
Parties has become untrue, in each case, such that, if such breach or failure
to be true occurs or continues on the Closing Date, the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_ , as the case may be, would not be
satisfied as of the Closing Date;

  



  

(d) by Titanium prior to receipt of the Titanium Shareholder Approval,

representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement (other than

that, if such breach or failure to be true occurs or continues on the Closing
Date, the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_ , as
the case may be, would not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Silver may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.01(e)_ unless any such breach or failure to be true (x) is not
capable of being cured in a manner sufficient to allow satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_ prior to the
End Date or (y) has not been cured within prior to the earlier of (i) 45 days

untrue, in each case, such that, if such breach or failure to be true occurs
or continues on the Closing Date, the conditions set forth in _Section

liability or obligation on the part of any Titanium Party or any Silver

indemnification obligations of Silver pursuant to _Section 6.05(b)_ , this
_Section 8.02_ , _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which provisions shall
survive such termination, _provided_ , _however_ , that, no such termination
shall relieve any Party from any liability or damages arising out of its
fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  



  

(a) Except as specifically provided for herein, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the Party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are
consummated.

  



  

(b) Titanium OP shall pay to Silver the Termination Fee if:

  



  

(i) Titanium terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_
or Silver terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ ; or

  



  

(ii) (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Titanium and
not withdrawn or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of
Titanium generally and not withdrawn; (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ , _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ or
_Section 8.01(e)_ (with respect to a breach of any covenant, agreement or
other obligation of the Titanium Parties set forth in _Article I_ , _Article
II_ , _Article V_ or _Article VI_ of this Agreement) and (C) within 12 months
of such termination such Acquisition Transaction is consummated by Titanium or
Titanium enters into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition
Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is thereafter consummated by
Titanium, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.03(b)(ii)_ , the references to 15% in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

  



  

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement
in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_ (or prior to or
substantially concurrently with such termination, in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ ) and (y) in the case of clause
(ii) above, on the date of consummation of the Acquisition
Transaction referred to in clause (ii)(C) above.

  



  

(c) Titanium acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
_Section 8.03(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, Silver would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
Titanium fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ ,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Silver commences an Action that
results in a judgment in its favor for such payment, Titanium shall pay to
Silver its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of such
payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins accruing. In no event
shall Titanium be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that Titanium OP is obligated to pay Silver the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ , Titanium OP shall pay to Silver from the
Termination Fee an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Termination Fee (the
" _Applicable Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can
be paid to Silver without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ ") for such
year determined as if (A) the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income, and (B) Silver has 0.5% of its gross income from unknown
sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to
any known or anticipated income of Silver which was not Qualifying Income),
in each case as determined by independent accountants to Silver.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Silver receives Tax Guidance
providing that Silver's receipt of the Applicable Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of the REIT Requirements, the amount of the Termination Fee payable
by Titanium OP to Silver shall be an amount equal to the Applicable Base
Amount and Titanium OP shall, upon receiving notice that Silver has received
the Tax Guidance, pay to Silver the unpaid Applicable Base Amount within five
Business Days. In the event that Silver is not able to receive the full
Applicable Base Amount due to the above limitations, Titanium OP shall place
the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three Business Days of
termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Silver unless and
until Silver receives either one or a combination of the following once or
more often: (x) a letter from Silver's independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Silver without causing Silver
to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (y)
the Tax Guidance, in either of which events Titanium OP shall pay to Silver
the lesser of the unpaid Applicable Base Amount or the maximum amount stated
in the letter referred to in clause (x) above within five Business Days after
Titanium OP has been notified thereof. Any portion of the Termination Fee
that remains unpaid as of December 31 following the date which is three years
from the date of this Agreement shall be released from escrow and revert to
Titanium OP. Titanium and Titanium OP shall not bear any cost of or have any
liability resulting from any escrow arrangement established pursuant to this
_Section 8.03(d)_ , and Silver shall fully indemnify Titanium and Titanium OP
and hold Titanium and Titanium OP harmless from and against any such cost or
liability. For purposes herein, " _Qualifying Income_ " shall mean income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code, and "
_Tax Guidance_ " shall mean a reasoned opinion from outside counsel or a
ruling from the IRS.

  



  

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
Parties at any time before or after receipt of the Titanium Shareholder
Approval or the Titanium OP Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after
receipt of the Titanium Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no
amendment that by Applicable Law requires further approval by the shareholders
of Titanium without the further approval of such shareholders, and (ii) after
receipt of Titanium OP Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by
Applicable Law requires further approval by the unitholders of Titanium OP
without the further approval of such unitholders. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in
any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with
any covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

  



  

Section 8.06 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or
Waiver_. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , an
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.04_ or an extension or
waiver pursuant to _Section 8.05_ shall, in order to be effective, require,
in the case of Titanium or Silver, action by its Board of Directors (in the
case of Titanium, acting on the recommendation of the Titanium Special
Committee) or a duly authorized committee thereof (including, in the case of
Titanium, the Titanium Special Committee). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) any amendment or modification of
this Agreement (including any amendment or modification to any exhibit or
schedule referred to in this Agreement), (b) any extension or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement by any of the Titanium Parties and (c)
any consent or approval to be given or made by any of the Titanium Parties
under or relating to this Agreement shall, in each such case, require the
written consent of the Titanium Family Representative, and no Titanium Party
shall take any such action without obtaining such written consent of the
Titanium Family Representative (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that the
Titanium Family Representative shall have no right to consent to any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ ). The Person listed
on _Section 8.06_ of the Titanium Disclosure Letter (the " _Titanium
Family Representative_ ") has been designated as a representative of the
Titanium Family in connection with the matters contemplated hereby, is an
express third party beneficiary of this Agreement and the Parties shall be
entitled to rely upon the written consent of the Titanium Family
Representative for all purposes hereunder.

Section 9.03 _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means an agreement with Titanium
that is either (i) in effect as of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement; or (ii) executed, delivered and effective after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, in either case containing provisions that require
any counterparty thereto (and any of its Affiliates and representatives named
therein) that receive material non-public information of, or with respect to,
Titanium to keep such information confidential that, in each case, contains
confidentiality and use provisions that are no less restrictive to such
counterparty (and any of its Affiliates and representatives as provided
therein) than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
Applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as
either the economic or legal substance of the Transactions, is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights
under this _Section 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible
in an acceptable manner so that the Transactions are fulfilled to the
greatest extent possible.

more counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments,

Section 9.08 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. 

  



  

(a)  This Agreement and all claims, actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, any of the Transactions, or the actions of the
Silver Parties or the Titanium Parties in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement hereof and thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan (without
giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

  



  

(b)  Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to submit
itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the
State of Michigan (such courts, collectively, the " _Michigan Courts_ ") in
the event any dispute, claim or cause of action arises out of or relates to
this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any Michigan Court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
claim or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in any court other than a Michigan Court. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 9.02_. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Applicable Law.

  



  

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ANY
REPRESENTATIVE OF SILVER OR TITANIUM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.08_.

  



  

Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. No assignment by any Party
shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 9.09_ shall be null and void.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the
right of a Party to cause the other Parties to consummate the Transactions. It
is agreed that the Parties are entitled to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of
actual damages (and each such Party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

Holders shall be adjusted simultaneously to reflect the aggregate net

Code or applicable Regulations. If there are any changes after the date
of this Agreement in applicable tax law or regulations, or any errors,
ambiguities, inconsistencies or omissions in this Agreement with respect to
allocations to be made to Capital Accounts which would, individually or in the
aggregate, cause the Members or Preferred Holders not to achieve in any
material respect the economic objectives underlying this Agreement, the
Partnership Representative may make, in its reasonable discretion,
appropriate adjustments to such allocations in order to achieve or approximate
such economic objectives; _provided_ , that the Partnership Representative
shall provide advanced written notice to all the Members and
Preferred Holders, in sufficient detail to enable such Members and Preferred
Holders to evaluate the issue and the Partnership Representative's proposed
adjustments, and shall consider in good faith any comments received from the
Members and Preferred Holders that would be adversely affected by the
Partnership Representative's proposed adjustment prior to making any
adjustments to such allocations. In the event that the Partnership
Representative reasonably determines that the manner in which the Capital
Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are maintained or computed under
the Regulations should be further amended, the Partnership
Representative shall be authorized to amend this Agreement; _provided_ that
such amendment shall not adversely affect any Member or Preferred Holder or
the Membership Interest of a Member or Preferred Holder, including the right
to receive distributions allocable thereto, without the prior written consent
of such Member or Preferred Holder. In determining whether this Agreement
should be amended to reflect the foregoing, the Partnership Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of the Company Accountants and
counsel to the Company.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(b)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the term "
_Book Value_ " or " _Book Values_ " means, with respect to any asset, such
asset's adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, except:

  



  

(i)  the initial Book Value of any asset contributed by a

required by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(f)_ ): (i) the
acquisition from the Company, in exchange for more than a _de minimis_ capital
contribution, of a Membership Interest by an additional member or an
additional Membership Interest by an existing Member or Preferred Holder; (ii)
the distribution by the Company to a Member or Preferred Holder of more than
a _de minimis_ amount of Company property (including money) as consideration
for an interest in the Company; (iii) the issuance of any interests in the
Company as consideration for the provision of services to or for the benefit
of the Company; and (iv) the liquidation of the Company within the meaning of
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) _(g)_ ;

  



  

(iii)  if the Book Value of an asset has been determined or
adjusted as provided in Section 4.5(b)(i) or Section 4.5(b)(ii), the Book
Value of such asset shall thereafter be adjusted by the Depreciation taken
into account with respect to such asset for purposes of computing Profits and
Losses; and

  



  

(iv)  the Book Value of any Company asset distributed to any
Member or Preferred Holder shall be the gross fair market value of such asset
on the date of distribution.

  



  

(c)  In the event that subsequent to the Effective Date any
provision of this Article IV requires the determination of the fair market
value of any asset, such fair market value shall be as determined by
Partnership Representative and the relevant Member or Preferred Holder;
_provided_ that (i) such value is reasonably agreed to by such Persons in
arm's length negotiations and (ii) such Persons have sufficiently adverse
interests, as provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(h)_. In the
event that the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 4.5(c) are
not met, then the fair market value shall be determined using the procedures
set forth in Exhibit L for determining Fair Market Value, applied _mutatis
mutandis_. The cost of any such appraisal shall be an expense of the Company.

Interest_ " means, with respect to a Member or Preferred Holder, such
Member's or Preferred Holder's right to the allocations (and each item
thereof) specified in Section 5.1 and distributions from the Company, its
share of expenditures of the Company described in Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the
Code (or treated as such under Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _i_ ))
and its rights of management, consent, approval, or participation, if any, as
provided in this Agreement. Membership Interests shall be represented by and
divided into units (herein referred to collectively as the " _Units of
Membership Interest_ " and individually as a " _Unit of Membership Interest_
") that are either common Units of Membership Interest (the " _Common Units_
") or Preferred Units, each having the relative rights, powers, preferences,
duties, qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth in this
Agreement. The Membership Interest Ledger for Common Units and the Membership
Interest Ledger for Preferred Units as of the date hereof is attached hereto
as Schedule I. The Company may issue additional Units of Membership Interest
in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, including
Section 8.3. All Membership Interests are securities governed by Article 8 of
the Uniform Commercial Code, as provided in Section 8-103(c) of the Uniform
Commercial Code, as in effect from time to time in the State of Delaware.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(b)  For the purpose of this Agreement, the term " _Percentage
Interest_ " means, with respect to each Member, a fraction, the numerator of
which is the aggregate number of Common Units held by such Member, and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of all Common Units that are
issued and outstanding. Each Member's Percentage Interest shall be set forth
opposite such Member's name on the Membership Interest Ledger for Common
Units, as the Membership Interest Ledger for Common Units may be updated from
time to time in accordance with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
for purposes of calculating Percentage Interest, no interest in the Company
that is a Preferred Unit shall be taken into account.

  



  

(c)  The parties hereto agree to the matters set forth on
Exhibit K.

  



   | Section 4.7| Membership Interest Certificates.

Operating Agreement of The Taubman Realty Group LLC, as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time (the " _Operating Agreement_ "), a
copy of which is on file at the office of The Taubman Realty Group LLC. Any
assignment, sale, transfer, conveyance, mortgage, or other encumbrance,
pledge, grant of an option or proxy, or other disposition or act
of alienation, whether voluntary or involuntary, or by operation of law, in
respect of a Unit of Membership Interest made other than as permitted in the
Operating Agreement shall be null and void and have no force or effect
whatsoever."

  



  

Transfers of Units of Membership Interest shall be made only as permitted
herein and, if a Membership Interest Certificate has been issued with respect
to such Membership Interest, then only upon the request of the Person named
in the such Membership Interest Certificate, or by its attorney
lawfully constituted in writing, and upon surrender and cancellation of such
Membership Interest Certificate for a like number of Units of Membership
Interest, a duly executed and acknowledged written instrument of assignment
and agreement by the transferee to be bound by this Agreement, and with such
proof of authenticity of the signatures as the Chief Executive Officer or the
Board of Directors, as applicable, may reasonably require. In the event that
the Company shall purchase any Units of Membership Interest
(including Fractional Units), such Units of Membership Interest (or
Fractional Units) shall be extinguished, and the Membership Interest
Certificates with respect thereto shall be surrendered and cancelled.

and " _Losses_ " mean, respectively, for each Company Fiscal Year or other

stated separately pursuant to Section 703(a)(1) of the Code shall be included
in taxable income or loss), adjusted as follows:

  



  

(i)  any income of the Company that is exempt from federal
income tax and not otherwise taken into account in computing Profits or
Losses pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) shall be added to such taxable income
or loss;

  



  

(ii)  in lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost
recovery deductions taken into account in computing such taxable income or
loss, there shall be taken into account Depreciation for such Company Fiscal
Year or other period; and

  



  

(iii)  any items that are specially allocated pursuant to Section
5.1(d) or Section 5.1(g) shall not be taken into account in computing Profits
or Losses.

  



  

(b)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.1(d) or Section
5.1(g), the Profits and Losses of the Company (and each item thereof) for
each Company Fiscal Year shall be allocated among the Members and Preferred
Holders in accordance with this Section 5.1(b).

  



  

(i)  Profits shall be allocated:

  



  

(A) first, to the Preferred Holders, in an amount equal to the
Unallocated Preferred Return with respect to each series (proportionate as to
such Unallocated Preferred Return among each series); and then

  



  

(B)  second, to the Preferred Holders, in an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the cumulative amount of Losses allocated to such
Preferred Holders pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii)(B) over the cumulative amount
of Profits allocated to such Preferred Holders pursuant to this Section
5.1(b)(i)(B) (proportionate as to such excess amounts); and then

  



  

(C)  third, to the Members in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(ii)  Losses shall be allocated:

  



  

(A)  first, to Members until the Adjusted Capital Account Balances
of all such Members are reduced to zero, excluding, for purposes of
calculating the Adjusted Capital Account Balance of any Preferred Holder, the
Preferred Units (in proportion to such positive Adjusted Capital Account
Balances (excluding the Preferred Units)); and then

  



  

(B)  second, to the Preferred Holders, if any, until the Adjusted
Capital Account Balances of the Preferred Holders are reduced to zero (in
proportion to such positive Adjusted Capital Account Balances); and then

  



  

(C)  third, to the Members in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.

  



  

(c)  For the purpose of Section 5.1(b), gain or loss resulting
from any disposition of Company property shall be computed by reference to
the Book Value of the property disposed of, notwithstanding that the adjusted
tax basis of such property for federal income tax purposes differs from its
Book Value.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.1, the following provisions shall apply:

  



  

(i)  Nonrecourse Deductions shall be allocated in accordance
with the Members Percentage Interests; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Member
shall not receive an allocation of any Company deduction that would result in
total loss allocations attributable to Nonrecourse Liabilities in excess of
such Member's share of Minimum Gain (as determined under Regulations Section
1.704-2(g)). If there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain for a Company
Fiscal Year, in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and the
exceptions contained therein, the Members shall be allocated items of Company
income and gain for such Company Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, for
subsequent Company Fiscal Years) equal to the Members' respective shares of
the net decrease in Minimum Gain within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-2(g)(2). The items to be allocated pursuant to this Section
5.1(d)(i) shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Sections
1.704-2(f) and (j).

  



  

(ii)  Any item of Member Nonrecourse Deduction with respect to a
Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be allocated to the Member or Members (or
Preferred Holder or Preferred Holders) who bear the economic risk of loss for
such Member Nonrecourse Debt in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(1). Subject to Section 5.1(d)(i), but notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, in the event that there is a net decrease in
Minimum Gain attributable to a Member Nonrecourse Debt (such Minimum Gain
being hereinafter referred to as " _Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_ ")
for a Company Fiscal Year, then after taking into account allocations
pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(i), but before any other allocations are made for
such taxable year, and subject to the exceptions set forth in Regulations
Section 1.704-2(i)(4), each Member or Preferred Holder with a share of Member
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such Company Fiscal Year
shall be allocated items of income and gain for such Company Fiscal Year
(and, if necessary, for subsequent Company Fiscal Years) equal to such
Member's or Preferred Holder's share of the net decrease in Member
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain as determined in a manner consistent with the
provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2). The items to be allocated
pursuant to this Section 5.1(d)(ii) shall be determined in accordance with
Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and (j).

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(iii)  For the purpose of determining each Member's or Preferred
Holder's share of excess Nonrecourse Liabilities of the Company, and solely
for such purpose, each Member's or Preferred Holder's interest in Company
profits shall be reasonably determined by the Partnership Representative in
accordance with Internal Revenue Service authority interpreting
Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), and to the extent reasonably possible, the
Partnership Representative will allocate excess Nonrecourse Liabilities first
to each Member and Preferred Holder with negative Capital Accounts up to the
amount of such negative Capital Account set forth with respect to each Member
and Preferred Holder on Schedule IV as of the Effective Date, as reduced
from time to time (i) proportionately to reflect any Transfer of Common Units
by any such Member and Preferred Holder and (ii) to reflect the allocation of
taxable income to each such Member and Preferred Holder in excess of pro rata
distributions to each such Member and Preferred Holder, as applicable;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the allocation of Nonrecourse
Liabilities to Silver OP shall not be less than the amount of Nonrecourse
Liabilities required to be allocated pursuant to the agreement set forth in
Section 2 of Schedule V. Silver OP shall, and Silver Parent shall cause Silver
OP to, allocate to any of its members that are a party to the agreement set
forth in Section 2 of Schedule V an amount of Nonrecourse Liabilities at least
equal to the amount of Nonrecourse Liabilities required to be allocated to
such members pursuant to such agreement provided that at least that amount of
Nonrecourse Liabilities are allocated to Silver OP by the Partnership
Representative and Silver OP is able to make such allocation under applicable
law, as reasonably determined by Silver OP; _provided_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Silver OP shall not be liable for any failure to make any
allocation of Nonrecourse Liabilities to such members as a result of the
failure of the Company to allocate such Nonrecourse Liabilities to Silver OP
or if Silver OP is not able to make such allocation under applicable law, as
reasonably determined by Silver OP, in each case, unless the Partnership
Representative, during the Silver Period, has failed to comply with this
Section 5.1(d)(iii).

  



  

(iv)  No Member or Preferred Holder shall be allocated any item of
deduction or loss of the Company if such allocation would cause such Member's
or Preferred Holder's Capital Account to become negative by more than the sum
of (i) any amount such Member or Preferred Holder is obligated to restore
upon liquidation of the Company, plus (ii) such Member's or Preferred
Holder's share of the Company's Minimum Gain and Member Nonrecourse Debt
Minimum Gain. For this purpose, in determining the Capital Account balance of
such Member or Preferred Holder, the items described in Regulations Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( _d_ ) _(4)_ ,  _(5)_ and _(6)_ shall be taken into
account. In the event that (A) any Member or Preferred Holder unexpectedly
receives any adjustment, allocation, or distribution described in Regulations
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) _(d)(4)_ , _(5)_ or  _(6)_ , and (B) such
adjustment, allocation, or distribution causes or increases a deficit balance
(net of amounts which such Member or Preferred Holder is obligated to restore
or deemed obligated to restore under Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and
1.704-2(i)(5) and determined after taking into account any adjustments,
allocations, or distributions described in Regulations Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( _d_ ) _(4)_ , _(5)_ , or _(6)_ that, as of the end of the
Company Fiscal Year, reasonably are expected to be made to such Member or
such Preferred Holder) in such Member's or Preferred Holder's Capital Account
as of the end of the Company Fiscal Year to which such adjustment, allocation,
or distribution relates, then items of Gross Income (consisting of a _pro
rata_ portion of each item of Gross Income) for such Company Fiscal Year and
each subsequent Company Fiscal Year shall be allocated to such Member or
Preferred Holder until such deficit balance or increase in such
deficit balance, as the case may be, has been eliminated. In the event that
this Section 5.1(d)(iv) and Section 5.1(d)(i) or (ii) apply, Section
5.1(d)(i) or (ii) shall be applied prior to this Section 5.1(d)(iv).

(v)  Such portion of the gain allocated pursuant to this Section
5.1 that is treated as ordinary income attributable to the recapture of
depreciation shall, to the extent reasonably possible, be allocated among the
Members or Preferred Holders in the proportion that (i) the amount of
depreciation previously allocated to each Member or Preferred Holder relating
to the property that is the subject of the disposition bears to (ii) the
total of such depreciation allocated to all of the Members or Preferred
Holders. This Section 5.1(d)(v) shall not alter the amount of allocations
among the Members or Preferred Holders pursuant to this Section 5.1, but
merely the character of gain so allocated.

  



  

(vi)  To the extent permitted by Regulations Sections
1.704-2(h)(3) and 1.704-2(i)(6), the Partnership Representative
shall endeavor to treat a distribution of the proceeds of Nonrecourse
Liabilities (that would otherwise be allocable to an increase in Company
Minimum Gain) or Member Nonrecourse Debt (that would otherwise be allocable to
an increase in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain) as a distribution that
is not allocable to an increase in Company Minimum Gain or Member Nonrecourse
Debt Minimum Gain to the extent that such distribution does not cause or
increase a deficit balance in any Member's or Preferred Holder's Capital
Account that exceeds the amount such Member or Preferred Holder is otherwise
obligated to restore (within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c)) as of the end of the Company's taxable year in which the
distribution occurs.

(vii)  The Company is a partner in each of the Taxable Partnerships.
Each Taxable Partnership has elected or shall elect the "alternative base
method" provided under the Pass-Through Entity Tax for calculating each
Subject Member's Pass-Through Entity Tax liability (the " _Alternative Base
Method_ "). The partnership agreement or operating agreement governing each
Taxable Partnership specially allocates the federal income tax deduction for
the Pass-Through Entity Tax to the Subject Members in such Taxable
Partnerships in proportion to each such Subject Member's allocable share (the
" _State Allocable Share_ ") of such tax, determined in accordance with the
ratio that each Subject Member's share of the income of such Taxable
Partnership (before deduction of the Pass-Through Entity Tax) subject to the
Pass-Through Entity Tax (computed under the Alternative Base Method) bears to
the aggregate income of such Taxable Partnership (before deduction of the
Pass-Through Entity Tax) subject to the Pass-Through Entity Tax (computed
under the Alternative Base Method) of all the Subject Members of such Taxable
Partnership (the " _Special Allocation Formula_ "). The Members and Preferred
Holders hereby acknowledge and agree that the federal income tax
deduction for the payment of the Pass-Through Entity Tax liability shall be
allocated to each of the Subject Members of the Company in accordance with
their State Allocable Shares determined in accordance with the Special
Allocation Formula. The partnership agreement or operating agreement
governing each Taxable Partnership allocates the corresponding Connecticut
personal income tax credit for payment of the Pass-Through Entity Tax to its
Subject Members in accordance with the Special Allocation Formula. The Members
and Preferred Holders hereby acknowledge and agree that the Connecticut
personal income tax credit shall be allocated to the Subject Members in the
Company in accordance with the Special Allocation Formula. To the extent a
Member or Preferred Holder (or any direct or indirect member of a Member or
Preferred Holder) is not subject to the Pass-Through Entity Tax on its share
of the Company's income subject to such tax, then such Member or Preferred
Holder shall provide the Company with written notice thereof within
thirty (30) Days prior to the due date for payment by the Company of the
Pass-Through Entity Tax. The Company shall give each Subject Member written
notice setting forth such Subject Member's State Allocable Share of the Pass-
Through Entity Tax. The Company shall (i) withhold from cash otherwise
currently distributable to each Subject Member pursuant to Section 5.2 or
Section 10.5(a), as applicable, such Subject Member's State Allocable Share
of the Pass-Through Entity Tax, (ii) decrease each Subject Member's Capital
Account by such Subject Member's State Allocable Share of the Pass-Through
Entity Tax and (iii) to the extent cash is not distributable to such Subject
Member for the taxable quarter (or if the tax is not payable quarterly,
then for such other taxable period during which the tax must be paid) in
which the Pass-Through Entity Tax must be paid by the Company, each Subject
Member shall make a payment to the Company in readily available funds within
ten (10) Days after written notice from the Company of such Subject Member's
amount due. In the event a Subject Member fails to timely remit its State
Allocable Share of the Pass-Through Entity Tax, the Partnership
Representative may determine, in its sole discretion, either to (x)
treat, subject to any required consent under any applicable financing, such
Subject Member's State Allocable Share of the Pass-Through Entity Tax as a
loan from the Company (or from an Affiliate of the Company) (hereinafter,
together with any loan made pursuant to Section 6.26(f) or Article IX,
referred to as a " _Tax Loan_ ") to such Subject Member, which Tax Loan shall
have a maturity of one (1) year, shall bear interest at the Interest Rate, and
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 6.27, and all cash subsequently
distributable to such Subject Member shall, to the extent of the unpaid
principal amount of and the accrued interest on such Tax Loan, be retained by
the Company and applied against the principal and accrued interest on such Tax
Loan, or (y) pursue any and all remedies available to the Company at law or
in equity, including instituting a lawsuit against such Subject Member to
collect such Subject Member's State Allocable Share with interest calculated
at the Interest Rate (the  " _Failure to Comply Remedies_ "). The Members and
Preferred Holders acknowledge that in the event the Company is or becomes a
partner or a member in any other pass-through entity that is or becomes
subject to taxation under a state law providing tax benefits to the direct or
indirect members of such entity, then the provisions of this Section
5.1(d)(vii) shall apply with respect to such entity and such tax. For the
purpose of determining a Subject Member's Capital Account in the Company, any
amount distributable to a Subject Member that is retained by the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.1(d)(vii) shall be treated as if such cash had
been actually distributed to such Member pursuant to Section 5.2 or Section
10.4(a), as applicable, and remitted to the Company by the Subject Member.
The amount deemed remitted or any amount actually remitted to the Company
for payment of the Pass-Through Entity Tax by the Subject Member (not
including any payments of principal and interest on a Tax Loan) and the
principal amount (at the time loaned) of any Tax Loan made by the Company (or
its Affiliate) to the Subject Member pursuant to this Section 5.1(d)(vii)
shall constitute a capital contribution and increase such Subject Member's
Capital Account in the Company; and, in any event, all such amounts shall be
remitted to the Company by the applicable Subject Member prior to the
exercise of such Subject Member's Exchange rights pursuant to Section 8.4, if
applicable. The provisions of this Section 5.1(d)(vii) shall survive a
Subject Member's membership in the Company and the dissolution, liquidation,
winding up, and termination of the Company, and for purposes of this Section
5.1(d)(vii), the Company shall be treated as continuing in existence.
The Company may pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may have
against a Subject Member under this Section 5.1(d)(vii), including
instituting a lawsuit to collect such reimbursement with interest calculated
at the Interest Rate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
provisions of this Section 5.1(d)(vii) shall be binding on the Company's
successors and assigns. To the extent applicable, this Section 5.1(d)(vii)
shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any Subsidiaries of the Company.

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.1, the allocation of Profits and Losses for any Company Fiscal Year
during which a Person acquires a Membership Interest (other than upon
formation of the Company) shall take into account the Members' and Preferred
Holders' varying interests for such Company Fiscal Year pursuant to any
method permissible under Section 706 of the Code that is selected by the
Partnership Representative (notwithstanding any agreement between the
assignor and assignee of such Membership Interest although the Partnership
Representative may recognize any such agreement), which method may take into
account the date on which the Transfer or an agreement to Transfer becomes
irrevocable pursuant to its terms, as determined by the Partnership
Representative.

  



  

(f)  The Profits, Losses, gains, deductions, and credits of the
Company (and all items thereof) for each Company Fiscal Year shall be
determined in accordance with the accounting method followed by the Company
for federal income tax purposes.

  



  

(g)  The following allocations shall be made solely for federal
income tax purposes:

  



  

(i)  The Company shall elect pursuant to Section 754 of the
Code, in connection with the transactions effected pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, to adjust the basis of partnership property. Except as provided in
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(m)_ , such adjustment shall not be
reflected in the Members' Capital Accounts and shall be effective solely for
federal and (if applicable) state and local income tax purposes. Each Member
and Preferred Holder hereby agrees to provide the Company with
all information necessary to give effect to such election. With respect to
such election:

  



  

(i)  Any change in the amount of the depreciation deducted by
the Company and any change in the gain or loss of the Company, for federal
income tax purposes, resulting from an adjustment pursuant to Section 743(b)
of the Code shall be allocated entirely to the transferee of the Membership
Interest or portion thereof so transferred. Neither the capital contribution
obligations of, nor the Membership Interest of, nor the amount of any cash
distributions to, the Members or Preferred Holders shall be affected as a
result of such election, and except as provided in Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(m)_ , the making of such election shall have no effect,
except for federal and (if applicable) state and local income tax purposes.

  



  

   

33

 



    



  

(ii)  Solely for federal and (if applicable) state and local
income tax purposes and not for the purpose of maintaining the Members' and
Preferred Holders' Capital Accounts (except as provided in Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(m)_ ), the Company shall keep a written record for those
assets, the basis of which is adjusted as a result of such election, and the
amount at which such assets are carried on such record shall be debited (in
the case of an increase in basis) or credited (in the case of a decrease in
basis) by the amount of such basis adjustment. Any change in the amount of the
depreciation deducted by the Company and any change in the gain or loss of
the Company, for federal and (if applicable) state and local income tax
purposes, attributable to the basis adjustment made as a result of such
election shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, on such record.

  



  

(ii)  In accordance with Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code
and the Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with
respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Company shall,
solely for federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the Members and
Preferred Holders so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted
basis of such property to the Company for federal income tax purposes and the
initial Book Value of such property. If the Book Value of any Company
property is adjusted pursuant to Section 4.5(b), subsequent allocations of
income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to such asset shall take
account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal
income tax purposes and the Book Value of such asset in the manner prescribed
under Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder.
With respect to any Section 704(c) allocations arising out of or attributable
to any transactions after the Effective Date (including with respect to any
reverse Section 704(c) amounts caused by any book-up in capital accounts),
such allocations shall be made using the traditional method specified in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that Section
704(c) allocations with respect to the properties which are the subject of
the agreements set forth on Schedule V shall be made using the
traditional method with curative allocations specified in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-3(c).

  



  

(h)  Except as provided in Sections 5.1(g)(i) and 5.1(g)(ii),
for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss, or
deduction shall be allocated among the Members and Preferred Holders in the
same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss, or
deduction has been allocated pursuant to this Section 5.1.

   | Section 5.2| Distributions. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  No later than December 15 prior to the beginning of each
Company Fiscal Year, the Chief Executive Officer shall present to the Board
of Directors for approval an annual distribution policy (an " _Annual
Distribution Policy_ ") for such upcoming Fiscal Year; _provided_ , that such
annual distribution policy shall provide for the distribution of no less
than the Required Distribution Amount. In determining and approving the
Annual Distribution Policy, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of
Directors shall consider the Estimated Minimum Distribution Amount for the
upcoming Fiscal Year and the Minimum Distribution Amount, if any, remaining
to be distributed with respect to the then-current Fiscal Year. Between
October and mid-December of each Fiscal Year beginning in 2022, as part of
the Annual Budget approval process, the Company will provide the Board of
Directors with a draft Annual Distribution Policy for the next Fiscal Year
(with the initial draft of such policy to be provided by October 31 of the
then-current Fiscal Year). In the event that an Annual Distribution Policy for
any such upcoming Company Fiscal Year (i.e., 2023 and thereafter) is not
unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, the Annual Distribution Policy
for such Company Fiscal Year shall provide for mandatory minimum
distributions equal to the greater of (x) the Minimum Distribution Amount and
(y) 65% of the budgeted aggregate "funds from operations" for the Company and
its Subsidiaries set forth in the applicable Annual Budget for such Company
Fiscal Year, subject to quarterly adjustment to give effect to any change to
the "outlook" for the Company Fiscal Year (i.e., good faith projections of
actual performance against the Annual Budget) for actual "funds from
operations", and also taking into account actual performance to date in such
Company Fiscal Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Annual Distribution Policy for each of the
2020, 2021 and 2022 Company Fiscal Years shall be to distribute to Members in
respect of their Common Units at least the Initial Mandatory Minimum per
Common Unit per Company Fiscal Year (subject to pro rata adjustment for
partial years) in accordance with Section 5.2(b), and in no event less than
the Minimum Distribution Amount for any such Company Fiscal Year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, all distributions in excess of the Minimum Distribution Amount shall
be limited by the Company to the extent reasonably necessary to retain cash
to address exigent circumstances, where the failure to retain such
cash, after taking into account the availability of funds from borrowing that
would be available at such time on commercially reasonable terms (and in any
event not at a rate higher than the lower of (x) four hundred basis points
above the 10-year U.S. Treasury bill rate at the time of such borrowing and
(y) 8.00%), would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (" _Distribution
Limitation Event_ "). If the Silver Member believes in good faith that a
Distribution Limitation Event has occurred but the Company has not limited
distributions accordingly, the Silver Member shall be permitted to submit
such disagreement to a Qualified Expert for resolution in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 6.22(b), applied _mutatis mutandis_ ;
_provided_ that distributions for any Company Fiscal Year shall be suspended
during the pendency of any dispute that is subject to resolution pursuant to
Section 6.22(b) but only with respect to any disputed amount (i.e.,
undisputed amounts shall not be suspended) and in any case there shall be no
delay in distributions with respect to any Estimated Minimum Distribution
Amount or Minimum Distribution Amount. Subject to the foregoing, in the
event that the Estimated Minimum Distribution Amount is determined to be
higher or lower than such amount as determined when the Annual Distribution
Policy was set (whether pursuant to changed results, asset sales or
otherwise), the Annual Distribution Policy shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such change.

  



  

   

35

 



    



  

(b)  Subject to Section 5.2(a), except with respect to the
liquidation of the Company or on liquidation of substantially all of the
assets of the Company, which shall be governed by Section 10.5 and subject to
the priority set forth in any Preferred Unit Designation, for the term of the
Company, a cash distribution shall be made to the Members in respect of their
Common Units, in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, not
later than the fifteenth (15) Day of each month (the " _Distribution Date_ ")
of each Company Fiscal Year, in an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the
Required Distribution Amount for such Company Fiscal Year.

  



  

(c)  In the event that the Board of Directors or the Chief
Executive Officer determines that the amount of cash actually distributed to
Members with respect to a Company Fiscal Year pursuant to Section 5.2(b) was
less than the Minimum Distribution Amount for such Company Fiscal Year, then
a cash distribution shall be made to the Members, in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests, as soon as practical, but not later than
ninety (90) Days following the end of such Company Fiscal Year, in an amount
equal to the excess of (1) the Minimum Distribution Amount for such Company
Fiscal Year over (2) the amount of cash actually distributed to Members with
respect to such Company Fiscal Year pursuant to Section 5.2(b).

  



  

(d)  All distributions pursuant to this Section 5.2 and Section
10.5 shall be made in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to the Members (or former Members as provided in the second
following sentence) who are such on the applicable Distribution Date. In no
event may a Member receive a distribution with respect to a Common Unit that
such Member has Exchanged (i.e., the closing of the Exchange with respect to
such Unit has occurred) prior to the relevant Distribution Date, other than
as set forth in the next sentence. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, on the Distribution Date immediately following the closing
of any Exchange, the relevant Exchanging Members (whether or not still a
Member) shall be entitled to receive a prorated distribution with respect to
each Common Unit previously Exchanged in such Exchange based on the number of
days that have elapsed from the preceding Distribution Date until, and
including, the Exchange Date, and the amount to be distributed to Silver OP
(or Silver Parent or another Subsidiary of Silver Parent) with respect to a
Common Unit that has been issued pursuant to Section 8.4 in respect of such
Exchanged Common Unit at the next regularly scheduled Distribution Date shall
be correspondingly reduced. Distributions to the Members under this Agreement
shall be subject to any restriction imposed by applicable law, and
the Company shall refrain from making any distribution hereunder without
liability to the extent such distribution would be in violation of any
applicable law.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall not make or pay any distributions with respect
to any class or series of Preferred Units, except for distributions in
accordance with the applicable Preferred Unit Designation relating to such
class or series of Preferred Units. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i) any Member that receives a distribution in
violation of any Preferred Unit Designation (including any preference on
distributions contained in any Preferred Unit Designation) shall be obligated
to return such distribution to the Company upon delivery of notice to such
Member of such violation and (ii) any amounts that a Member does not return as
and when required by the foregoing clause (i) shall reduce, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis and without duplication, any future distributions to such Member
under this Section 5.2 and any amounts to which such Member would otherwise
be entitled in connection with any Exchange.

   Section 5.3| Bank Accounts and Other Investments. 
---|--- 
  



  

Funds of the Company shall be deposited in one (1) or more bank accounts in
Responsible Financial Institutions, all as determined in good faith by
the Chief Executive Officer during the Titanium Period or the Board of
Directors during the Silver Period. All withdrawals therefrom shall be made
upon the signature or signatures of whichever officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as shall be designated in writing from
time to time by the Chief Executive Officer during the Titanium Period or the
Board of Directors during the Silver Period. Any checks of the Company may be
signed by any officer(s) of the Company designated in writing, from time to
time, by the Chief Executive Officer during the Titanium Period or the Board
of Directors during the Silver Period. In addition, funds of the Company may
be invested in highly liquid investments pursuant to a customary investment
policy approved from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer during the
Titanium Period or the Board of Directors during the Silver Period. Funds of
the Company shall not be commingled with the funds of any other Person (other
than Subsidiaries of the Company).

  



   Section 5.4| Books of Account. 
---|--- 
  



  

The Company shall maintain at its principal office complete and accurate
books of account and records of its operations showing the assets,
liabilities, costs, expenditures, receipts, profits, and losses of the
Company, and which books of account and records shall include provision
for separate Capital Accounts for the Members and Preferred Holders and shall
provide for such other matters and information as may be required by the Act
or as the Chief Executive Officer during the Titanium Period or the Board of
Directors during the Silver Period shall otherwise determine, together with
copies of all documents executed on behalf of the Company. In addition, the
Company shall maintain at its principal office a Membership Interest Ledger
for Common Units and a Membership Interest Ledger for Preferred Units, which
shall be kept current by the Company. Each Member and its representatives,
duly authorized in writing, shall have the right to inspect and examine, at
all reasonable times, at the principal office of the Company, all such books
of account, records, ledgers, and documents.

  



   Section 5.5| Tax Returns. 
---|--- 
  



  

(a)  The Partnership Representative shall determine the methods to
be used in the preparation of federal, state, and local income and other tax
returns for the Company in connection with all items of income and expense,
including, but not limited to, valuation of assets, the methods of
depreciation and cost recovery, elections, credits, and tax accounting methods
and procedures.

  



  

(b)  As soon as practicable, but in any event within one hundred
twenty (120) Days after the end of each Company Fiscal Year, the Company
shall cause to be prepared and transmitted to the Members federal income tax
IRS Form Schedule K-1s, or any substitute therefor, with respect to such
Company Fiscal Year. As soon as practicable, but in any event within one
hundred fifty (150) Days after the end of each Company Fiscal Year, the
Company shall cause to be prepared and transmitted to the Members appropriate
state and local income tax Schedule K-1s, or any substitute therefor, with
respect to such Company Fiscal Year on appropriate forms prescribed. In
addition, the Company shall provide to the Silver Member, on a quarterly
basis, a report regarding the income projections of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any other information reasonably requested by the Silver
Member in order for Silver Parent to comply with its reporting requirements
as a Real Estate Investment Trust.

As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within forty-five (45)
Days after the end of each Company Fiscal Year, the Company shall cause to be
prepared and transmitted to each Member, an unaudited annual report of the
Company relating to the previous Company Fiscal Year, containing a statement
of financial condition as of the year then ended, and statements of
operations, cash flow and Company equity for the year then ended, which
annual statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within seventy-five (75) Days after
the end of each Company Fiscal Year, the Company shall cause to be prepared

that is a quarter or year-end), unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the end of that month, and unaudited
consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for that month, prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company

practicable (and the Company shall provide such items on a time frame
sufficient for the Company to comply with its obligations under Silver
Parent's bona fide internal policies, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the applicable stock exchange rules, and under any other regulations to which
Silver Parent or the Company may be subject, in each case as to

will permit Silver Parent to comply with such obligations or make such
determinations in a timely fashion, (iii) such reports or information
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of their respective
lenders (which shall be provided to Silver Parent promptly following their
provisions to such lenders), (iv) such reports or information to which the
Board of Directors or a member of the Board of Directors would be entitled if
the Company were a Delaware corporation and (v) any other reports or
information in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that

this Section 5.6 in connection with any approval required or requested of the
Board of Directors, in connection with the determination of the Total Equity
Value pursuant Exhibit L or in connection with a Deadlock pursuant to Section
6.22, any time period required for such approval or determination shall be

foregoing, including clause (ii) above, (a) within twenty (20) Days after the
end of each calendar quarter, the Company shall provide to the Silver Member
(x) written confirmation that the Company has conducted a review of the

Annual Budget as presented, then such Annual Budget shall be deemed to be
adopted and approved as an Annual Budget for the applicable Company Fiscal
Year. If any such proposed Annual Budget is not approved (or is deemed
disapproved) by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer shall

Budget: (i) any increases in expenses with respect to Non-Controllable Items
and (ii) percentage increases or decreases to each item therein other than any
Non-Controllable Items in an amount equal to the annual percentage increase
or decrease, respectively, in the CPI; _provided_ that in no event shall any
percentage increase pursuant to this clause (ii) be greater than the greater
of (I) 2.5% and (II) the percentage increase in the Company LTM FFO (measured
by comparing the Company LTM FFO as of December 31 immediately prior to the
Company Fiscal Year to which the to-be-adopted Annual Budget relates to the
Company LTM FFO as of one year prior to such date); _provided_ , _further_
, that non-ordinary course expenditures that have not yet been committed
pursuant to a prior year's Annual Budget ( _e.g._ , a new development to be
initiated in the upcoming Company Fiscal Year or the acquisition of a new
property in the upcoming Company Fiscal Year), and tenant improvements,
tenant allowances, landlord work and other tenant inducement costs and similar
expenses that have not yet been committed pursuant to a prior year's Annual
Budget, and that either (x) are with respect to any lease covering more than
twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of gross leasable area or (y) involve
more than two million Dollars ($2,000,000) for any lease, will not be deemed
adopted and approved (however, and for the avoidance of doubt,
ordinary course expenditures for property-level repairs and maintenance, to
continue projects to the extent previously approved in a prior year's Annual
Budget and other tenant improvements, tenant allowances, landlord work and

(c)  The Chief Executive Officer shall have the right, from time
to time during each Company Fiscal Year, to submit a proposed amendment to an

distributions made by the Company in accordance with Section 5.2 shall not be
limited by this Section 6.16(d), and the amount by which any such
expenditure or distribution exceeds the amount therefor set forth in the
Annual Budgets shall not be counted in determining whether a variance or
deviation has occurred and (Y) expenditures made from any contingency or
unspecified line item in the Annual Capital Budget available therefor shall
not be counted in determining whether a variance or deviation has occurred.

contrary, neither the Chief Executive Officer nor the Company (I) shall have
any obligation to meet or exceed any performance variables, thresholds, goals
or results that may be set forth in any Annual Budget or (II) is making, or
shall be deemed to have made, any guaranty, representation or warranty of the
estimations set forth in any Annual Budget or with respect to the results or
quality of performance of any actions that may be contemplated by any

For so long as the Titanium Family Group (together with any Family
Transferees) continues to own, collectively, at least twenty-five percent
(25%) of the Membership Interests owned by the Titanium Family Group as of the
Effective Date (subject to any adjustment necessary to account for any split,
dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification or similar event, in
each case, in respect of the Membership Interests), unless previously offered
to the Company on commercially reasonable terms (which offer must include an
affirmative consent of each Silver Director for the Company to accept such
offer and for the Company to take any commercially reasonable action to
consummate any such transaction), Silver Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) not to, acquire or

obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any interests
(including any debt or equity securities) of any joint venture, partnership,

the forgoing transactions for any reason, Silver Parent shall work in good
faith with the Company and the Titanium Family Designee to (a) protect the
interests of the Company and all of the Members and (b) not take any action

restrictions in this Section 6.21 shall not apply to Silver Parent and its
Subsidiaries in connection with, or during the pendency of, a Bankruptcy or
involuntary bankruptcy in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the
aggregate, generate at least one-third (1/3) of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' net operating income that is either not contested in good faith
by the Company or is not dismissed within one hundred and eighty (180) Days of
the applicable filing.

   | Section 6.22| Deadlocks. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  Subject to Section 6.22(c), from and after January 1, 2021,
if a Fundamental Decision Approval is not obtained pursuant to Section 6.19
(or Section 6.15) or a Titanium Family Approval is not obtained pursuant to
Section 6.20(a), in each case within twenty-one (21) Days after submission of
such matter to the Board of Directors or the Titanium Family Designee, as
applicable, then either the Silver Member or the Titanium Family Designee can
send written notice thereof to the other (a " _Deadlock Notice_ "), stating
that failure to reach agreement on such matter within twenty-one (21) Days
after delivery of the Deadlock Notice will give rise to a deadlock with
respect thereto (a " _Deadlock_ "); _provided_ , that the Silver Member may
not deliver more than two Deadlock Notices in any twelve (12) month period and
the Titanium Family Designee may not deliver more than two Deadlock Notices
in any twelve (12) month period. As promptly as practicable following the
giving of a Deadlock Notice, the chief executive officer of Silver Parent and
the Chief Executive Officer (and, at the election of the Titanium Family
Designee, a representative of the Titanium Family Group) shall meet to
negotiate in good faith in order to try to resolve the deadlock
or disagreement over the disputed matter or matters (it being understood that
a refusal to meet or negotiate on the part of any Person shall not preclude a
Deadlock from occurring). If the representatives pursuant to the preceding
sentence are unable to reach agreement on the disputed matter prior to the
occurrence of a Deadlock as set forth in this Section 6.22(a), then the
Company shall submit such Deadlock, and either the Silver Member or the
Titanium Family Designee may cause such Deadlock to be submitted, to binding
arbitration before a Qualified Expert under the rules of the American
Arbitration Association that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(or, in the event that the American Arbitration Association will not proceed
on that basis, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association then
in effect) (the " _Rules_ ") and the procedures set forth in Section 6.22(b)
shall be followed. The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York. A
judgment on the award or decision rendered by the Qualified Expert may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

  



  

(b)  The Rules for "Expedited Procedures" shall apply to a
Deadlock only if and to the extent the Silver Member elects in its sole
discretion. In the event that the Silver Member or the Titanium Family
Designee calls for a determination of a Deadlock in arbitration pursuant to
the terms of this Section 6.22, Silver Parent and the Titanium Family Designee
shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days from the date of such request
to mutually agree on one Qualified Expert. If Silver Parent and the Titanium
Family Designee fail to so agree, each of Silver Parent and the Titanium
Family Designee shall have an additional ten (10) Business Days to each
select a Qualified Expert, and the two Qualified Experts selected shall
select, and Silver Parent and the Titanium Family Designee shall request its
selected Qualified Expert to select, a single Qualified Expert to be the
arbitrator for the Deadlock in question. If either the Silver Member or the
Titanium Family Designee fails to make its respective selection of a
Qualified Expert within the additional ten (10) Day period provided for above,
then the other party's selection shall be the Qualified Expert to be the
arbitrator for the Deadlock in question. If the selected Qualified Experts
fail to select a single Qualified Expert within ten (10) Business Days of the
selection of the last of them, the Silver Member, the Titanium Family
Designee and the Company agree that the Qualified Expert shall be selected by
the American Arbitration Association from its panel of arbitrators who reside
in New York, New York. The Qualified Expert shall decide the issue submitted
to him/her in accordance with and giving equal effect to (i) the language,
commercial purpose and restrictions contained in this Agreement and (ii) that
which the Qualified Expert reasonably believes, in good faith and using the
care that a reasonably prudent person would use, is in the best interests of
the Company, recognizing and taking into account the commercial purposes of
this Agreement and the arrangement between the Members and their Affiliates,
including the equity investments in the Company by the Silver Member (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the consideration paid by the
Silver Member and its Affiliates in connection with the Merger) and the
Titanium Family Group and the business of Silver Parent and of the Company as
each has been historically conducted. Because a prolonged Deadlock may have a
serious adverse effect on the Company, the Silver Member and the Titanium
Family Designee shall instruct the Qualified Expert to render a decision as
quickly as reasonably possible. The Qualified Expert shall decide the
dispute based solely on the submissions and evidence provided by the Silver
Member and the Titanium Family Designee. The Qualified Expert may, in his or
her discretion, upon good cause shown and consistent with the expedited nature
of arbitration, order depositions to obtain the testimony of a person or
entity that may possess information determined by the Qualified Expert to be
relevant and material to the issues to be decided. The Silver Member, the
Titanium Family Designee and the Company shall cooperate with one another as
promptly as reasonably practicable in the production and discovery of
reasonably requested or ordered documents, information or other materials
that are relevant to the issues to be decided, and in the submission and
presentation of arguments to the Qualified Expert. Nothing in this Section
6.22 shall limit the rights of any Member under this Agreement to obtain or
request information from the Company or to use those rights to obtain
information or material for use in an arbitration pursuant to this Section
6.22. At a reasonable time in advance of a hearing, the Silver Member and the
Titanium Family Designee will provide the other with (a) copies of all
materials upon which the Silver Member or the Titanium Family Designee, as
applicable, will rely or intends to present at the hearing; and (b) a
statement of the identity of each witness the Silver Member or the Titanium
Family Designee, as applicable, intends to call and the subject matter of the
expected testimony. The Qualified Expert shall unilaterally decide the dispute
in a written decision which shall be conclusive, final and binding (and which
shall designate either the Silver Member or the Titanium Family Designee, at
the discretion of the Qualified Expert, as the predominately prevailing party
in such dispute), and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to
engage in any transaction or take any action that was the subject of the
dispute to the extent that the Qualified Expert determines in the written
decision that such transaction or action is permissible and such transaction
or action is consistent with the other terms of this Agreement. The Qualified
Expert conducting any arbitration shall be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement and shall not have the power to add to, subtract from or otherwise
modify such provisions. The Company and the Members and the Titanium Family
Designee agree that, with respect to Deadlocks, the ruling of the
Qualified Expert shall be final and not be subject to any judicial review.
All fees and expenses of the arbitration proceeding, including the fees and
expenses of the Qualified Expert, shall be borne by the Company. For purposes
of this Section 6.22, the term  " _Qualified Expert_ " means a real estate
professional in good standing having at least fifteen (15) years of
experience in commercial real estate finance and the development, operation
and management of commercial shopping malls similar to the
commercial shopping malls owned by the Company, and who has served as an
arbitrator in at least five (5) American Arbitration
Association arbitrations.

obtained (if at all) as provided herein. The " _Excluded Fundamental

   | Section 6.23| REIT Requirements. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  At any time that Silver Parent intends to qualify as a Real
Estate Investment Trust, the Company shall be operated as if the Company were
a Real Estate Investment Trust, and in connection therewith, the Company shall
(i) monitor and manage the income and assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries in order for the Company to satisfy all Real Estate Investment
Trust qualification requirements, (ii) not cause or permit the Company and
the Subsidiaries to engage in any transactions that could reasonably be
expected to cause Silver Parent to be subject to federal income tax, including
under Section 857(b)(5), Section 857(b)(6), Section 857(b)(7) or Section
4981(a) of the Code, so long as such taxes may be imposed and as such
provisions may be amended from time to time, or corresponding provisions of
succeeding law, (iii) cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to operate in
such a manner and take or omit to take all actions as may be reasonably
necessary (including making distributions as provided for herein), so as to
permit Silver Parent to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust
under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code so long as such requirements exist
and as such provisions may be amended from time to time, or corresponding
provisions of succeeding law and (iv) perform any work and provide the Silver
Member with information, in each case, reasonably necessary for Silver Parent
to determine its status as a Real Estate Investment Trust (including
information set forth in the last sentence of Section 5.6) and monitor its
taxable income as a result of its direct or indirect interest in the Company
(clauses (i)-(iv), the " _REIT Requirements_ "), each of (ii) and (iii) to at
all times be determined (A) as if Silver Parent's sole asset is its indirect
Membership Interest and (B) without regard to the action or inaction of Silver
Parent with respect to distributions (by way of dividends or otherwise) and
the timing thereof. The Silver Member may cause the Company, at the Company's
expense, to obtain an opinion of tax counsel selected by the Silver Member,
regarding the impact of any proposed action (i) in the event that such
proposed action would, in the reasonable discretion of the Silver Member,
create a material risk that Silver Parent, any Affiliate of Silver Parent
that intends to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust or the Company would
not meet the requirements to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (in
the case of the Company, if it were a Real Estate Investment Trust), or (ii)
on Silver Parent's exposure to an excise tax under Section 4981(a) of the
Code, or a tax under Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, so long as such taxes
exist and as such provisions may be amended from time to time or corresponding
provisions of succeeding law. Notwithstanding anything herein or on Exhibit I
to the contrary, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Officers shall be
deemed to comply with the REIT Requirements and this Section 6.23 to the
extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries operate in such a manner or take
or omit to take any action (or take any tax position) (x) at the direction of
the Silver Member, (y) consistent with the tax opinion described in the
immediately foregoing sentence to the extent such opinion concludes that
operating in such manner or taking or failing to take any action or tax
position is consistent with the applicable Person's qualification as a Real
Estate Investment Trust or (z) otherwise consented to by the Silver Member.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time that
Silver Parent intends to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any of the actions
prohibited by Exhibit I without the prior written consent of the
Silver Member, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be restricted from (or required to obtain the prior written
consent of the Silver Member before) taking any action pursuant to any
binding written arrangement entered into prior to, and effective as of, the
Effective Date (provided that this proviso shall not limit the obligations of
the Company under Section 6.23(b)); _provided_ , _further_ , that for all
applicable purposes of Exhibit I, the Company shall be entitled to rely upon
the Silver Parent Related Party Tenant Schedule (as such term is defined in
Exhibit I) so long as the Company has complied with the obligations in Section
8 of Exhibit I. At any time that Silver Parent intends to qualify as a Real
Estate Investment Trust, the Silver Member shall, in a timely manner,
provide the Company and its Officers with all information reasonably
requested by the Company for purposes of ascertaining its compliance with
this Section 6.23. After the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any
entity that is currently a TRS of Titanium to file a joint election with
Silver Parent on IRS Form 8875 to be treated as a TRS of Silver Parent. To the
extent that any such entity that is not controlled by the Company is not able
or willing to make such an election, the Company agrees to transfer its
interest in such entity to a Subsidiary of the Company that is treated as a
TRS of Silver Parent.

(b)  Upon the reasonable request of the Silver Member, after
consulting in good faith with the Titanium Family Designee, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause one or more services provided by the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to any binding written
arrangement entered into prior to, and effective as of, the Effective Date to
be restructured (for example, by performing such services through one or more
TRSs that is or are directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company) or
(ii) transfer assets to one or more TRSs that is or are directly or indirectly
wholly owned by the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) shall
take such other action as reasonably necessary, based on written advice of tax
counsel (which written advice, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any
advice in e-mail), to satisfy the REIT Requirements.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 6.19
and Section 6.20), all legal instruments affecting the Company or Company
property need be executed by, and only by, that Person or those Persons
designated in writing as Officers or Authorized Signatories by the Chief
Executive Officer during the Titanium Period and by the Board of Directors

and Reimbursement; Advancement of Expenses and Insurance; Other.

(a)  To the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but
without waiving or limiting any express contractual obligation contained in
this Agreement), no Director, Officer (including the Chief Executive
Officer), Member, Partnership Representative or Designated Individual of the
Partnership Representative (in each case, in such capacity) shall owe any
fiduciary or other duty to the Company or any Member or any Preferred Holder,
in each case, except as expressly set forth below in Section 6.25(b). In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Member and each Preferred Holder
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and acknowledges that the other
Members and Preferred Holders irrevocably and unconditionally waive, to the
fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, any fiduciary or other duty that
could be deemed to be owed to any Member or any Preferred Holder or to the
Company by it, any Member, any Preferred Holder, any Partnership

Officer), except as expressly set forth below in Section 6.25(b) or any of the
other express contractual obligations contained in this Agreement.

(b)  Each of the Directors (during the Silver Period, but
excluding with respect to (i) the exercise of any approval
requirements provided for in this Agreement and (ii) Section 7.2, in each
case as to which no such fiduciary duties shall attach), Officers (including
the Chief Executive Officer) and Authorized Signatories shall owe to the
Company, the Members and the Preferred Holders only those fiduciary duties
that would be owed by a director (with respect to a Director) or an officer
(with respect to an Officer or Authorized Signatory) of the Company if the
Company were a Delaware corporation.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
no Director, Officer (including the Chief Executive Officer) or Authorized
Signatory shall be liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty
(that is applicable to such Person pursuant to Section 6.25(b)) to the
Company or any Member or any Preferred Holder; _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not eliminate or limit the liability of any Director (during the Silver
Period, but excluding with respect to (x) the exercise of any
approval requirements provided for in this Agreement and (y) Section 7.2, in
each case as to which no such fiduciary duties shall attach) or Officer
(including the Chief Executive Officer) or Authorized Signatory (i) for any
breach of such Director's or Officer's or Authorized Signatory's duty of
loyalty, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or (iii) for any
transaction from which such Director, Officer or Authorized Signatory derived
an improper personal benefit, in each case, to the extent the same could not
be eliminated with respect to a Person with such fiduciary duties (assuming
an Officer or Authorized Signatory is deemed to be a director for this
purpose) pursuant to Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

  



  

(d)  A Director, Officer (including the Chief Executive
Officer), Authorized Signatory or Partnership Representative shall be fully
protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements
presented to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries by any Person as to
matters such Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's
professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable
care by or on behalf of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and
amount of the assets, liabilities, Profits or Losses or any other facts
pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which distributions to
Members or Preferred Holders might properly be paid. The preceding sentence
shall in no way limit any Person's right to rely on information to the extent
provided in Section 18-406 of the Act.

  



  

(e)  No Director shall be disqualified from voting on matters as
to which such Director or the Member that appointed such Director may have a
conflict of interest.

(f)  To the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law as the
same would apply to a Delaware corporation, the Company shall and does hereby
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from any claim,
demand, or liability, and from any loss, cost, judgment or expense including
attorneys' fees and court costs, which may be asserted against, imposed upon,
or suffered or otherwise incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of the
fact that such Person is or was a Member, an Affiliate of a Member, a
Director, Officer (including the Chief Executive Officer), Authorized
Signatory, or serves or served at the request of any of the Company or the
Board of Directors or any Officer (including the Chief Executive Officer) as a
member, manager, partner, director, officer, employee or agent of any other
enterprise or by reason of any act performed for or on behalf of the Company,
or in furtherance of the Company's business, if such Indemnified Person
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Company and all of its Members and
Preferred Holders collectively, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. Any indemnity under this Section 6.25 shall be provided out of and
to the extent of Company assets only, and only with respect to amounts
actually and reasonably incurred, and no Member or Preferred Holder shall
have any personal liability on account thereof.

  



  

(g)  Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an
Indemnified Person in defending any Action relating to any action or omission
in respect of the Company and for which the indemnification above may be
applicable shall be paid by the Company promptly upon receipt by it of an
undertaking of such Indemnified Person to repay such expenses if it shall
ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company.

  



  

(h)  The rights provided to any Indemnified Person by this
Section 6.25 shall be enforceable against the Company by such Indemnified
Person, who shall be presumed to have relied upon it in serving or continuing
to serve as a Member, Preferred Holder, Director, Officer (including the
Chief Executive Officer), Partnership Representative, Authorized Signatory,
member, manager, partner, director, officer, employee or agent as provided
above.

  



  

(i)  The Company shall purchase and maintain customary
insurance, as reasonably determined by the Chief Executive Officer during the
Titanium Period and by Board of Directors during the Silver Period, in respect
of each Indemnified Person against any liability relating to any act or
omission in respect of the Company, whether or not the Company may indemnify
such Indemnified Person against such liability under this Agreement.

  



  

(j)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Company shall not indemnify any Indemnified Person on account of,
or otherwise relating to, (x) any breach by such Indemnified Person of this
Agreement (but not including a breach of such Indemnified Person's fiduciary
duties to the extent that indemnification for such a breach would be available
under this Agreement) or any other agreement between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Person or any
Affiliate of such Indemnified Person, on the other hand, in each case as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (y) any legal proceeding
brought by any Indemnified Person against the Company, its Affiliates or its
Members (other than any legal proceeding seeking indemnification to which
such Indemnified Person is entitled under this Section 6.25, as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction).

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(k)  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 6.25 shall survive the liquidation,
dissolution and termination of the Company and the termination or amendment of
this Agreement, shall continue as to any Person who has terminated his, her
or its relationship with the Company and shall inure to the benefit of such
Person's heirs, executors and administrators and shall, to the extent
permitted by the Act, be binding on the Company's successors and assigns.

  



  

(l)  No amendment of this Section 6.25 shall impair the rights
of any Indemnified Person arising at any time with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring prior to such amendment.

  



  

(m)  The indemnification provided by the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.25 shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any
Person may be entitled, including any right under policies of insurance that
may be purchased and maintained by the Company or others. The Company hereby
acknowledges that certain Indemnified Persons may have rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance provided by Silver
Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the " _Alternative Indemnitors_ "). The Company hereby agrees
that, as to its indemnification obligations under this Section 6.25, (i) it
is the indemnitor of first resort ( _i.e._ , its obligations to any such
Indemnified Persons are primary and any obligation of the Alternative
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by such Indemnified Person are secondary),
(ii) it shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Person and shall be liable for the full amount of all such
expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the
extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement (or
any other agreement between the Company and such Indemnified Person), without
regard to any rights such Indemnified Person may have against the Alternative
Indemnitors and (iii) the Company irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases the Alternative Indemnitors from any and all claims against the
Alternative Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement
or payment by the Alternative Indemnitors on behalf of such
Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which any Indemnified Person
has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing and
the Alternative Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution or be
subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights
of recovery of such Indemnified Person in such regard against the Company. The
Company and such Indemnified Person agree that the Alternative Indemnitors
are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this Section 6.25(m).

  



   | Section 6.26| Partnership Representative. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
Taubman Ventures Group, LLC is hereby designated as the
"partnership representative" under Section 6223(a) of the Code (the "
_Partnership Representative_ "); _provided_  that, during the Silver Period,
the Silver Member may designate the Partnership Representative. The
Partnership Representative shall recommend to the Company, on an annual basis
or at such other time as the individual resigns or its designation is
revoked, an individual who meets the requirements of Section 6223 of the Code
and the Regulations promulgated thereunder to serve as the designated
individual (the " _Designated Individual_ ") to act on the Company's behalf,
which recommendation shall be subject to Silver Member's approval, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No Member or Preferred Holder
may revoke the authority of the Partnership Representative or of the
Designated Individual without the Partnership Representative's prior written
consent. The Partnership Representative shall have full authority to bind the
Company in all proceedings with the Internal Revenue Service, and each Member
and Preferred Holder agrees to be bound by the actions taken by the
Partnership Representative as provided in Section 6223(b) of the Code.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(b)  Subject to Section 6.26(f), the Partnership Representative
shall or shall cause the Company to make the election under Section 6226(a)
of the Code (the " _Push-Out Election_ ") to apply the alternative procedure
to the Company's payment of any "imputed underpayment" as determined under
Section 6225 of the Code (the " _Imputed Underpayment_ ") and associated
interest, adjustments to tax, and penalties arising from a partnership-level
adjustment that are imposed on the Company so that they are borne by the
Members and Preferred Holders and former Members and former Preferred Holders
to whom such Imputed Underpayment relates as determined in good faith by the
Partnership Representative. The Partnership Representative is authorized to
take any other actions as shall be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and
comply with the Push-Out Election. Each Member and Preferred Holder consents
to the Push-Out Election and agrees to take any reasonable action reasonably
requested by the Partnership Representative to effectuate the Push-Out
Election and to furnish the Partnership Representative with any information
reasonably necessary to give effect to the Push-Out Election.

  



  

(c)  In connection with the Push-Out Election, the Partnership
Representative shall provide each Member and Preferred Holder or former
Member or former Preferred Holder for the reviewed year (as defined in
Regulations Section 301.6241-1(a)(8)) (the " _Reviewed Year_ ") a statement
as required by Regulations Section 301.6226-2 setting forth the applicability
of any penalty, additions to tax, or additional amounts, and the adjustments
to which those penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts relate,
and each Member and Preferred Holder for the Reviewed Year (the " _Reviewed
Year Member_ ") shall compute any penalties, additions to tax, or additional
amounts applicable to it as if each correction amount were an underpayment or
understatement for the first affected year (or intervening year). Each
Reviewed Year Member or former Reviewed Year Member shall provide the
Partnership Representative such reasonable documentation as may be reasonably
requested by the Partnership Representative proving payment of the liability
pushed out to such Reviewed Year Member pursuant to the Push-Out Election or a
further Push-Out Election made by such Reviewed Year Member.

  



  

(d)  In the event the Company is a direct or indirect member of
another partnership or limited liability company (the "
_Subsidiary Partnership_ ") that is under audit and makes a Push-Out Election
(including the case in which there are successive Push-Out Elections through
a chain of Subsidiary Partnerships), then the Partnership Representative shall
or shall cause the Company to make a further Push-Out election (the "
_Further Push-Out Election_ ") so that the Imputed Underpayment and
associated interest, adjustments to tax, and penalties arising from an audit
of a Subsidiary Partnership are borne by the Members and Preferred Holders
and former Members and former Preferred Holders of the Company to whom such
Imputed Underpayment relates as determined by the Partnership Representative.
If a Further Push-Out Election is made, the provisions of Section 6.26(b) and
Section 6.26(c) shall apply with respect to the Further Push-Out Election.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(e)  Subject to Section 6.26(f), if for any reason, including
the inability to make an effective Push-Out Election or Further Push-Out
Election, the Company is assessed the Imputed Underpayment, associated
interest, adjustments to tax, or penalties (all such amounts being referred
to as the " _Adjustment Liability_ "), the Company shall effect a modification
of the Imputed Underpayment by applying the procedure set forth in Section
6225(c)(2)(B) of the Code and require the Members and Preferred Holders to
pay the Adjustment Liability directly to the Internal Revenue Service so that
the Adjustment Liability is borne by the Members and Preferred Holders and
former Members and former Preferred Holders to whom such Imputed Underpayment
relates as determined by the Partnership Representative. The Company shall
give written notice to each Reviewed Year Member and former Reviewed
Year Member of its share of the Adjustment Liability and the information
required for the alternative procedure to filing an "amended return
modification" as provided in Regulations Section 301.6225-2(d)(2)(x) (the "
_Alternative Procedure_ "), including the mailing date of the notice of
proposed partnership adjustment (the " _NOPPA_ "), and each Member
and Preferred Holder agrees to follow the Alternative Procedure and to timely
pay its share of the Adjustment Liability, if any, directly to the Internal
Revenue Service. Each Member and Preferred Holder further agrees to provide
the Company the documentation reasonably required by Regulations Section
301.6225-2(c)(2) and (d)(2) (and by any additional Internal Revenue Service
guidance provided pursuant to the Proposed Regulations) evidencing its
payment to the Internal Revenue Service of its share of the Adjustment
Liability not later than sixty (60) Days prior to the due date for the
Company's request for modification of the Imputed Underpayment, which is two
hundred seventy (270) Days after the date of the mailing of the NOPPA. If the
Member or Preferred Holder is a " _Pass-Through Partner_ " (as defined in
Regulations Section 301.6241-1(a)(5)), then such Pass-Through Partner shall
(x) require its partners or members to follow the Alternative Procedure and
provide such Pass-Through Partner with the documentation reasonably required
by Regulations Section 301.6225-2(c)(2) and (d)(2) (and by any additional
Internal Revenue Service guidance provided pursuant to the Proposed
Regulations) supporting the computation and payment of the Adjustment
Liability by its partners or members and (y) provide such documentation to
the Company not later than sixty (60) Days prior to the due date for the
Company's request for a modification of the Imputed Underpayment. If a Member
or Preferred Holder fails to timely submit all required evidence of proper
execution of the Alternative Procedure and the payment to the Internal Revenue
Service of its share of the Adjustment Liability or of its partners' or
members' payment of their respective shares of the Adjustment Liability to the
Internal Revenue Service, then the Company shall (i) withhold such Member's
or Preferred Holder's share of the Adjustment Liability, if any, from cash
otherwise currently distributable to such Member or Preferred Holder pursuant
to this Agreement and (ii) to the extent cash is not distributable to such
Member or Preferred Holder for the taxable quarter in which the
Adjustment Liability must be paid, but in all events prior to the date on
which the Adjustment Liability must be paid, the Failure to Comply Remedies
shall apply. In the event the Internal Revenue Service denies the Company's
modification request in whole or in part, then the Company shall give written
notice to each Member and Preferred Holder not less than thirty (30) Days
prior to the date the Company must make the payment of the Adjustment
Liability to the Internal Revenue Service, setting forth each Member's or
Preferred Holder's share, if any, of the Adjustment Liability and the date on
which the Company must make the payment, and each Member and Preferred Holder
shall, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date the Company
must pay the Adjustment Liability to the Internal Revenue Service, make a
payment to the Company in readily available funds of such Member's or
Preferred Holder's share of the Adjustment Liability. If a Member or
Preferred Holder fails to timely make such payment to the Company, then the
Failure to Comply Remedies shall apply. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the Members or Preferred Holders shall be
required to amend any Tax Return in accordance with Section 6225(c)(2) of the
Code (or any similar provisions under state or local law).

(f)  Notwithstanding Section 6.26(b), Section 6.26(d) and
Section 6.26(e), the Partnership Representative shall decide to make or not
to make the Push-Out Election (or the Further Push-Out Election) or elect to
follow the Alternative Procedure. If the Company does not elect the Push-Out
Election (or the Further Push-Out Election) or the Alternative Procedure, then
the Company shall (i) withhold such Member's or Preferred Holder's share of
the Adjustment Liability, if any, from cash otherwise currently distributable
to such Member or Preferred Holder pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) to the
extent cash is not distributable to such Member or Preferred Holder for the
taxable quarter in which the Adjustment Liability must be paid, but in all
events prior to the date on which the Adjustment Liability must be paid, the
Failure to Comply Remedies shall apply. If the Subsidiary Partnership does
not elect the Push-Out Election (or the Further Push-Out Election), the
Alternative Procedure, or if the Internal Revenue Service denies the
Subsidiary Partnership's modification request in whole or in part, then the
Company shall give written notice to each Member and Preferred Holder not
less than thirty (30) Days prior to the date the Company must make the payment
to the Subsidiary Partnership, setting forth each Member's or Preferred
Holder's share, if any, of the Adjustment Liability and the date on which the
Company must make the payment, and each Member and Preferred Holder shall, not
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date the Company must pay the
Adjustment Liability to the Subsidiary Partnership, make a payment to the
Company in readily available funds of such Member's or Preferred Holder's
share of the Adjustment Liability; provided, that the Company may, at the
reasonable discretion of the Partnership Representative, waive such
requirements of the Members and Preferred Holders to pay the Adjustment
Liability if the Company's payment of such Adjustment Liability would have no
more than a minimal adverse effect on the Company, the Company's assets, any
Member or any Preferred Holder. If a Member or Preferred Holder fails to
timely make such payment to the Company, then the Failure to Comply Remedies
shall apply.

  



  

(g)  In the event a Subsidiary Partnership does not or is unable
to make an effective Push-Out Election, is required to pay its Adjustment
Liability, and elects to follow the Alternative Procedure, then each Member,
Preferred Holder and each Pass-Through Partner shall follow the procedures
and timing set forth above in Section 6.26(e) for payment of its share of the
Adjustment Liability to the Internal Revenue Service and the provision of the
required documentation to the Company. If a Member or Preferred Holder fails
to timely submit all required evidence of proper execution of the Alternative
Procedure and the payment to the Internal Revenue Service of its share of the
Adjustment Liability or of its partners' or members' respective shares of the
Adjustment Liability to the Internal Revenue Service, then the Failure to
Comply Remedies shall apply. Alternatively, if the Subsidiary
Partnership does not elect to follow the Alternative Procedure, or if the
Internal Revenue Service denies the Subsidiary Partnership's modification
request in whole or in part, then the Company shall give written notice to
each Member and Preferred Holder not less than thirty (30) Days prior to the
date the Company must make the payment to the Subsidiary Partnership, setting
forth each Member's or Preferred Holder's share, if any, of the Adjustment
Liability and the date on which the Company must make the payment, and each
Member and Preferred Holder shall, not later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the date the Company must pay the Adjustment Liability to the
Subsidiary Partnership, make a payment to the Company in readily available
funds of such Member's or Preferred Holder's share of the Adjustment
Liability. If a Member or Preferred Holder fails to timely make such payment
to the Company, then the Failure to Comply Remedies shall apply.

(h)  For the purpose of determining a Member's and a Preferred
Holder's Capital Account, any amount of cash otherwise distributable to a
Member or Preferred Holder that is retained by the Company pursuant to this
Section 6.26 shall be treated as if such cash had been actually distributed
to such Member or Preferred Holder pursuant to Section 5.2 or Section
10.5(a), as applicable. Any Adjustment Liability actually remitted or deemed
remitted to the Company by a Member or Preferred Holder pursuant to this
Section 6.26 shall not increase such Member's or Preferred Holder's Capital
Account and shall be treated as a reimbursement to the Company by such Member
or Preferred Holder of such Member's or Preferred Holder's share of the
Adjustment Liability paid or to be paid by the Company to the Internal Revenue
Service on such Member's or Preferred Holder's behalf.

  



  

(i)  The Partnership Representative shall keep the Board of
Directors apprised of the status of any Company audit or court proceeding.

  



  

(j)  Any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Partnership Representative in serving as such shall be at the Company's
expense and shall be paid by the Company, and notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted to pay any such amounts,
including through borrowing for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it shall be the responsibility of each Member and Preferred Holder, at its
own expense, to employ tax counsel to represent its separate interests. No
Member or Preferred Holder shall file a notice with the Internal Revenue
Service under Section 6222(c) of the Code in connection with such Member's or
Preferred Holder's intention to treat an item on such Member's or
Preferred Holder's federal income tax return in a manner that is inconsistent
with the treatment of such item on the Company's federal income tax return,
unless such Member or Preferred Holder has, not less than thirty (30) Days
prior to the filing of such notice, provided the Partnership Representative
with a copy of the notice and thereafter in a timely manner provides such
other information related thereto as the Partnership Representative shall
reasonably request.

  



  

(k)  The provisions of this Section 6.26 and a Member's and
Preferred Holder's obligation to reimburse the Company pursuant to this
Section 6.26 shall survive such Member's and Preferred Holder's membership in
the Company and the dissolution, liquidation, winding up, and termination of
the Company, and for purposes of this Section 6.26, the Company shall be
treated as continuing in existence. The Company may pursue and enforce all
rights and remedies it may have against a Member or Preferred Holder under
this Section 6.26, including instituting a lawsuit to collect reimbursement
with interest calculated at the Interest Rate. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, the provisions contained in this Section 6.26 shall be
binding on the Company's successors and assigns.

  



  

(l)  The Partnership Representative shall be responsible for
representing the Company in all dealings with any state, local, or foreign
tax authority and shall have the authority to make all state, local, and
foreign tax elections and to settle any state, local, or foreign tax audits.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(m)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.26, without the prior written consent of the Silver Member (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) for so long as a
member of the Titanium Family Group is the Partnership Representative, or
without the prior written consent of the Titanium Family Designee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) for so
long as the Silver Member designates the Partnership Representative and the
Titanium Family Group (together with any Family Transferees) continues to own,
collectively, twenty-five percent (25%) of the Membership Interests owned by
the Titanium Family Group as of the Effective Date, the Partnership
Representative shall not:

  



  

(i)  make any tax elections (including the Push-Out Election
or the Further Push-Out Election) or decisions, in each case, under the New
Partnership Audit Rules, including with respect to any Internal Revenue
Service examination of the Company commenced under Section 6231(a) of the
Code;

  



  

(ii)  make any decision to initiate any administrative or
judicial proceedings involving the Company under the New Partnership Audit
Rules;

  



  

(iii)  make a request for administrative adjustment under Section
6227 of the Code;

  



  

(iv)  file a petition for readjustment under Section 6234 of the
Code (including choice of judicial forum) with respect to a final partnership
administrative adjustment;

  



  

(v)  appeal an adverse judicial decision;

  



  

(vi)  make any decision regarding the compromise, settlement, or
dismissal of any of the foregoing proceedings;

  



  

(vii)  enter into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue
Service; or

  



  

(viii) enter into any material agreement, including a waiver of the
statute of limitations, with the Internal Revenue Service;

  



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for so long as the Silver Member designates
the Partnership Representative and the Titanium Family Group (together with
any Family Transferees) continues to own, collectively, five percent (5%) of
the Membership Interests owned by the Titanium Family Group as of the
Effective Date, the Partnership Representative shall consult in good faith
with the Titanium Family Designee regarding any of the foregoing with respect
to a taxable period for which the Titanium Family Group (together with any
Family Transferees) owned twenty five percent (25%) of the Membership
Interests owned by the Titanium Family Group as of the Effective Date.

  



  

(n)  In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.26, the Partnership Representative shall (i) promptly provide the other
Members with copies of all material written notices and communications from
the Internal Revenue Service, (ii) promptly inform the other Members of the
substance of any material oral communication with the Internal Revenue
Service, (iii) consult regularly with the other Members and keep them
apprised of the status of any audit or court proceeding, (iv) provide the
Silver Member with a reasonable opportunity to comment on written submissions
to the Internal Revenue Service and shall, in good faith, consider any
reasonable comments on such written submissions by the Silver Member and (v)
use reasonable best efforts to provide a single representative of the Silver
Member the opportunity to participate in all scheduled communications and
meetings with the Internal Revenue Service. To the extent applicable, this
Section 6.26(n) shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to other federal, state, local
or foreign tax proceeding or audit.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(o)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
for so long as a member of the Titanium Family Group is the Partnership
Representative, the Partnership Representative and Designated Individual shall
consult in good faith with, and obtain the consent of (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Silver Member with respect
to any and all material tax elections and actions and decisions with respect
to taxes (" _Tax Actions_ "), including any Tax Action with respect to the
method of allocation of Profits and Losses to Capital Accounts for tax
purposes, the maintenance of Capital Accounts, any tax election (excluding
any election under the New Partnership Audit Rules or any other tax
proceeding or audit), any material change in method of tax accounting and any
material position on any tax return (provided, that any Tax Actions pursuant
to Section 5.1(d)(iii) shall be deemed to be material).

  



  

(p)   For so long as the Silver Member designates the
Partnership Representative and the Titanium Family Group (together with any
Family Transferees) continues to own, collectively, five percent (5%) of the
Membership Interests owned by the Titanium Family Group as of the Effective
Date, the Partnership Representative shall consult in good faith with the
Titanium Family Designee regarding any material change of tax policy or
election and any other Tax Action which is disproportionately and materially
adverse to the Titanium Family Group taken as a whole.

  



  

(q)  To the extent applicable, this Section 6.26 shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ to any Subsidiaries of the Company.

  



  

Section 6.27  Security with Respect to Tax Loans.

  



  

Any Tax Loan made to a Member or Preferred Holder pursuant to this Agreement
shall be secured by a security interest in such Member's or Preferred
Holder's Membership Interest. Each Member or Preferred Holder receiving a Tax
Loan hereby grants the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, as the case
may be (each, a " _Lender_ "), a security interest in its interest in the
Company, including a security interest in all distributions such Member or
Preferred Holder may be entitled to receive under this Agreement and any and
all rights to consent under this Agreement. The Lender is hereby authorized to
prepare and file a UCC-1 statement covering such Member's or Preferred
Holder's Membership Interest and reflecting the security interest granted to
the Lender. A Member or Preferred Holder receiving a Tax Loan hereby agrees to
cooperate with the Lender and execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such promissory notes, security agreements, financing
statements, transfer powers, proxies, instruments, and documents and take
such other action as the Lender may reasonably request from time to time to
carry out the provisions of this Section 6.27. Each Member or Preferred
Holder receiving a Tax Loan grants the Lender an irrevocable power
of attorney to execute any and all such documents and instruments on such
Member's or Preferred Holder's behalf in the event such Member or Preferred
Holder fails to timely execute and deliver any of the foregoing. The power of
attorney hereby granted is coupled with an interest and shall survive the
granting Member's or Preferred Holder's death or disability.

   | Section 6.28| Certain Actions. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if Silver Parent is required by a Governmental Entity to sell all or a
substantial portion of, otherwise divest all or a substantial portion of, or
agree to any other Regulatory Concession that would have a material adverse
effect on, the property described on Schedule VI as the " _Restricted
Property_ " as a result of an Action arising from or otherwise relating to
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and if selling all or
a substantial portion of, otherwise divesting all or a substantial portion of,
or subjecting to a Regulatory Concession, the property described on Schedule
VI as the " _Applicable Company Property_ " would result in such
Governmental Entity not requiring a sale of all or a substantial portion of,
divestiture of all or a substantial portion of or applicable
Regulatory Concession with respect to, the Restricted Property, then, and
only in such case and subject to compliance with the provisions of Section
6.28(c), the Silver Directors shall have the authority to cause the Company
and any Company Subsidiary to sell or divest all or a substantial portion of
the Applicable Company Property, or to subject the Applicable Company Property
to a Regulatory Concession, and to manage, control and settle all decisions
and actions of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect thereto, so long
as the Company receives all of the net proceeds from such sale, divestiture or
Regulatory Concession (if any) and such net proceeds are distributed to the
Members in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) (without giving effect to Section
10.5(a)(i)) and 10.5(b).

  



  

(b)  In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if Silver Parent or the Company is required by a
Governmental Entity to sell or otherwise divest any property of either Silver
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to subject
any such property to a Regulatory Concession, in each case other than the
Applicable Company Property (but without derogation of the provisions of
Section 6.28(a) as to the Applicable Company Property) or the property
described on Schedule VI as the " _Section 6.28(b) Property_ ", as a result
of an Action arising from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, then, and only in such case and subject to compliance with the
provisions of Section 6.28(c), the Silver Directors shall have the authority
to cause the Company and any Company Subsidiary to sell or divest any such
property, or to subject such property to a Regulatory Concession, and to
manage, control and settle all decisions and actions of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect thereto, so long as the Company receives all of the
net proceeds from such sale, divestiture or Regulatory Concession (if any)
and such net proceeds are distributed to the Members in accordance with
Sections 10.5(a) (without giving effect to Section 10.5(a)(i)) and 10.5(b),
but provided that any such action by Silver Parent and the Silver Directors
shall be taken upon, and only upon, the condition that Silver Parent shall
have reasonably made the decision to sell or divest such property, or to
subject such property to a Regulatory Concession, in good faith and taking
into account the best interests of the Company and of Silver Parent.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(c)  With respect to any Action commenced by a Governmental
Entity that has authority to enforce any Regulatory Law (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) arising from or otherwise relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, each of Silver Parent and the Titanium
Family Designee shall (i) consult and cooperate in good faith with each other
in connection with (1) any inquiry or Action relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any inquiry or Action
initiated by a Governmental Entity and (2) any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, response to questions or
information or document requests from any Governmental Entity, and any opinion
or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such inquiry or Action
and (ii) keep each other informed as promptly as practicable of any
communication received from, or given to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with any inquiry or Action relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or if such party acquires knowledge, or
otherwise becomes aware of any such inquiry or Action. Except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by Applicable Law, each of Silver
Parent and the Titanium Family Designee shall permit the other party to (A)
have reasonable access to, and be consulted in connection with, any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with any Action relating to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, (B) review prior to submission drafts of any proposed
filing with or submission to (including any response to questions from) any
Governmental Entity relating to any such Action and (C) participate at or in
each meeting, conference or telephone call with a representative of a
Governmental Entity relating to any such Action. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, and without limiting any of the consent or approval
requirements contained in this Agreement, solely with respect to any
Action commenced by a Governmental Entity that has authority to enforce any
Regulatory Law arising from or otherwise relating to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Silver Parent shall,
following consultation with the Titanium Family Designee in accordance with
the preceding sentence, and subject to Sections 6.28(a) and (b), (x) direct,
devise and implement the strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, or
for responding to any request from, or any inquiry or Action by (including
directing the timing, nature and substance of all such responses) any
Governmental Entity that has authority to enforce any Regulatory Law, (y)
have the right to lead all meetings and communications (including any
negotiations) with any Governmental Entity that has authority to enforce any
Regulatory Law and (z) control the defense and settlement of any inquiry or
Action brought by or before any Governmental Entity that has authority to
enforce any Regulatory Law.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if consent from any third party is required under the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' mortgage debt in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement but not obtained prior to the Effective Date and such
mortgage debt has not otherwise been refinanced by the Company or a Subsidiary
of the Company, then, if the Silver Member so elects, the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary shall refinance such mortgage debt with
indebtedness from Silver Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) on substantially similar terms to be
reasonably negotiated and agreed, with the costs of such refinancing
(including "breakage" costs) borne by the Company.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
from and after the effectiveness of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not bring any claims under the Merger Agreement other than
pursuant to Article I or Article II thereof.

   | Section 6.29| Company Reimbursements. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  Within thirty (30) Days of the date hereof, the Company
shall pay, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Silver Parent, on a dollar-for-dollar basis,
without duplication, (i) the amount of Transaction Expenses that were paid or
incurred by Titanium or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) at or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) and (ii) any amount (including legal fees,
expert fees, court costs, and other expenses) paid or incurred by Silver
Parent, Titanium or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to the Partnership Merger Effective
Time in connection with prosecuting, defending, settling or otherwise
resolving or attempting to resolve any Action arising from or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

(b)  From time to time following the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, promptly following request therefor by Silver Parent, the
Company shall pay, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Silver Parent, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, any amount (including legal fees, expert fees, court costs, and
other expenses) paid or incurred by Silver Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or from and after the
Partnership Merger Effective Time in connection with prosecuting, defending,
settling or otherwise resolving or attempting to resolve any Action arising
from or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (including as contemplated by Section 6.28).

  



  

(c)  Promptly following the payment by the Company of any
liability in connection with the termination of employment or service (or in
connection with any "single trigger" vesting pursuant to the 2018 Plan as
described in the OpComm Waiver) of any member of the Operating Committee
identified in Exhibit N, in each case, that would not have been incurred had
such member executed and delivered an OpComm Waiver (an " _OpComm Liability_
"), the Titanium Family Group shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to the Company an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the
excess of (A) the product of such OpComm Liability _multiplied by_ fifty
percent (50%) over (B) the product of such OpComm Liability _multiplied by_
the Percentage Interest of the Titanium Family Group and its Family
Transferees at such time _divided by_ (y) 1 minus the Percentage Interest of
the Titanium Family Group and its Family Transferees at such time. In lieu of
the foregoing payment, the Titanium Family Designee may elect, by written
notice to the Silver Member, to reduce the distributions that would
otherwise be payable to the Titanium Family Group pursuant to Section 5.2 by
the amount of such payment, on a dollar-for-dollar basis (in which case, for
the avoidance of doubt, any distributions to the Silver Member or its
Affiliates would not be so reduced), with such reduction applied to each
distribution following the date that such payment otherwise would have been
required to be made under this Section 6.29(c) until fully offset. An "
_OpComm Waiver_ " means a waiver in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit N.

  



   | Section 6.30| Transfer of Titanium Name. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Within one (1) year following the date on which no Common Units are owned by
any member of the Titanium Family Group or any Family Transferee (the " _Name
Transfer Date_ "), the Company shall, and Silver and Silver OP shall cause the
Company to: (a) transfer any and all of the Company's title, right and
interest in and to the "Taubman" name, to the extent any such rights exist as
of the Name Transfer Date, to a designee selected in writing by the Titanium
Family Designee and (b) take all actions necessary to change its legal,
registered, assumed, trade and "doing business as" name, as applicable, to a
name not containing "Taubman". For the avoidance of doubt, following the Name
Transfer Date, neither Silver nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall use the "Taubman" name as a legal,
registered, assumed, trade or "doing business as" name. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Company, Silver and each of
its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to use the "Taubman" name (i) for fair use
purposes or in a factual matter, (ii) in connection with litigation or legal
proceedings or (iii) to refer to or describe the history of the Company.

   | Section 7.1| General Acknowledgement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to Sections 7.2 and 7.3 and the fiduciary duties of the Directors,
Officers and Authorized Signatories, to the extent provided for herein, the
Members acknowledge and agree that each of them and their respective
constituents and Affiliates (and Directors appointed by any of them) may have
interests in other present or future ventures, of whatever nature, including
real estate, and further including ventures that are competitive with the
Company and that, notwithstanding their status as a Member in the Company or
as a Director, a Member and their respective constituents and Affiliates (and
Directors appointed by any of them) shall be entitled to obtain or continue
their respective individual participation in all such ventures without (i)
accounting to the Company or the other Members for any profits with respect
thereto, (ii) any obligation to advise the other Members of business
opportunities for the Company which may come to its or its constituents' or
Affiliates' attention as a result of its or its Affiliates' or constituents'
participation in such other ventures or in the Company and (iii) being subject
to any claims whatsoever on account of such participation.

  



   | Section 7.2| Company Business and Strategy and Business Opportunities. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding Section 7.1, so long as the Titanium Family
Group (together with any Family Transferees) continues to own, collectively,
at least fifty percent (50%) of the Membership Interests owned by the Titanium
Family Group as of the Effective Date (subject to any adjustment necessary to
account for any split, dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification
or similar event, in each case, in respect of the Membership Interests), (i)
Silver Parent and the Silver Member agree that any business opportunity or
venture of any kind (including owning, financing, acquiring, leasing
promoting, developing, improving, operating, managing and servicing real
property) first identified by the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Chief
Executive Officer or any other Officer and presented to the Board of
Directors prior to Silver Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) identifying such opportunity or venture other than
through the Board of Directors, the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall
(subject to this Section 7.2(a)) belong solely to the Company and (ii)
without the written consent of the Titanium Family Designee, Silver Parent
and the Silver Member and their respective Affiliates (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) shall not pursue, agree to or implement any such
opportunities or ventures. In the event that either (x) there is any
disagreement between the Titanium Family Designee, on the one hand, and
Silver Parent or the Silver Member, on the other hand, regarding whether such
business opportunity or venture was first identified by the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Chief Executive Officer or any other Officer and presented
to the Board of Directors prior to Silver Parent or its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) identifying such opportunity or
venture other than through the Board of Directors, the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (y) the Silver Directors reasonably believe that such
opportunity or venture reasonably and logically should be pursued by Silver
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(including due to there being a bona fide auction for such opportunity or
venture), notwithstanding the prior sentence, the Silver Directors and the
Titanium Directors shall negotiate in good faith in order to try to resolve
such disagreement or determine whether such conditions have been satisfied and
should prevail. If such Directors are unable to reach a mutually acceptable
resolution within fifteen (15) Days of the occurrence of such disagreement or
foregoing conditions being invoked, then the parties shall submit such
dispute, and the Titanium Family Designee or Silver Parent or the Silver
Member may cause such dispute to be submitted, to binding arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of, and procedures set forth in, Section 6.22.

(b)  If Silver Parent implements changes to its own policies
regarding human resources matters, internal controls over
financial reporting, treasury matters and other compliance matters that are
contrary to comparable policies of the Company, and if the failure to apply
such policies to the Company would reasonably be expected to prejudice Silver
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (for instance, by making it more difficult
for Silver Parent to comply with its own legal or other obligations as a
public company) other than to a _de minimis_ extent, the Company shall seek
to implement such changes to its own comparable policies, taking into
account the business and culture of the Company.

  



   | Section 7.3| Non-Compete. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  For so long as the Titanium Family Group (together with any
Family Transferees) continues to own, collectively, at least two percent (2%)
of the outstanding Common Units, and for a one (1)-year period thereafter,
neither RST nor WST nor any other individual Immediate Family member of RST
or WST that serves or has served after the Effective Date as a Director,
Officer or other senior employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (collectively, the " _Non-Compete Subject Persons_ ") shall, directly
or indirectly, other than in his or her capacity as a Director, Officer,
Authorized Signatory, Member or employee or agent of the Company (in each
case, for the benefit of the Company) or in his or her capacity as a director,
officer, manager, employee or agent of any of the Company's Subsidiaries (in
each case, for the benefit of such Subsidiary), engage in or operate
any business that is directly or indirectly competitive with the Titanium
Business (as the Titanium Business has been conducted prior to or during the
Titanium Period) or own any equity interest in, or manage or operate, any
entity that engages in any business that is directly or indirectly
competitive with the Titanium Business (as the Titanium Business has been
conducted prior to or during the Titanium Period) (a " _Competing Activity_ "
or " _Competing Activities_ ") in each case in any geographical area.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Competing Activity shall not include, and the
first sentence of this Section 7.3(a) shall not apply to, any business or
activities set forth on Schedule III.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 7.3(a) shall not
prohibit or otherwise apply to any of the following activities and matters
incidental thereto:

  



  

(i)  acquisitions of, or the holding of, equity interests in
any Person representing five percent (5%) or less during the Titanium Period
or ten percent (10%) or less during the Silver Period of the total equity
value and voting power of such Person on a passive basis (except that the
foregoing percentage threshold may be exceeded solely as a result of the pro
rata purchase or redemption by an issuer of its own securities); or

  



  

(ii)  acquisitions of, or the holding of, a direct or indirect
interest (including a Controlling interest) in any Person that is not
"principally engaged in the business of Competing Activities" (as that
expression is defined below), whether directly or through one (1) or more of
its Affiliates. For the purposes of this Section 7.3(b), a Person will be
deemed to be "principally engaged in the business of Competing Activities"
only if either (x) fifteen percent (15%) or more of the operating revenues of
such Person and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the most recent twelve (12)
month period ended before the date of determination were revenues derived
from one (1) or more Competing Activities or (y) five hundred million
Dollars ($500,000,000) or more of the operating revenues of such Person and
its Subsidiaries (whether or not consolidated) for the most recent twelve
(12) month period ended before the date of determination were revenues derived
from one (1) or more Competing Activities.

  



  

(c)  In the event that the Company, any Officer or any member of
the Titanium Family Group identifies any business opportunity or venture of
any kind (including owning, acquiring, promoting, developing, improving,
operating, managing and servicing real property) in the People's Republic of
China (" _New China Business_ "), the Company or the Titanium Family Group,
as applicable, shall present such New China Business to the Board of
Directors to authorize the Company to consummate and engage in such New China
Business. A determination by the Board of Directors with respect to such New
China Business shall be made within thirty (30) Days of such New China
Business being presented to the Board of Directors with such detail as is
reasonably necessary for the Board of Directors to make such determination.
In the event that the New China Business is not authorized by all of
the Silver Directors, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 7.3(a), RST, WST and each member of their Immediate Families (or
entities in which they hold any interest) shall be permitted to consummate and
engage in and operate such New China Business solely within China (so long as
such activities do not disrupt the day-to-day activities of the Chief
Executive Officer with respect to the Company in any material respect) and
the Company shall provide such management and development services
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of
financing) with respect to such New China Business as are approved by the
Silver Directors (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), in each case on standard prevailing market terms.

TRANSFERS OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS; 
 EXCHANGE RIGHTS; REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

  



   | Section 8.1| Transfers. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  No Member or Preferred Holder may, directly or indirectly,
Transfer all or any portion of its Membership Interest or, if such Member or
Preferred Holder is an entity, permit a direct or indirect Transfer of an
interest in such Member or Preferred Holder, to any Person, except as
specifically permitted in this Article VIII or as may be mutually agreed in
writing by the Silver Member and the Titanium Family Designee. Any purported
Transfer in violation of this Article VIII shall be null and void
and ineffective for all purposes, and shall not bind the Company.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a) but otherwise subject to
this Agreement, a Member may, directly or indirectly, Transfer all or any
portion of its Membership Interest (but not less than one (1) Unit of
Membership Interest) (and a Person who holds a direct or indirect ownership
interest in a Member may Transfer all or any portion of such Person's
ownership interest) to any other Member, to an entity consisting of or owned
entirely by one (1) or more of the foregoing Persons, to a wholly owned
Subsidiary of such Member, to the Company, to any Family Transferee or, in
the case of the Silver Member, to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Silver
Parent or Silver OP. A Transfer described in this Section 8.1(b) is referred
to as a " _Permitted Affiliate Transfer_ " and a transferee of such a
Permitted Affiliate Transfer is referred to as a " _Permitted Transferee_
". Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time following
a Permitted Affiliate Transfer the Permitted Transferee in such Permitted
Affiliate Transfer ceases to qualify as a Permitted Transferee, then all
Membership Interests then held by such Permitted Transferee (and all interest
and rights related thereto) will, without any further action required by such
Permitted Transferee, be automatically Transferred back to the transferor of
such Membership Interests, and such former Permitted Transferee and the
transferor shall take such action as the Company deems appropriate to document
and effect such Transfer. In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary (including Section 8.1(a)), Transfers of
ownership interests in Silver Parent or Silver OP or any change in a trustee
of any trust that is a Member or of any trust that holds a direct or
indirect interest in any Member may be made without restriction by the terms
of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a), the Silver Member (or any
of its Affiliates) may Transfer any Membership Interests following the
earlier of (x) the seventh (7th) anniversary of the date of this Agreement or
(y) the last day of the Titanium Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if none of Silver Parent or any its Subsidiaries hold any Common
Units or if no Silver Parent equity securities are listed for trading on a
national securities exchange, the Exchanging Members' rights to receive any
consideration other than cash pursuant to Section 8.4 shall be deemed modified
such that such right shall, thereafter, only represent the right to receive
cash in an amount that is determined in accordance with Section 8.4.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a), subject to applicable law,
each of the Members and any Person holding a direct or indirect ownership
interest in a Member shall be permitted to mortgage, hypothecate, or pledge
any of its Membership Interests or such ownership interests in respect of one
(1) or more _bona fide_ purpose (margin) or _bona fide_ non-purpose loans
(each, a " _Permitted Loan_ "). Any Permitted Loan entered into by a Member
or any of the foregoing Persons shall be with one (1) or more
Responsible Financial Institutions (or any other financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Silver Member) and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the ability of any lender (or
its securities' affiliate) or collateral agent to foreclose upon and sell,
dispose of or otherwise transfer any such Membership Interests or such
ownership interests mortgaged, hypothecated or pledged to secure the
obligations of the borrower following an event of default under a Permitted
Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, in
the event that any lender or other creditor under a Permitted Loan
transaction (including any agent or trustee on their behalf) or any affiliate
or transferee of the foregoing forecloses on Membership Interests that
constitute collateral for any Permitted Loan, (I) no lender, creditor, agent
or trustee on their behalf or affiliate or transferee of any of the foregoing
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any Member) shall be entitled to any
rights (other than the rights set forth in Section 8.4 and Section 8.5 as
though such Person was part of the Titanium Family Group (or the
Titanium Family Designee) with respect to such Membership Interests, the
rights to receive the distributions, return of contributions and allocations
with respect to such Membership Interest and the rights under Section 11.12)
hereunder, (II) such Membership Interests shall be deemed Transferred to such
lender, creditor, agent, trustee, affiliate or transferee (as applicable) for
all purposes hereunder and (III) such lender, creditor, agent, trustee,
affiliate or transferee (as applicable) shall be deemed the owner of such
Membership Interests.

  



  

   

75

 



    



   



  

(e)  If requested by a Member, the Company and the other
Members shall reasonably cooperate with such Member with respect to obtaining
any Permitted Loan, including entering into customary agreements with lenders
to facilitate such Permitted Loans; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in each
case such cooperation does not require the Company or any cooperating Member
to incur any material expense or liability or provide any guarantee or other
credit support (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
permitted to incur any such expense or liability or provide any such
guarantee or other credit support without the approval of the Board of
Directors).

  



   | Section 8.2| General Provisions Regarding Transfers. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  Upon any Transfer by a Member of all of its Common Units,
that Member shall cease to be a Member under this Agreement. Upon any
Transfer by a Preferred Holder of all of its Preferred Units, that Preferred
Holder shall cease to be a Preferred Holder under this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

  



  

(i)  No Transfer of Membership Interests by any Member or
Preferred Holder will be permitted, unless the transferee in such
Transfer (if not already a Member or Preferred Holder) executes an Adoption
Agreement consenting to becoming a Member or Preferred Holder and to be bound
by all provisions of this Agreement that the transferor is subject to. Upon
such execution, the Company shall cause Schedule I to be amended to add such
transferee as a Member or Preferred Holder hereunder;

  



  

(ii)  No Transfer shall be permitted if such Transfer would (A)
cause the Company to be treated as a publicly traded partnership within the
meaning of Section 7704 of the Code and Regulations Section 1.7704-1, (B)
cause the Company to be classified other than as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes, (C) cause all or any portion of the assets of the Company
to constitute as plan assets as defined in the Plan Asset Regulation under
ERISA, or (D) cause the Company to be required to register the Membership
Interests under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the securities laws of
any non-U.S. jurisdiction;

  



  

(iii)  The Transfer of a Membership Interest in accordance with
this Article VIII shall entitle the transferee only to receive the
distributions, return of contributions and allocations with respect to such
Membership Interest and not to any other rights of a Member, except as
provided in Section 8.1(d) and Section 11.12 and except that Permitted
Transferees in Permitted Affiliate Transfers and transferees of the Silver
Member (or any of its Affiliates) in Transfers pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
shall have and be entitled to exercise all other rights with respect to such
Membership Interest. For the avoidance of doubt, any and all transferees
shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement;

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(iv)  The transferor and transferee of any Member's or Preferred
Holder's Membership Interest shall be jointly and severally obligated to
reimburse the Company for all reasonable expenses (including any transfer
taxes and attorneys' fees and expenses) of any Transfer or proposed Transfer
of a Member's or Preferred Holder's Membership Interest, whether or not
consummated. The transferee of any Membership Interest shall be treated as
having made all of the capital contributions made by, and received all of the
allocations and distributions received by, the transferor of such Membership
Interest in respect of such Interest.

  



  

(v)  The Transfer of a Member's Membership Interest in
accordance with this Article VIII shall only become valid following delivery
of written notice thereof to the Company and the Board of Directors.

  



   Section 8.3| Issuance of Additional Interests in the Company. 
---|--- 
  



  

At any time after the Effective Date, subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including Section 6.19 and Section 6.20), the Company may, upon unanimous
approval of the Board of Directors, cause the Company to issue additional
Membership Interests (herein referred to as an " _Additional Interest_ ") in
the Company to, and admit as a member in the Company (or as a Preferred
Holder), any Person in exchange for the contribution to the Company by such
Person of development or other venture opportunities, interests in
development or other venture opportunities, regional shopping center
developments, interests in regional shopping center developments, cash, cash
equivalents or other assets. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including
Section 6.19 and Section 6.20), the Board of Directors shall be authorized on
behalf of each of the Members to amend this Agreement solely to reflect the
admission of an additional member and the corresponding reduction in the
Percentage Interests of the Members, if any.

  



   Section 8.4| Exchange Rights. 
---|--- 
  



  

(a)   _Terms of Exchange Right_.

  



  

(i)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Section 8.4 and the last sentence of Section 8.1(c), at any time, and
from time to time, following the expiration of the Lockout Period, subject to
obtaining the prior written consent of the Titanium Family Designee, the
Titanium Family Group and any Family Transferees shall have the right to
transfer to the Company any or all Common Units owned by the Titanium Family
Group (or any Family Transferee), but, with respect to any Exchange, no
less than a number of Common Units equal to ten percent (10%) of the Common
Units owned by the Titanium Family Group as of the Effective Date (subject to
any adjustment necessary to account for any split, dividend, distribution,
combination, reclassification or similar event, in each case, in respect of
the Common Units) (unless all of the Common Units owned by the Titanium Family
Group and any Family Transferees are being Exchanged, in which case the
foregoing limitation shall not apply), in exchange for, at the election of
the Titanium Family Designee, (x) a number of Silver OP Units, (y) cash, or
(z) a mix of Silver OP Units and cash, in each case, determined pursuant to
this Section 8.4, which the Company shall pay to such Exchanging Member(s) in
respect of such transfer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
and only if the Titanium Family Group and any Family Transferees submit an
Exchange Notice for a Total Titanium Exchange, Silver OP shall have the option
to modify the Per Unit Consideration Election set forth therein to make the
Silver Cash Consideration Percentage equal to 50% and the Silver OP Unit
Consideration Percentage equal to 50% (for example, if the Exchanging Members
elect, pursuant to such Exchange Notice, to receive cash as consideration for
all of such Exchange and Silver OP exercises its option to modify such
election as set forth in this sentence, the Exchanging Members shall receive
50% of the consideration for such Exchange in cash and 50% of the
consideration for such Exchange in Silver OP Units); _provided_ that the
Titanium Family Designee shall only be permitted to elect to receive Silver OP
Units, and the Silver Member shall only be permitted to modify the Per Unit
Consideration Election, in each case if the Silver OP Units to be received in
such Exchange are redeemable or exchangeable for Equity Shares on a one-for-
one basis and the Equity Shares are then listed for trading on a national
securities exchange.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(ii)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Section 8.4 and the last sentence of Section 8.1(c), by delivering
written notice (a " _Call Exchange Notice_ ") (which notice may not be revoked
once delivered) to the Titanium Family Designee during (x) the ninety (90)
day period immediately following the date on which a Qualified Expert
issues a written decision (the " _Triggering Decision_ ") in which the Silver
Member is designated by such Qualified Expert as the predominately prevailing
party with respect to any Deadlock where the Deadlock Notice was delivered
after January 1, 2021 (and provided that a Call Exchange Notice may only be
delivered pursuant to this clause (x) if (A) a Qualified Expert has
also, within the eighteen (18) month period immediately preceding the date
the Deadlock Notice was delivered with respect to the Triggering Decision,
issued a written decision (the " _Prior Decision_ ") in which the Silver
Member is designated by such Qualified Expert as the predominately prevailing
party with respect to a different Deadlock where the Deadlock Notice was
delivered after January 1, 2021 and (B) at least one of the Triggering
Decision or the Prior Decision was a decision with respect to a
Deadlock where the Deadlock Notice was delivered by the Titanium Family
Designee) or (y) the period from and after the first date on which the
Titanium Family Group and the Family Transferees hold no Common Units, the
Silver Member shall have the right (the " _Silver Call Right_ ") to cause the
Titanium Family Group, any Family Transferees and all other Members (other
than the Silver Member) to transfer to the Company all Common Units owned by
them (in which case all such Common Units shall be deemed to be
Exchanged Units and the Titanium Family Group, Family Transferees and such
other Members shall be deemed to be the Exchanging Members), in exchange for,
at the election of the Silver Member, (x) a number of Silver OP Units, (y)
cash, or (z) a mix of Silver OP Units and cash, in each case, determined
pursuant to this Section 8.4, which the Company shall pay to such Exchanging
Member(s) in respect of such transfer; _provided_ , that the Titanium Family
Designee shall have the option to modify the Per Unit Consideration Election
set forth in the Call Exchange Notice (by delivering written notice of such
modification to the Silver Member within thirty (30) days of the delivery of
the Call Exchange Notice) to make the Silver Cash Consideration Percentage
equal to 50% and the Silver OP Unit Consideration Percentage equal to 50%
(for example, if the Silver Member elects, pursuant to such Call Exchange
Notice, to pay cash as consideration for all of such Exchange and the
Titanium Family Designee exercises its option to modify such election as set
forth in this sentence, the Exchanging Members shall receive 50% of the
consideration for such Exchange in cash and 50% of the consideration for such
Exchange in Silver OP Units); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Silver Member
shall only be permitted to elect to deliver Silver OP Units, and the Titanium
Family Designee shall only be permitted to modify the Per Unit Consideration
Election, in each case if the Silver OP Units to be received in such Exchange
are redeemable or exchangeable for Equity Shares on a one-for-one basis and
the Equity Shares are then listed for trading on a national securities
exchange.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(iii)  On or prior to each Exchange Date, Silver Parent and Silver
OP shall contribute or cause to be contributed to the Company, as a capital
contribution, sufficient Silver OP Units or cash to satisfy all of the
Company's obligations set forth in this Section 8.4, and the Company shall
provide as consideration for such contribution a number of Common Units equal
to the number of Common Units subject to the applicable Exchange in respect
of which such contribution was made; provided that, in the case of an
election to receive Silver OP Units, Silver OP may, in its discretion, on or
before the Exchange Date, by so notifying the Exchanging Member in writing no
later than the Exchange Date, elect to purchase the Common Units being
Exchanged by such Exchanging Member from the Exchanging Member in exchange
for Silver OP Units in the amount of the Per Unit Consideration Election for
each Common Unit, and if Silver OP so elects, the Company no longer has any
obligations pursuant to this Section 8.4 with respect to such Exchange. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Exchange for Silver OP Units
shall be treated as a contribution by the Exchanging Member of Common Units
to Silver OP in exchange for Silver OP Units within the meaning of Section 721
of the Code.

  



  

(b)   _Delivery of Exchange Notices_. Subject to Section 8.4(c),
the Titanium Family Designee may deliver written notice (which notice may be
revoked at any time (other than an Exchange Notice with respect to a Total
Titanium Exchange, as described in the last sentence of Section 8.4(c))) to
the Company (copying Silver Parent and Silver OP) (an " _Exchange Notice_
"): (i) specifying (A) the name of the member(s) of the Titanium Family Group
or Family Transferee(s) (if any) participating in the Exchange (each, an "
_Exchanging Member_ "), (B) the number of Exchangeable Units to be exchanged
by each such Exchanging Member (the " _Exchanged Units_ ") and (C) the
Exchanging Members' selection of the type of Per Unit Consideration Election
to be received for each Exchangeable Unit (for the avoidance of doubt, such
Per Unit Consideration Election may be in the form of Silver OP Units, cash
or a combination thereof and shall be the same for each Exchanged Unit
subject to the same Exchange Notice) and (ii) containing representations and
warranties by each such Exchanging Member that (A) such Person is the legal
owner of the applicable Exchanged Units and that upon the transfer of the
applicable Exchanged Units to the Company, all right, title and interest in
such Exchanged Units will vest in the Company, free and clear of all
liens, (B) the documentation related to the Exchange is duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such Person, (C) all consents and approvals
required by such Person's governing documents, if any, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by such Exchange Notice have been obtained or will
be obtained prior to the applicable Exchange Date, (D) the documentation
related to the Exchange is legal, valid and binding on such Person and is
enforceable in accordance with its terms and (E) solely to the extent Silver
OP Units are to be provided in such Exchange, other customary representations
and warranties reasonably requested by Silver Parent to confirm that an
exception from registration for the Silver OP Units being issued is available.
For the avoidance of doubt, any portion of the Exchangeable Units whose
Exchange is being requested by such Exchange Notice but are not exchanged due
to exceeding the limitations set forth in Section 8.4(c), may be submitted on
a new Exchange Notice at a subsequent date on which such portion of the
Exchangeable Units whose Exchange is being requested no longer exceed such
limitations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Exchange
Notice shall be valid unless accompanied by the written consent of the
Titanium Family Designee that such Exchange Notice may be submitted. The
Titanium Family Designee may not deliver an Exchange Notice following its
delivery of an Exchange Notice for a Total Titanium Exchange or the delivery
by the Silver Member of a Call Exchange Notice.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(c)   _Limitations on Exchanges_. Except as otherwise agreed in
writing by Silver Parent and an Exchanging Member and except as provided in
the last sentence of this Section 8.4(c) with respect to a Total Titanium
Exchange, Exchanging Members shall not be permitted to Exchange a number of
Exchangeable Units pursuant to this Agreement in excess of the amount
determined as set forth under the heading "Amount" in the table below (which
amount is expressed as a percentage of the Common Units owned by the Titanium
Family Group as of the Effective Date (subject to any adjustment necessary to
account for any split, dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification
or similar event, in each case, in respect of the Common Units)). If any
Exchange Notice is revoked, then no subsequent Exchange Notice may be
submitted until the expiration of a one-year period following the delivery of
the Exchange Notice that was revoked.

  



     _Period_   | _Amount_ 
---|--- 
   At any time following the two (2)-year anniversary of the Effective
Date  | Up to 20% 
   At any time following the three (3)-year anniversary of the Effective
Date  | Up to 40% (inclusive of any prior Exchanges) 
   At any time following the four (4)-year anniversary of the Effective
Date  | Up to 60% (inclusive of any prior Exchanges) 
   At any time following the five (5)-year anniversary of the Effective
Date  | Up to 80% (inclusive of any prior Exchanges) 
   At any time following the six (6)-year anniversary of the Effective
Date  | Up to 100% (inclusive of any prior Exchanges) 
  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 8.4(f)(v), from the two
(2)-year anniversary of the Effective Date until the three (3)-year
anniversary of the Effective Date ( _i.e._ , between 24-36 months after the
Effective Date), the Titanium Family Designee may submit an Exchange Notice
(which Exchange Notice shall be irrevocable) with respect to 100% of the
Common Units owned by the Titanium Family Group and the Family Transferees
(such an Exchange, a " _Total Titanium Exchange_ ").

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

(d)   _Exchange of Units_. On the Exchange Date, the Company
(or, if applicable, Silver OP) shall deliver to each Exchanging Member the
Per Unit Consideration Election for each Common Unit being Exchanged by such
Exchanging Member as provided herein and each Exchanging Member shall deliver
to Silver OP (or its designee) all of its Common Units being Exchanged, free
and clear of all liens.

  



  

(e)   _Determination of Total Equity Value_. For purposes of
calculating the Exchange Price, the " _Total Equity Value_ " shall be
determined, as of any Exchange Notice Date, in accordance with the provisions
of Exhibit L.

  



  

(f)   _Closing Procedures; Other Provisions_.

  



  

(i)   _Exchange Date_. Subject to Section 8.4(g) and Section
8.4(f)(v), the closing of any Exchange shall occur, and the Exchanging
Members, the Company, Silver Parent and Silver OP shall cause the closing of
any Exchange to occur, as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant
Exchange Notice Date (but not to be fewer than ten (10) Days or to exceed
thirty (30) Days following the Exchange Notice Date) (the date on which the
closing of any such Exchange occurs, the " _Exchange Date_ ");  _provided_
that, in the event that either the FFO Valuation or the Fair Market Value has
not been finally determined by such date, then the closing of the Exchange
(and the Exchange Date) shall occur within five (5) Business Days following
the final determination of both the FFO Valuation and the Fair Market Value.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary,
but subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.4 regarding the
rescission of Exchange Notices, an Exchanging Member shall have the right, in
its sole discretion, to rescind any Exchange Notice (other than an Exchange
Notice with respect to a Total Titanium Exchange, as described in the last
sentence of Section 8.4(c), which may not be rescinded) prior to the closing
of the applicable Exchange and not consummate the closing of such Exchange,
even after any Total Equity Value has been finally determined.

  



  

(ii)   _Location_. On the Exchange Date, the Exchanging
Member(s), the Company, Silver Parent and Silver OP shall effect the closing
(an " _Exchange Closing_ ") of the transactions contemplated by this Section
8.4 at the offices of the Company in the manner set forth in this Section
8.4(f) or at such other time, at such other place and in such other manner as
the Titanium Family Designee, Silver Parent and Silver OP, shall mutually
agree in writing.

  



  

(iii)   _Closing Deliveries_. At the Exchange Closing, payment of
the Per Unit Consideration Election shall be accompanied by customary
instruments of transfer and assignment with respect to each Common Unit being
Exchanged (which shall include, with respect to any Exchange pursuant to a
Call Exchange Notice, representations and warranties by each such Exchanging
Member that (A) such Person is the legal owner of the applicable Exchanged
Units and that upon the transfer of the applicable Exchanged Units to the
Company, all right, title and interest in such Exchanged Units will vest in
the Company, free and clear of all liens, (B) the documentation related to
the Exchange is duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Person, (C)
all consents and approvals required by such Person's governing documents, if
any, to consummate the transactions contemplated by such Exchange Notice have
been obtained or will be obtained prior to the applicable Exchange Date, (D)
the documentation related to the Exchange is legal, valid and binding on such
Person and is enforceable in accordance with its terms and (E) solely to the
extent Silver OP Units are to be provided in such Exchange, other customary
representations and warranties reasonably requested by Silver Parent to
confirm that an exception from registration for the Silver OP Units being
issued is available) and any applicable Silver OP Units and, if applicable,
to the extent that such Common Units or Silver OP Units are certificated, a
certificate or certificates evidencing such Common Units or Silver OP Units
registered in the name of the Exchanging Member(s); _provided_  that if
Silver OP Units constitute a portion of the Per Unit Consideration Election,
each Exchanging Member shall deliver an executed copy of (x) a joinder to the
Silver OP Partnership Agreement to Silver OP, which joinder shall follow
Silver OP's customary form and (y) a voting agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit M.

  



  

   

81

 



    



  

(iv)   _Term of Exchange Rights_. The rights of the parties with
respect to Exchanges pursuant to this Section 8.4 (the  " _Exchange Rights_
") shall remain in effect, subject to the terms of this Agreement, throughout
the existence of the Company, subject to the last sentence of Section 8.1(c).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
provisions of Section 8.2(b) shall restrict or apply to any Exchange.

  



  

(v)   _Total Titanium Exchange_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the case of a Total Titanium Exchange, the
Silver Member may elect to modify the timing, and only the timing, of such
Total Titanium Exchange so that only fifty percent (50%) of the Common Units
subject to such Total Titanium Exchange will be Exchanged at the Exchange
Closing (the " _Initial Total Titanium Exchange Closing_ ") and the remaining
fifty percent (50%) of such Common Units will be Exchanged one Day prior to
the one-year anniversary of the Initial Total Titanium Exchange Closing (or
earlier, at the Silver Member's election, on ten (10) Days' prior written
notice to the Titanium Family Designee) (the " _Second Total Titanium Exchange
Closing_ "), with the provisions of Section 8.4(a)(iii), Section 8.4(d),
Section 8.4(g) and this Section 8.4(f) (other than Section
8.4(f)(i)) applying to the Second Total Titanium Exchange Closing _mutatis
mutandis_. The Common Units Exchanged at the Second Total Titanium Exchange
Closing will be entitled to the same Per Unit Consideration Election as the
Common Units Exchanged at the Initial Total Titanium Exchange Closing. By way
of example and for the avoidance of doubt, if the Per Unit Consideration
Election paid at the Initial Total Titanium Exchange Closing is $10 in cash
and 2 Silver OP Units, the Per Unit Consideration Election paid at the Second
Total Titanium Exchange Closing will be $10 in cash and 2 Silver OP Units. For
the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, during the period until they are Exchanged at the Second Total
Titanium Exchange Closing, the Common Units that have not yet been Exchanged
pursuant to this Section 8.4(f)(v) shall continue to be outstanding
Common Units for all purposes of this Agreement, including with respect to
receiving distributions, which shall be distributed to each Member during
such period at the rate contemplated by the Annual Distribution Policy in
effect immediately prior to the Initial Total Titanium Exchange Closing,
without giving effect to any Distribution Limitation Event.

  



  

(g)   _Cooperation; Consents_. Each of the Company, the
Exchanging Members, Silver Parent and Silver OP shall cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts to effect and consummate, in accordance with this
Agreement, any Exchange, including to obtain any necessary third party
consents and regulatory approvals, in connection with or as a result of any
Exchange (it being understood and agreed that no such consent shall be a
condition to the closing of any Exchange); _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 8.4, if the Company, any Exchanging
Member, Silver Parent or Silver OP is prohibited by law (including by reason
of an injunction), the consequence of violation of which would be other than
_de minimis_ to Silver Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees, from consummating any Exchange
until approval is obtained, or any applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act (as defined in the Merger Agreement) expires, the Company, any Exchanging
Member, Silver Parent and Silver OP shall not be required to consummate such
Exchange until the date that is five (5) Business Days after such approval is
obtained or expiration occurs, as applicable.

---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  For so long as Silver Parent has any equity securities
listed for trading on a national securities exchange, Silver Parent agrees
that, upon the request of the Titanium Family Designee, made at any time
following delivery of an Exchange Notice, Silver Parent shall, solely to the
extent permitted by applicable law, if it has not already done so, within
ninety (90) Days thereafter file a "shelf" registration statement or a
prospectus supplement to an existing "automatic shelf"
registration statement, on an appropriate form pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act or any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC (such
registration statement, a " _Shelf Registration_ ") and in compliance with
applicable securities laws, with respect to the sale of Registrable
Securities (as defined below) by the Shelf Rights Holders, the sale of which
is reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross proceeds of not less than
ten million Dollars ($10,000,000), in brokerage or dealer transactions or
block sales through an underwriter or underwriters or any other transactions
that may or may not involve an underwritten public offering. Silver Parent
shall have the Shelf Registration declared effective as soon as practicable
after such filing and, for so long as Silver Parent has any equity securities
listed on a national securities exchange, shall use reasonable best
efforts to keep such Shelf Registration continuously effective following the
date on which such Shelf Registration is declared effective for so long as
any Registrable Securities are outstanding. For so long as Silver Parent has
equity securities listed on a national securities exchange, Silver Parent
further agrees, if necessary, to supplement (including with any free writing
prospectus) or make amendments to the Shelf Registration, if required by the
registration form used by Silver Parent for the Shelf Registration or by the
instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act or
the rules and regulations thereunder. With respect to any Shelf Registration,
or any supplement or amendment thereto, Silver Parent shall (i) furnish to the
Titanium Family Designee copies of all documents proposed to be filed at
least three (3) Business Days prior to it being used or filed with the SEC in
accordance with this Section 8.5 and (ii) give reasonable consideration to the
inclusion in such documents of any comments reasonably and timely made by the
Titanium Family Designee and its advisors (including legal counsel), subject
to the Titanium Family Group providing customary representations and
warranties regarding the accuracy of any information provided by it regarding
the Titanium Family Group; _provided_ that Silver Parent shall include in such
documents any such comments that are necessary to correct an untrue statement
of a material fact or an omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the
light of the circumstances then existing regarding a Shelf Rights Holder, its
beneficial ownership of equity in Silver Parent, its distribution plans and
similar related information. For so long as Silver Parent has equity
securities listed for trading on a national securities exchange, Silver Parent
also shall use reasonable best efforts to list such Registrable Securities on
any exchange on which the Equity Shares are trading at the time of such
Shelf Registration (if such Registrable Securities are not already so listed
and if such listing is then permitted under the rules of such exchange) to
the extent required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Silver Parent
determines in good faith that it would be disadvantageous in any material
respect to Silver Parent and its stockholders for any such Shelf Registration
to be amended or supplemented, Silver Parent may defer such amending or
supplementing of such Shelf Registration for not more than ninety (90)
Days (and not more than a total of one hundred and twenty (120) Days in any
twelve (12) month period) and in such event the Shelf Rights Holder shall be
required to discontinue disposition of any Registrable Securities covered by
such Shelf Registration during such period. Silver Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with a Shelf Rights Holder in
respect of any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration, including using commercially reasonable efforts to enter into
customary underwriting or other agreements in connection therewith and
request its auditors to provide customary comfort letters and legal advisors
to provide customary legal opinions in connection therewith.

(b)  The securities entitled to the benefits of this Section
8.5 are the Equity Shares that may be issued from time to time upon the
exchange or redemption of Silver OP Units that have been received in an
Exchange pursuant to Section 8.4 (the " _Registrable Securities_ ") but, with
respect to any particular Registrable Security, only so long as it continues
to be a Registrable Security. For the purposes of this Agreement, a security
that was at one time a Registrable Security shall cease to be a
Registrable Security when (i) such security has been effectively registered
under the Securities Act, and either (A) the registration statement with
respect thereto has remained continuously effective for one hundred eighty
(180) Days or (B) such security has been disposed of pursuant to such
registration statement, (ii) such security is or can be immediately sold to
the public in reliance on Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in force)
under the Securities Act without any restriction or limitation, or (iii) such
security has ceased to be outstanding or owned by a Shelf Rights Holder.

  



  

(c)  Silver Parent shall pay all expenses incident to the Shelf
Registration, including (i) all SEC, stock exchange and National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. registration, filing and listing fees, (ii) all
fees and expenses incurred in complying with securities or "blue sky" laws
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with
"blue sky" qualifications of the Registrable Securities), (iii) all printing,
messenger and delivery expenses, (iv) all fees and disbursements of Silver
Parent's independent public accountants and counsel and (v) all fees and
expenses of any special experts retained by Silver Parent in connection with
the Shelf Registration pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.5, regardless
of whether such Shelf Registration becomes effective, unless such Shelf
Registration fails to become effective as a result of the fault of the Shelf
Rights Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that Silver Parent shall not pay the
costs and expenses of any Shelf Rights Holder relating to brokerage or dealer
fees, transfer taxes or the fees or expenses of any counsel's accountants or
other representatives retained by the Shelf Rights Holders.

IX. 
  
 WITHHOLDING AND DOCUMENTATION.

  



   Section 9.1| Withholding. 
---|--- 
  



  

If any local, state, federal, or foreign law or regulation requires the
Company to withhold tax attributable to allocations of Profits or items of
the foregoing or distributions to a Member or Preferred Holder (all such
amounts being herein referred to collectively as the " _Withholding Tax_ "),
(i) any Withholding Tax shall be withheld from cash otherwise currently
distributable to such Member or Preferred Holder pursuant to Section 5.2 or
Section 10.5(a) and (ii) to the extent cash is not distributable to such
Member or Preferred Holder within the taxable period as to which such
withholding is required ( _i.e._ , quarterly, semi-annually, or annually),
such Member or Preferred Holder shall make a payment to the Company in readily
available funds within ten (10) Days after written notice from the Company of
such Member's or Preferred Holder's Withholding Tax. In the event a Member or
Preferred Holder fails to timely remit the Withholding Tax, the Failure to
Comply Remedies shall apply.

  



  

For the purpose of determining a Member's or Preferred Holder's Capital
Account, any amount of cash otherwise distributable to a Member or Preferred
Holder that is retained by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be
treated as if such cash had been actually distributed to such Member or
Preferred Holder and remitted to the Company. Any amount remitted to the
Company for payment of a Tax Loan made by the Company (or its Affiliate) shall
be treated as a payment to the Company (or its Affiliate) as a lender and
from the Member or Preferred Holder as a borrower. Any amount of cash deemed
remitted or actually remitted to the Company by a Member or Preferred Holder
pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall not constitute a capital contribution
and shall not increase a Member's or Preferred Holder's Capital Account.

  



  

The provisions of this Section 9.1 shall survive a Member's membership in the
Company, a Preferred Holder's ownership of Preferred Units and the
dissolution, liquidation, winding up, and termination of the Company, and for
purposes of this Section 9.1, the Company shall be treated as continuing in
existence. The Company may pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may
have against a Member or Preferred Holder under this Section 9.1, including
instituting a lawsuit to collect such reimbursement with interest calculated
at the Interest Rate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
provisions of this Section 9.1 shall be binding on the Company's successors
and assigns.

  



   Section 9.2| Documentation. 
---|--- 
  



  

Each Member and Preferred Holder agrees to furnish the Company with any
representations, forms, or information, including an updated Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN or equivalent certificate, as applicable, as
shall reasonably be requested by the Company from time to time (i) to assist
the Company in determining the extent of, and in fulfilling, its withholding,
reporting, or other tax obligations, including any obligations under the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or equivalent law of any other
jurisdiction, (ii) as will permit distributions or allocations of income made
to or by the Company to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of
withholding, (iii) to reduce the amount of tax borne by the Company, or (iv)
that is necessary to ensure compliance with any laws or regulations
applicable to the Company or its business, including the laws of any foreign
jurisdiction affecting the ability of the Company to claim the benefit of an
income tax treaty with such jurisdiction. Each Member and Preferred
Holder (A) represents and warrants to the Company that such information and
forms furnished by such Person are and at all times shall be true, correct,
and complete and (B) agrees to promptly update any such information or forms
(x) if at any time such Person becomes aware that such previously provided
information or forms are no longer true, correct, and complete or (y)
if requested to do so by the Company.

   | Section 10.3| Bankruptcy of a Member.

---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  Subject to Section 18-803(a) of the Act, in the event of

businesses similar to those of the Company and has substantial experience in
the purchase and sale of businesses. The costs of winding up shall be borne

86

 



    



  

(b)  Upon dissolution of the Company and until the filing of a
certificate of cancellation as provided in Section 18-203 of the Act, the
Liquidating Agent may, in the name of, and for and on behalf of, the Company,

criminal or administrative, settle and close the Company's business, dispose
of and convey the Company's property or sell any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, discharge or make reasonable provision for the
Company's liabilities, and distribute, subject to the terms of any Preferred
Unit Designation, to the Members in accordance with Section 10.5 and without
imposing any liability on the Liquidating Agent, all without affecting the
liability of Members and without imposing any liability on the Liquidating
Agent.

  



  

(c)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Members shall continue to share distributions and allocations during the
period of liquidation in the same manner as before the dissolution.

  



  

(d)  A reasonable time period shall be allowed for the orderly
winding up and liquidation of the assets of the Company and the discharge of
liabilities to creditors so as to enable the Liquidating Agent to seek to
minimize potential losses upon such liquidation;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Liquidating Agent shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of
the Company and make final distributions as provided herein and in the Act.
As promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final

by a recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Company's assets,
liabilities and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which
the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable.

   | Section 10.5| Distribution of Assets. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a)  As soon as practicable upon dissolution of the Company,
subject to the terms of any Preferred Unit Designation, the assets of the
Company (or liquidation proceeds) shall be distributed in the following manner
and order of priority (and ratably within each level of priority):

  



  

(i)  first, to creditors of the Company, including Members and
Preferred Holders who are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by
law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the Company (whether by payment or the
making of reasonable provision for payment thereof) other than liabilities
for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and liabilities for
distributions under Article V; and

  



  

(ii)  second, to the Members and Preferred Holders in accordance
with and in proportion to the positive balances in their Capital Accounts,
after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, allocations and
adjustments for all periods.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(b)  It is the intention of the parties that final Capital
Account balances of the Members and Preferred Holders in respect of their
Membership Interests will permit liquidating distributions to be made (after
the satisfaction of the liabilities, debts and obligations of the Company to
creditors pursuant to Section 10.5(a)(i)) _pro rata_ in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests and, in the case of Preferred Holders, in
accordance with the economic entitlement of the Preferred Units. The
allocations and distributions provided for in this Agreement are intended to
result in the Capital Account of each Member and Preferred Holder in respect
of its Membership Interest immediately prior to the distribution of the
Company's assets pursuant to this Section 10.5(b) (after the satisfaction of
the liabilities, debts and obligations of the Company to creditors
pursuant to Section 10.5(a)(i)) being equal to the amount that would be
distributable to such Member in accordance with its Percentage Interest and,
in the case of Preferred Holders, in accordance with the economic entitlement
of the Preferred Units. The Company is authorized, to the extent possible, to
make appropriate adjustments to the allocation of items of income, gain, loss
and deduction as necessary to cause the amount of each Member's and Preferred
Holder's Capital Account in respect of its Membership Interest immediately
prior to the distribution of the Company's assets pursuant to this Section
10.5 (after the satisfaction of the obligations of the Company to creditors
pursuant to Section 10.5(a)(i)) to equal the amount that would be
distributable to such Member in respect of its Membership Interest in
accordance with its Percentage Interest and, in the case of Preferred
Holders, in accordance with the economic entitlement of their Preferred
Units.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if any Member which, by written notice to the Company, in its sole
discretion, elects to be bound by this Section 10.5(c) shall have a negative
balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Company or upon
liquidation of its Membership Interest, after giving effect to the allocation
of all Profits, Losses, gain or loss and items of the foregoing under Section
5.1 and all distributions to the Members pursuant to Section 5.2 in each case
for all Company Fiscal Years through and including the Company Fiscal Year of
such liquidation, such Member shall be obligated to make an additional
capital contribution to the Company by the end of the Company Fiscal Year of
liquidation (or, if later, within ninety (90) Days after the date of such
liquidation), in an amount sufficient to eliminate the negative balance in
its Capital Account. For purposes of this Section 10.5(c), "liquidation" shall
be as defined in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) _(g)_.

  



  

(d)  In connection with a liquidation of a Member's or
Preferred Holder's interest in the Company within the meaning of Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( _g_ ) that is not in connection with a liquidation
of the Company, distributions to such Member or Preferred Holder shall be
made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) _(b)(2)_.

  



   Section 10.6| Cancellation of Certificates. 
---|--- 
  



  

All documents and records of the Company, including all financial records,
vouchers, canceled checks and bank statements, shall be delivered to the
Silver Member upon dissolution of the Company. The Silver Member shall retain
such documents and records for a period of not less than seven (7) years and
shall afford access to such documents and records to each Member (or former
Member), except and to the extent that the Silver Member believes, in its
reasonable good faith judgment, that doing so would (i) result in the loss of
attorney-client, work product or other privilege, (ii) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligations
of the Silver Member or its Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality to
any third party, or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any such contract
to which the Silver Member or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (iii)
breach, contravene or violate any applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Silver Member shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not violate the foregoing.

   Section 10.7| Disposition of Documents and Records.

After the affairs of the Company have been wound up, the property and assets
of the Company have been liquidated, and the proceeds thereof have been
applied and distributed as provided in Section 10.4(a) and the Company has
been terminated, appropriate Persons shall, if required by law, execute and
file an assumed or fictitious name certificate (or a similar writing) to
effect the cancellation, of record, of the certificate(s) of Members or
Preferred Holders of the Company (or similar writing), and the Membership
Interest Certificates.

the respective rights and obligations hereunder shall be enforceable by
specific performance, injunction, or other equitable remedy, but nothing
