assumed award shall be determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of

accelerated or otherwise affected as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions) as applied to such RFMD Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each assumed RFMD Option shall be determined by multiplying (A) the
number of shares of RFMD Common Stock subject to such RFMD Option by (B) the
RFMD Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole
share, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each assumed RFMD Option shall be determined by
dividing (A) the per share exercise price for the shares of RFMD Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such RFMD Option, by (B) the RFMD Exchange
Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent.

 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each RFMD RSU and RFMD PSU with
respect to which shares of RFMD Common Stock remain unvested or unissued as

and other conditions in effect on such date with respect to such award,

6\.  such holders TriQuint Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 2.9(a))
or non-certificated shares of TriQuint Common Stock represented by book entry

material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under each
RFMD Employee Plan, and each RFMD Employee Plan has been established,

RFMD Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has obtained a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under
the Code or is a prototype or volume submitter plan entitled,
under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the favorable opinion or advisory
letter issued to the sponsor of such prototype or volume submitter plan. To
the Knowledge of RFMD, no event has occurred and no circumstance or condition
exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of
any such RFMD Employee Plan. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not
otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any
RFMD Employee Plan. Each RFMD Employee Plan (other than any RFMD Employee Plan
to be terminated prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this
Agreement) can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Closing in accordance with its terms, without liability to TriQuint, any of
the RFMD Corporations or any RFMD Affiliate (other than any liability for
ordinary administration expenses and benefits accrued as of the date of
amendment, termination or discontinuance). There are no audits or inquiries
pending or, to the Knowledge of RFMD, threatened by the IRS, the DOL or any
other Governmental Body with respect to any RFMD Employee Plan. None of the
RFMD Corporations, and no RFMD Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any material
penalty or Tax with respect to any RFMD Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of
ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any material penalty
or Tax under applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any RFMD Employee
Plan or RFMD Employee Agreement. Each of the RFMD Corporations and RFMD
Affiliates has made all contributions and other payments required by and due

performance of any RFMD Employee Agreement or RFMD Employee Plan could

Time pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code. All RFMD Foreign Plans
required to have been approved by any Governmental Body have been so approved,
no such approval has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of RFMD, has
revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred to the Knowledge of
RFMD since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor
relating to any such RFMD Foreign Plan that would reasonably be expected to
materially affect any such approval relating thereto or materially increase
the costs relating thereto.

(f) None of the RFMD Corporations, and no RFMD Affiliate, has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any: (i) employee
benefit plan that is (or was) subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or

of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in Section
413(c) of the Code. No RFMD Employee Plan is or has been funded by, associated
with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within

and no RFMD Affiliate, has ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in or contributed to any RFMD Pension Plan in which stock of any
of the RFMD Corporations or any RFMD Affiliate is or was held as a plan
asset. Except as set forth in Part 3.16(f) of the RFMD Disclosure Schedule,
the fair market value of the assets of each funded RFMD Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any RFMD Foreign Plan funded through insurance,
or the book reserve established for any RFMD Foreign Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the
accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former
participants in such RFMD Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently

 



26\.  used to determine employer contributions to and obligations under such RFMD
Foreign Plan, and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. There are no
material liabilities of the RFMD Corporations with respect to any RFMD
Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial
statements of RFMD in accordance with GAAP.

 

(g) Except as set forth in Part 3.16(g) of the RFMD Disclosure Schedule, none
of the RFMD Corporations, and no RFMD Affiliate, maintains, sponsors or
contributes to any RFMD Employee Plan that is a "group health plan," as
defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, and that is, in whole or in part,
self-funded or self-insured. No RFMD Employee Plan provides (except at no
cost to the RFMD Corporations or any RFMD Affiliate), or reflects or
represents any liability of any of the RFMD Corporations or any RFMD Affiliate
to provide, post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination
or retiree health benefits or other post-termination or retiree employee
welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, except (i) as may be required
by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) benefits through the end
of the month of termination of employment, (iii) death benefits attributable
to deaths occurring at or prior to termination of employment, (iv) disability

respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by any
TriQuint Corporation with respect to any material Tax (other than liabilities

which are being contested in good faith by the TriQuint Corporations and with
respect to which reserves for payment have been established on the TriQuint
Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP). There are no liens for material Taxes
upon any of the assets of any of the TriQuint Corporations except liens for
current Taxes not yet due and payable or being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which reserves have been established in

employed, prior to the Closing.

that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

(g) There are no Contracts relating to allocating or sharing of Taxes to which
any TriQuint Corporation is a party (except for customary agreements not
primarily related to Taxes). None of the TriQuint Corporations is liable for
Taxes of any other Person (other than another TriQuint Corporation), or is
currently under any contractual obligation to indemnify any Person with
respect to any amounts of such Persons Taxes or is a party to any Contract
providing for payments by a TriQuint Corporation with respect to any amount of
Taxes of any other Person (in each case, except for customary agreements
not primarily related to Taxes).

"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

4.16 Employee and Labor Matters; Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Except as set forth on Part 4.16(a) of the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule,
the employment of each of the TriQuint Employees (i) in the United States is
terminable by the applicable TriQuint Corporation at will and without material
liability for any severance, termination or similar post-termination payment
or benefit except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii)
outside of the United States can be terminated without material liability for
any severance, termination, pension or similar post-termination payment or
benefits in excess of amounts (including notice pay) strictly required by
applicable Legal Requirements.

(b) Except as set forth on Part 4.16(b)(i) of the TriQuint
Disclosure Schedule, none of the TriQuint Corporations is a party to, or has
a duty to bargain for, any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract
with a labor organization or works council representing any of its employees
and there are no labor organizations or works councils representing,
purporting to represent or, to the Knowledge of TriQuint, seeking to represent
any employees of any of the TriQuint Corporations. Since January 1, 2012,
there has not been any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, job action,
picketing, labor dispute, question concerning representation, union organizing
activity, or any threat thereof, or any similar activity or dispute, affecting
any of the TriQuint Corporations or any of their employees. There is not now
pending, and no Person has threatened to commence, any such strike, slowdown,
work stoppage, lockout, job action, picketing, labor dispute, question
regarding representation or union organizing activity or any similar activity
or dispute. Except as set forth on 4.16(b)(ii) of the TriQuint Disclosure
Schedule, there is no claim or grievance pending or, to the Knowledge of

term disability policy, safety, retaliation, immigration or discrimination
matters involving any TriQuint Associate, including charges of unfair labor
practices or harassment complaints.

 

(c) TriQuint has Made Available to RFMD an accurate and complete list, by
country and as of the date hereof, of each TriQuint Employee Plan and each
TriQuint Employee Agreement. None of the TriQuint Corporations or TriQuint
Affiliates intends, and none of the TriQuint Corporations or TriQuint
Affiliate has committed, to establish or enter into any new TriQuint Employee
Plan or TriQuint Employee Agreement, or to modify any TriQuint Employee Plan
or TriQuint Employee Agreement (except to conform any such TriQuint Employee
Plan or TriQuint Employee Agreement to the requirements of any applicable
Legal Requirements, in each case as previously disclosed to RFMD in writing
or as required by this Agreement).

(d) TriQuint has Made Available to RFMD accurate and complete copies of, to
the extent applicable,: (i) all documents setting forth the terms of each
TriQuint Employee Plan and each TriQuint Employee Agreement, including all
amendments thereto and all related trust documents; (ii) the three most
recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial
statements attached thereto), if any, required under applicable Legal
Requirements in connection with each TriQuint Employee Plan; (iii) if the
TriQuint Employee Plan is subject to the minimum funding standards of Section
302 of ERISA, the most recent annual and periodic accounting of TriQuint
Employee Plan assets, if any; (iv) the most recent summary plan description
together with the summaries of material modifications thereto, if any,
required under ERISA or any similar Legal Requirement with respect to each
TriQuint Employee Plan; (v) all material written Contracts relating to each
TriQuint Employee Plan,

 



46\.  including administrative service agreements and group insurance contracts;
(vi) all discrimination tests required under the Code for each TriQuint
Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for
the three most recent plan years; and (vii) the most recent IRS determination,
opinion or advisory letter issued with respect to each TriQuint Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(e) Each of the TriQuint Corporations and TriQuint Affiliates has performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
each TriQuint Employee Plan, and each TriQuint Employee Plan has been
established, maintained, administered and funded in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Any TriQuint Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter as to
its qualified status under the Code or is a prototype or volume submitter
plan entitled, under applicable IRS guidance, to rely on the favorable opinion
or advisory letter issued to the sponsor of such prototype or volume submitter
plan. To the Knowledge of TriQuint, no event has occurred and no circumstance
or condition exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any such TriQuint Employee Plan. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections
406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA,
has occurred with respect to any TriQuint Employee Plan. Each TriQuint
Employee Plan (other than any TriQuint Employee Plan to be terminated prior to
the Initial Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement) can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its
terms, without liability to TriQuint, any of the TriQuint Corporations or any
TriQuint Affiliate (other than any liability for ordinary administration
expenses and benefits accrued as of the date of amendment, termination or
discontinuance). There are no audits or inquiries pending or, to the Knowledge
of TriQuint, threatened by the IRS, the DOL or any other Governmental Body
with respect to any TriQuint Employee Plan. None of the TriQuint Corporations,
and no TriQuint Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any material penalty or Tax
with respect to any TriQuint Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or
Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any material penalty or Tax
under applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any TriQuint Employee Plan
or TriQuint Employee Agreement. Each of the TriQuint Corporations
and TriQuint Affiliates has made all contributions and other payments
required by and due under the terms of each TriQuint Employee Plan. Neither
the terms nor the performance of any TriQuint Employee Agreement or TriQuint
Employee Plan could reasonably be expected to result in gross income
inclusion after the Initial Effective Time pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(A)
of the Code. All TriQuint Foreign Plans required to have been approved by any
Governmental Body have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked
(or, to the Knowledge of TriQuint, has revocation been threatened) and no
event has occurred to the Knowledge of TriQuint since the date of the most
recent approval or application therefor relating to any such TriQuint Foreign
Plan that would reasonably be expected to materially affect any such approval
relating thereto or materially increase the costs relating thereto.

 

(f) None of the TriQuint Corporations, and no TriQuint Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any:
(i) employee benefit plan that is (or was) subject to Section 302 or Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (ii) "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in
Section 413(c) of the Code. No TriQuint Employee Plan is or has been funded
by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
None of the TriQuint Corporations, and no TriQuint Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any
TriQuint Pension Plan in which stock of any of the TriQuint Corporations or
any TriQuint Affiliate is or was held as a plan asset. Except as set forth on
Part 4.16(f) of the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule, the fair market value of the
assets of each funded TriQuint Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer
for any TriQuint Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve
established for any TriQuint Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is

  



47\.  sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit
obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in such
TriQuint Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to and
obligations under such TriQuint Foreign Plan, and no Contemplated Transaction
will cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations. There are no material liabilities of the TriQuint
Corporations with respect to any TriQuint Employee Plan that are not properly
accrued and reflected in the financial statements of TriQuint in accordance
with GAAP.

 

(g) Except as set forth on Part 4.16(g) of the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule,
none of the TriQuint Corporations, and no TriQuint Affiliate, maintains,
sponsors or contributes to any TriQuint Employee Plan that is a "group health
plan," as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, and that is, in whole or
in part, self-funded or self-insured. No TriQuint Employee Plan provides
(except at no cost to the TriQuint Corporations or any TriQuint Affiliate), or
reflects or represents any liability of any of the TriQuint Corporations or
any TriQuint Affiliate to provide, post-termination or retiree life
insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-
termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason,
except (i) as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements, (ii) benefits through the end of the month of termination of
employment, (iii) death benefits attributable to deaths occurring at or prior
to termination of employment, (iv) disability benefits attributable to
disabilities occurring at or prior to termination of employment, and (v)
conversion rights. Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to
any of the TriQuint Corporations or any TriQuint Affiliate, none of the
TriQuint Corporations nor any TriQuint Affiliate has ever represented,
promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any TriQuint
Associate (either individually or to TriQuint Associates as a group) or any
other Person that such TriQuint Associate(s) or other Person would be
provided with post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or
retiree health benefit or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare
benefits, except (i) to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, (ii) benefits through the end of the month of termination of
employment, (iii) death benefits attributable to deaths occurring at or prior
to termination of employment, (iv) disability benefits attributable to
disabilities occurring at or prior to termination of employment, and (v)
conversion rights.

(h) Except as set forth on Part 4.16(h) of the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions will or could reasonably be expected to (either
alone or upon the occurrence of termination of employment) constitute an
event under any TriQuint Employee Plan, TriQuint Employee Agreement, trust or
loan that will or may result (either alone or in connection with any other
circumstance or event) in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any TriQuint
Associate.

 

(i) Except as set forth in Part 4.16(i) of the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule,
each of the TriQuint Corporations and TriQuint Affiliates: (i) is, and at all
times has been, in compliance in all material respects with any Order or
arbitration award of any court, arbitrator or any Governmental Body respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,
hours or other labor related matters; (ii) has withheld and reported all
amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to be
withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to
TriQuint Associates; (iii) is not liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes
or any interest or penalty for failure to comply with the Legal Requirements
applicable of the foregoing; and (iv) is not liable for any payment to any
trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any
Governmental Body with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social
security, social charges or other benefits or obligations for TriQuint
Associates (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practice).

 



48\. (j) Except as set forth on Part 4.16(j) of the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule,
there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
TriQuint Associate, and no payments have been made or will be made to any
TriQuint Associate, that, considered individually or considered collectively
with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or could reasonably be
expected to, be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or indirectly to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m)
of the Code (or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws). No
TriQuint Corporation is a party to or has any obligation under any Contract to
compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of
the Code or for additional taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

(k) Since January 1, 2012, none of the TriQuint Corporations has effectuated a
"plant closing," partial "plant closing," "relocation", "mass layoff" or
"termination" (as defined in the WARN Act or any similar Legal Requirement)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of any of the TriQuint
Corporations.

any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar Contract
to which any such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which
any such party or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced in
accordance with its terms at the request of the other party to this Agreement.

with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, RFMD after consultation with TriQuint
may, or if requested by TriQuint shall, adjourn or postpone the RFMD
Shareholders Meeting: (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is
required by applicable Legal Requirements is timely provided to RFMDs
shareholders; (B) if as of the time for which the RFMD Shareholders Meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of RFMD Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business to be conducted at the RFMD Shareholders Meeting; (C)
if additional time is reasonably required (taking into account the likelihood
of success in light of the ongoing existence of any RFMD Superior Offer) to
solicit proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement; or (D) TriQuint
has postponed or adjourned the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Subject to Section 6.2(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall

(ii) the RFMD Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in
a manner adverse to TriQuint; (iii) neither the RFMD Board nor any committee
thereof shall: (A) fail to

 



63\.  reaffirm the RFMD Board Recommendation, or fail to publicly state that the
Mergers and this Agreement are in the best interest of RFMDs shareholders,
within ten business days after TriQuint requests in writing that such action
be taken; (B) fail to publicly announce, within ten business days after a
tender offer or exchange offer relating to the securities of RFMD shall have
been commenced, a statement disclosing that the RFMD Board recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (C) fail to issue, within ten
business days after an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an RFMD
Corporation is publicly announced, a press release announcing its opposition
to such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) resolve or publicly propose to take any
action described in clauses "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this sentence (each of the
foregoing actions described in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" being referred to
as an "RFMD Change in Recommendation").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.2(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Required RFMD Shareholder Vote, the RFMD Board may effect, or
cause RFMD to effect, as the case may be, an RFMD Change in Recommendation
and, in the case of subclause "(i)" below, terminate this Agreement to enter
into a Contract with respect to an RFMD Superior Offer:

 

(i) if: (A) RFMD has not breached its obligations under Section 5.4(a) or
Section 6.2(b) in connection with the Acquisition Proposal referred to in the
following clause "(B);" (B) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited,
bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to RFMD; (C) the RFMD Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with an independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes an RFMD Superior Offer; (D) the RFMD Board does not effect, or
cause RFMD to effect, an RFMD Change in Recommendation at any time within
five business days after TriQuint receives written notice from RFMD confirming
that the RFMD Board has determined that such Acquisition Proposal is an RFMD
Superior Offer (together with a written summary of RFMD Superior Offer and
setting forth the identity of the Person making such RFMD Superior Offer and
all the material terms and conditions of such RFMD Superior Offer in
reasonable detail) (it being understood and agreed that any revision or
modification in any material respect to such RFMD Superior Offer shall require
a new written notice by RFMD to TriQuint in compliance with this clause "(D)"
and a new matching period under clause "(E)" below, except that such notice
and matching period shall be three business days); (E) during such five
business day period, if requested by TriQuint, RFMD engages in good faith
negotiations, the intent and purpose of which is to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute
an RFMD Superior Offer no longer constitutes an RFMD Superior Offer, so that
the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected; (F) at the end of such
five business day period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn
and continues to constitute an RFMD Superior Offer (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by TriQuint as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G) the RFMD Board
determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such RFMD Superior Offer, the failure to make an
RFMD Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the RFMD Board to RFMDs shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements; or

 

(ii) if: (A) a material development or change in circumstances that is not
related to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an RFMD Corporation, to
the extent such development or change in circumstances is disproportionately
more favorable to the recurring financial condition and results of operations
of RFMD and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, when compared to other
businesses operating in the industries in which RFMD operates, occurs or
arises after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to any RFMD
Corporation or any Representative of any RFMD Corporation nor reasonably
foreseeable to any RFMD

 



64\.  Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (such material development or
change in circumstances being referred to as an "RFMD Intervening Event");
_provided, however,_  that changes in the market price or trading volume of
RFMD Common Stock or the fact that RFMD meets or exceeds internal or published
projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any period shall
not constitute an Intervening Event, except that the underlying causes of
such change or fact shall not be excluded from this clause "(A)"; (B) at least
five business days prior to any meeting of the RFMD Board at which the RFMD
Board will consider whether such RFMD Intervening Event requires the RFMD
Board to effect, or cause RFMD to effect, an RFMD Change in Recommendation,
RFMD provides TriQuint with a written notice specifying the date and time of
such meeting and the reasons for holding such meeting; (C) during such five
business day period, if requested by TriQuint, RFMD engages in good faith
negotiations with TriQuint to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for the RFMD Board to effect, or cause RFMD to effect,
an RFMD Change in Recommendation as a result of such RFMD Intervening Event;
and (D) the RFMD Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with
its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such RFMD Intervening Event, the
failure to make an RFMD Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the RFMD Board to RFMDs shareholders under applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any RFMD Change in Recommendation, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be submitted
to the holders of RFMDs Common Stock at the RFMD Shareholders Meeting for
the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve RFMD of such obligation.

6.3 TriQuint Stockholders Meeting.

 

(a) TriQuint: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
TriQuint Common Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement (the
"TriQuint Stockholders Meeting"); and (ii) shall submit such proposal to such
holders at the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting and, except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, shall not submit any other proposal to such
holders in connection with the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of RFMD. TriQuint in consultation with RFMD shall set a
record date for Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the TriQuint
Stockholders Meeting and shall not change such record date without the prior
written consent of RFMD. The TriQuint Stockholders Meeting shall be held on
the date that (or, to the extent that TriQuint and RFMD agree, as promptly as
practicable after) this Agreement shall have been adopted by RFMDs
shareholders at the RFMD Shareholders Meeting. TriQuint shall ensure that
all proxies solicited in connection with the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting
are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, TriQuint after consultation with RFMD may, or if requested by RFMD
shall, adjourn or postpone the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting: (A) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus that is required by applicable Legal Requirements
is timely provided to TriQuints stockholders; (B) if as of the time for which
the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of TriQuint Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be
conducted at the TriQuint Stockholders Meeting; (C) if additional time is
reasonably required (taking into account the likelihood of success in light
of the ongoing existence of any TriQuint Superior Offer) to solicit proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement; or (D) RFMD has postponed or
adjourned the RFMD Shareholders Meeting.

(b) Subject to Section 6.3(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include a statement to the effect that the TriQuint Board recommends that
TriQuints stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the TriQuint
Stockholders Meeting (the recommendation of the TriQuint Board 

 



65\.  that TriQuints stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement being referred to
as the "TriQuint Board Recommendation"); (ii) the TriQuint Board
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
RFMD; (iii) neither the TriQuint Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A)
fail to reaffirm the TriQuint Board Recommendation, or fail to publicly state
that the Mergers and this Agreement are in the best interest of TriQuints
stockholders, within ten business days after RFMD requests in writing that
such action be taken; (B) fail to publicly announce, within ten business days
after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the securities of TriQuint
shall have been commenced, a statement disclosing that the TriQuint Board
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (C) fail to issue,
within ten business days after an Acquisition Proposal with respect to a
TriQuint Corporation is publicly announced, a press release announcing its

of the foregoing actions described in clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)" being
referred to as a "TriQuint Change in Recommendation").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required TriQuint Stockholder Vote, the TriQuint Board may
effect, or cause TriQuint to effect, as the case may be, a TriQuint Change in
Recommendation and, in the case of subclause "(i)" below, terminate this
Agreement to enter into a Contract with respect to a TriQuint Superior Offer:

 

(i) if: (A) TriQuint has not breached its obligations under Section 5.4(b)
or Section 6.3(b) in connection with the Acquisition Proposal referred to in
the following clause "(B);" (B) after the date of this Agreement, an
unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal is made to TriQuint; (C)
the TriQuint Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting
with an independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a TriQuint Superior Offer; (D) the TriQuint
Board does not effect, or cause TriQuint to effect, a TriQuint Change in
Recommendation at any time within five business days after RFMD receives
written notice from TriQuint confirming that the TriQuint Board has determined
that such Acquisition Proposal is a TriQuint Superior Offer (together with a
written summary of the TriQuint Superior Offer and setting forth the identity
of the Person making such TriQuint Superior Offer and all the material terms
and conditions of such TriQuint Superior Offer in reasonable detail) (it
being understood and agreed that any revision or modification in any material
respect to such TriQuint Superior Offer shall require a new written notice by
TriQuint to RFMD in compliance with this clause "(D)" and a new matching
period under clause "(E)" below, except that such notice and matching period
shall be three business days); (E) during such five business day period, if
requested by RFMD, TriQuint engages in good faith negotiations, the intent
and purpose of which is to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute a TriQuint Superior
Offer no longer constitutes a TriQuint Superior Offer, so that the

(ii) if: (A) a material development or change in circumstances that is not
related to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to a TriQuint Corporation, to
the extent such development or change in circumstances is disproportionately
more favorable to the recurring financial condition and results of operations
of TriQuint and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

 



66\.  when compared to other businesses operating in the industries in which
TriQuint operates, occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was
neither known to any TriQuint Corporation or any Representative of any
TriQuint Corporation nor reasonably foreseeable to any TriQuint Corporation as
of the date of this Agreement (such material development or change in
circumstances being referred to as a "TriQuint Intervening Event");
_provided, however,_ that changes in the market price or trading volume of
TriQuint Common Stock or the fact that TriQuint meets or exceeds internal or
published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any

causes of such change or fact shall not be excluded from this clause "(A)";
(B) at least five business days prior to any meeting of the TriQuint Board
at which the TriQuint Board will consider whether such TriQuint Intervening
Event requires the TriQuint Board to effect, or cause TriQuint to effect, a
TriQuint Change in Recommendation, TriQuint provides RFMD with a written
notice specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons for
holding such meeting; (C) during such five business day period, if requested

obligation.

6.4 RFMD ESPP; TriQuint ESPP; Parent Equity Plans.

 

(a) RFMD shall take the necessary actions with respect to the RFMD ESPP so
that (i) the ending date of the current offering period shall occur prior to
the Effective Time (the "RFMD Final Purchase Date") and all outstanding

Purchase Date by applying the payroll deductions of each then current
participant to the purchase of whole shares of RFMD Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the RFMD ESPP, (ii) as of the RFMD Final Purchase Date, the
RFMD ESPP shall be suspended, and no offering periods or purchase periods

67\.  describing the treatment of the TriQuint ESPP pursuant to this Section
6.4(b) and Section 2.5, and (iv) conditional upon the occurrence of the
Initial Effective Time, the TriQuint ESPP shall terminate effective upon the
Initial Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 15 days after the date on
which the Mergers become effective, a registration statement on Form S-8, if
available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to the TriQuint Options, TriQuint RSUs and TriQuint
MSUs converted in accordance with Section 2.5 and the RFMD Options, RFMD RSUs
and RFMD PSUs converted in accordance with Section 2.6.

 

(d) As of the Initial Effective Time, Parent shall adopt and implement a stock
plan or plans pursuant to which Parent will have the authority to grant
equity awards including, but not limited to, options to acquire shares of
Parent Common Stock. Prior to the Initial Effective Time, RFMD and TriQuint
will mutually agree on the terms of such plan or plans, including, but not
limited to, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance thereunder.

(e) At the Initial Effective Time, Parent may (if Parent determines that it
desires to do so) assume any or all RFMD Equity Plans and TriQuint Equity
Plans. If Parent elects to assume an RFMD Equity Plan or TriQuint Equity Plan,
then, under such RFMD Equity Plan or TriQuint Equity Plan, as applicable,
Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible
under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such RFMD
Equity Plan or TriQuint Equity Plan, as applicable, as of the Initial

result of the termination of TriQuint Equity Awards or RFMD Equity Awards that
are assumed and converted by Parent pursuant to Section 2.5 or Section 2.6),
except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common
Stock; (ii) all references in such RFMD Equity Plan to a number of shares of
RFMD Common Stock or TriQuint Equity Plan to a number of shares of TriQuint

of referenced shares of RFMD Common Stock by the RFMD Exchange Ratio or
the number of referenced shares of TriQuint Common Stock by the TriQuint
Exchange Ratio, as applicable, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the Parent
Board or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the RFMD Board or any committee thereof with respect to the

provisions of Section 2.6 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, holders of RFMD Options, RFMD RSUs and RFMD PSUs have only those rights
with respect thereto specifically provided in Section 2.6; and (ii) prior to
the Initial Effective Time, TriQuint shall take all action that may be

have only those rights with respect thereto specifically provided in Section
2.5.

 

6.5 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) With respect to each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, and each vacation, sick leave, paid time off and severance plan
(that is not an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (each, a "Parent Benefit
Plan") in which any employee of any RFMD Corporation or any TriQuint
Corporation who continues employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the TriQuint

 



68\.  Surviving Corporation, the RFMD Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
will participate after the Effective Time, all service of the Continuing
Employees with the RFMD Corporations or the TriQuint Corporations, as the case
may be, shall be recognized for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and accrual and level of benefits, except to the extent
such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits. In addition,
Parent or Parents Subsidiaries (including the TriQuint Surviving Corporation,
the RFMD Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries), as
applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent
Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements other than preexisting condition limitations, exclusions or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees and that have not been satisfied or waived as of the Effective Time
under the analogous welfare benefit plan maintained for the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) recognize for each
Continuing Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents
for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums under such Parent Benefit Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by the Continuing Employee and his or her spouse,
domestic partner and dependents under an analogous RFMD Employee Plan or
TriQuint Employee Plan during the plan year of such plan in which occurs the
later of the Effective Time and the date on which the Continuing Employee
begins participation in such Parent Benefit Plan.

(b) Nothing in this Section 6.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create: (i) a right in any RFMD Associate or TriQuint Associate
to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporations or any of their
Subsidiaries; or (ii) with any RFMD Associate or TriQuint Associate any third-
party rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever. Nothing herein
shall be construed to limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporations or
any of their Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any Parent Benefit Plan, any
RFMD Employee Plan, any TriQuint Employee Plan or any other employee benefit
plan. Except for Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 6.6) to the extent
of their respective rights pursuant to Section 6.6, no RFMD Associate, no
TriQuint Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement. No provision of this Section 6.5 shall
modify or amend any other agreement, plan, program or document unless this
Agreement expressly states that the provision "amends" that other agreement,
plan, program or document.

(c) The Parties shall cooperate with one another to determine whether any
RFMD Employee Plan or TriQuint Employee Plan, as applicable, that contains a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code (a "401(k) Plan") will be terminated effective prior to the Initial
Effective Time. If RFMD is required to terminate any 401(k) Plan, then RFMD
shall provide to TriQuint prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the
adoption by the RFMD Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of such
401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to
the reasonable review of TriQuint); if TriQuint is required to terminate any
401(k) Plan, then TriQuint shall provide to RFMD prior to the Closing Date
written evidence of the adoption by the TriQuint Board of resolutions
authorizing the termination of such 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of
which resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review of RFMD).

 

(d) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of the
Contemplated Transactions, RFMD, TriQuint and Parent shall cooperate to ensure
that such requirements are complied with prior to the Initial Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, neither RFMD nor TriQuint shall, and each shall
ensure that its Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the RFMD
Corporations and TriQuint Corporations do not, communicate with any employees
of the RFMD Corporations or TriQuint Corporations regarding post-Closing
employment matters, including post-Closing employee benefits and
compensation, without the prior written approval of RFMD or TriQuint, as
applicable, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



69\. (e) It is the intent of RFMD and TriQuint that (i) the
Contemplated Transactions constitute a "change in control" (or words of
similar meaning) under any TriQuint Employee Plan, TriQuint Employee
Agreement, RFMD Employee Plan or RFMD Employee Agreement that provides for the
potential payment of benefits in connection with a "change in control" (or
phrases of similar meaning), whether such benefits are payable in the form of
equity (including accelerated vesting of equity) or cash, and (ii) benefits
shall only be payable under such plans and agreements in the event that the
employment or service of affected participants is terminated without cause or
for good reason within certain specific time periods following the "change in
control" event (that is, that benefits are intended to be payable upon a
"double trigger"). Unless otherwise agreed in writing by RFMD and TriQuint,
RFMD and TriQuint shall take any and all further actions, including amendment
of such plans and/or agreements, if required (with the terms of such
amendments or other actions being subject to the written consent of the other
party), as may be reasonably practicable to effectuate the intent stated
herein.

 

6.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporations, and their Subsidiaries to indemnify their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of any of the RFMD Corporations or TriQuint Corporations prior to
the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent that
applicable Legal Requirements permit a company to indemnify its own directors
and officers.

 

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporations shall cause to be maintained in effect the existing
policies of each of TriQuints and RFMDs directors and officers liability
insurance (or a comparable replacement policy) (the "DandO Policies") covering
claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time to the extent that such claims are of the type covered by the
DandO Policies (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to the
extent that such acts or omissions are covered by the DandO Policies) and
covering each Indemnified Party who is covered as of the Effective Time by the
applicable DandO Policy, in any case on terms with respect to coverage and
amounts that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those terms in effect
on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporations be required to expend in any one year an amount in
excess of 200% of the larger of the current annual premium paid by RFMD or
TriQuint (which annual premiums are set forth on Part 6.6(b) of the RFMD
Disclosure Schedule and the TriQuint Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance
(the larger such 200% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"); and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporations shall

the first sentence of this Section 6.6(b), Parent may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on each of the DandO Policies on terms with respect to
coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than the applicable
DandO Policy, and in the event that Parent shall purchase such a "tail" policy
or policies, Parent and the Surviving Corporations shall maintain such "tail"
policy or policies in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other applicable
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporations under the first sentence
of this Section 6.6(b) for so long as such "tail" policy or policies shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person

 



70\.  who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policies or the applicable "tail" policy
referred to in Section 6.6(b)) (and any of such persons heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policies
or the applicable "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.6(b) (and, after the
death of any of the foregoing persons, such persons heirs and
representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policies or the applicable "tail" policy referred
to in Section 6.6(b) (and, after the death of any of the foregoing persons,
such persons heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.6, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who
are beneficiaries under the DandO Policies or the applicable "tail" policy
referred to in Section 6.6(b) (and their heirs and representatives)) under
this Section 6.6 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by TriQuint, RFMD or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal Requirement (whether at law
or in equity).

respective Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns)
shall consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger, then in each case, to the extent necessary to protect the rights of
the Indemnified Parties, proper provision shall be made so that the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable) shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.
