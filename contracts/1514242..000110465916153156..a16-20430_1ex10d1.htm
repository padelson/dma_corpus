which has already been assigned or transferred to Purchaser or a Designated
Purchaser) to which Sellers in good faith determine they are reasonably likely
to need access for _bona fide_ Tax or legal purposes following the Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_Assumed Liabilities_**.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and

out of any violation of Law by, or any Action against, any Seller or any
breach, default or violation by any Seller of or under any Assigned Contract
or any Transferred Employee Plan, in either case, other than amounts
constituting Assumed Cure Costs.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** **_Excluded Liabilities_**. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, other than the Assumed Liabilities, neither
Purchaser nor any of the Designated Purchasers shall assume or shall be
obligated to assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any
Liability of Sellers or their Affiliates, and Sellers shall be solely and
exclusively liable with respect to all Liabilities of Sellers, including the

include, each of the Liabilities of any Seller (whether arising prior to, at
the time of or subsequent to Closing) set forth on _Schedule 2.4_ of the

from the failure to deduct, withhold or remit amounts under Tax Law on a
timely basis in accordance with applicable Law (each such Liability, a "
_Source Deduction Liability_ "), and Sellers shall be solely and exclusively
liable for any and all Excluded Liabilities. To the extent Purchaser assumes
the Van Nuys Lease as an Assigned Contract, Sellers covenant and agree to
satisfy the Van Nuys Claim in full prior to the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 2.5** **_Certain Covenants Related to Seller Contracts_**.

 



 

(a) _Obligation to Maintain Seller Contracts Until Closing_. From and after
the date hereof, Sellers shall not reject or alter in any material respect
(other than alterations in the Ordinary Course) the terms of Seller Contracts
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser or as provided below in
_Section 2.5(f)_. Sellers shall provide timely and proper written notice of
the motion seeking entry of the Sale Orders to all parties to the Seller
Contracts (excluding any Seller or Subsidiary thereof) and take all other
actions reasonable and necessary

 



      
 

 



 

to cause such Seller Contracts to be assumed by Sellers and assigned to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or section 11.3
of the CCAA to the extent that such Seller Contracts are Assigned Contracts at
Closing or are assumed and assigned to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_
of this Agreement. Without limiting or otherwise amending Sellers obligations
hereunder, at the Closing or at such time as a Designated Seller Contract is
assigned to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement, as
applicable, Purchaser shall assume the obligations under each Assigned
Contract pursuant to Section 365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Section 11.3
of the CCAA and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
of the requirements of Section 365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Section
11.3 of the CCAA necessary to permit such assumption and assignment.

 



 

(b) _Amendments_. At Purchasers request and sole cost and expense, Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser (i) to allow Purchaser to enter into
an amendment to any Designated Seller Contract, to be effective upon
assumption by Purchaser of such Designated Seller Contract as an Assigned
Contract, and shall cooperate with Purchaser to the extent reasonably
requested in negotiations with the counterparties thereto, or (ii) to
otherwise amend any Seller Contracts, to be effective upon assumption by
Purchaser of such Designated Seller Contract as an Assigned Contract, to the
extent such amendments would not adversely affect any Seller; _provided_ ,
that Sellers shall not be required to enter into any such amendment if such
amendment would result in (x) any Liability to any Seller that is not an
Assumed Liability (other than _de minimis_ Liabilities) or (y) an assumption
by any Seller of such Designated Seller Contract, unless such Designated
Seller Contract will be assigned to Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser at the
time of such assumption.

 



 

(c) _Excluding or Adding Assigned Contracts Prior to Closing_. Purchaser shall
have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) during the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the day that is one (1) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, to notify Sellers in writing of any Designated
Seller Contract that it does not wish to assume, or (ii) during the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the day that is ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date on which the Sale Hearings occur, to notify Sellers in
writing of any Seller Contract (including any Contract considered an Excluded
Seller Contract) that it wishes to add as a Designated Seller Contract, and
_Schedule 2.1(b)(i)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter shall be deemed amended
accordingly for all purposes hereunder upon receipt of any such notice, in
each case, without any adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price. Any Contract
removed from _Schedule 2.1(b)(i)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter pursuant
to this _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be deemed an Excluded Seller Contract. Any
Contract added to _Schedule 2.1(b)(i)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be deemed a Designated Seller
Contract.

 



 

(d) _Third Party Consents_. Sellers shall (x) provide notice of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to each counterparty to each
Seller Contract and (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
Consents required to permit the assignment to Purchaser or a Designated
Purchaser, as applicable, of the Acquired Assets (including each of the
Designated Seller Contracts). As part of the Sale Motion (or, as necessary in
one or more

 



      
 

 



 

separate motions), Sellers shall request that by virtue of a Seller providing
no less than ten (10) Business Days notice of its intent to assume and assign
to Purchaser the Designated Seller Contracts, the Bankruptcy Courts deem any
non-debtor party to any such Designated Seller Contract that does not file an
objection with the Bankruptcy Courts during such notice period to have given
any required Consent to the assumption of such Designated Seller Contract by
such Seller and assignment to Purchaser if, and to the extent that, pursuant
to the Sale Order or other Order of the Bankruptcy Court, such Seller is
authorized to assume and assign such Designated Seller Contract to Purchaser
and Purchaser is authorized to accept such Designated Seller Contract pursuant
to Section 365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and Section 11.3 of the CCAA.

 



 

(e) _Non-Assigned_ _Acquired Asset_ _s_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Acquired Asset (including any Designated
Seller Contract) is not capable of being assigned under Section 363 and
Section 365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Section 11.3 of the CCAA (or, if
applicable, pursuant to other applicable Laws or the terms of such Contract,
Lease, or Consent) to Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser, as applicable, at
the Closing without the Consent of any Third Party (including a Government
Entity) and such requisite Consent has not been obtained (or deemed to have
been obtained) as of the Closing (in the case of any such Contract, a " _Non-
Assigned Contract_ "), then, unless such Consent is subsequently obtained,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, transfer or assign,
directly or indirectly, such Acquired Asset (including any Non-Assigned
Contract) or any obligation or benefit arising thereunder if an attempted
direct or indirect sale, transfer or assignment thereof, without the Consent
of a Third Party (including a Government Entity), would constitute a breach,
default, violation or other contravention of the rights of such Third Party or
would be ineffective with respect to any party to a Contract concerning such
Acquired Asset. Any payment to be made in order to obtain any Consent required
by the terms of any Non-Assigned Contract shall be the sole responsibility of
Purchaser. From and after the Closing, Sellers shall (x) continue to maintain
(and shall not reject or alter (or attempt to alter) the terms of) any Non-
Assigned Contract unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser, (y) upon
request therefor from Purchaser, provide reasonable cooperation in obtaining
the Consent of any Third Party required for the assignment of such Non-
Assigned Contract to Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser, as applicable, and
(z) during the four (4) month period following Closing (or, if earlier, until
the conversion or dismissal of the Bankruptcy Proceedings), and subject to any
approval of the Bankruptcy Courts that may be required, reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser, at Purchasers sole cost and expense and as Purchaser directs,
to provide to Purchaser the benefits enjoyed by Sellers in respect of such
Non-Assigned Contract (including by enforcing for the account of Purchaser any
rights of such Seller under such Contract (including the right to elect to
terminate such Contract in accordance with the terms thereof upon the written
direction of Purchaser)); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 2.5(e)_ shall require Purchaser to reimburse Sellers for any
attorneys fees and expenses.

 



 

(f) _Rejection of Excluded Seller Contracts_. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Sellers shall reject all Excluded Seller Contracts; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Sellers reject
any Seller Contract related to any Non-Assigned Contract without the prior
written consent of Purchaser. Sellers shall be responsible for any rejection
damages owing to the counterparty to an Excluded Seller Contract.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Cure Costs_. Sellers shall prepare an exhibit of all Designated Seller
Contracts (the " _Assumption Schedule_ ") which shall (x) be filed with the
Bankruptcy Courts no later than December 12, 2016 and (y) set forth the
proposed Cure Costs (which proposed Cure Costs shall be submitted to Purchaser
for review and comment reasonably in advance prior to filing thereof and shall
provide Purchaser with such information in Sellers possession as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser so that it may verify such Cure Costs) and
an objection deadline for any counterparty to object to such proposed amounts
which deadline shall be at least five (5) days prior to the Sale Hearing. On
or before December 12, 2016, Sellers shall properly serve each counterparty to
a Designated Seller Contract a notice, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, setting forth the amount necessary to satisfy any
Cure Cost. Purchaser shall pay all Assumed Cure Costs and Sellers shall pay
all Excess Cure Costs, in each case, at the Closing (except to the extent
later payment is otherwise agreed by the other party to each such Designated
Seller Contract; _provided_ , that, Purchaser may, at Sellers option, cause a
portion of the Closing Cash Payment to be paid on behalf of Sellers directly
to the counterparties to the Designated Seller Contracts that are owed Excess
Cure Costs and the amount so paid by Purchaser shall reduce the Closing Cash
Payment paid to Sellers on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For purposes of this
Agreement, Cure Costs shall be the amount included on the Assumption Schedule,
as updated as specified below (without regard to any increased amount agreed
to by Purchaser) or otherwise determined by the Bankruptcy Courts. Sellers
shall deliver to Purchaser an updated estimate as of the Closing Date of the
Cure Costs no later than ten (10) days in advance of the Closing Date. To the
extent Seller Contracts are identified after the date which is ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date on which the Sale Hearings occur, by Sellers
or Purchaser as Seller Contracts that will be Designated Seller Contracts and,
as such, added to _Schedule 2.1(b)(i)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter,
including pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ or _Section 2.5(j)_, Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to determine the Cure Costs, if any, with
respect to such Designated Seller Contracts and the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to allocate payment of such Cure Costs among the Parties.

 



 

(h) _Adequate Assurances_. With respect to each Assigned Contract, Purchaser
will provide adequate assurance of future performance on its behalf and on
behalf of its Designated Purchasers as required under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, including Section 365(f)(2)(B) thereof, and under Section 11.3 of the
CCAA and shall cause its Designated Purchasers to perform thereunder as
required. Purchaser and Sellers agree that they will promptly take all actions
reasonably required to assist in obtaining a Bankruptcy Court finding that
there has been an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of future
performance under each Assigned Contract, such as furnishing affidavits, non-
confidential financial information or other documents or information for
filing with the Bankruptcy Courts and making Purchasers and Sellers
employees and representatives available to testify before the Bankruptcy
Court.

 



 

(i) _Deemed Consent_. For the purposes of this Agreement, the relevant Sellers
shall be deemed to have obtained all required Consents in respect of the
assignment of any Designated Seller Contract if, and to the extent that,
pursuant to the Sale Orders, Sellers are authorized to assume and assign to
the Designated Purchasers such Designated Seller Contract pursuant to Section
365 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Section 11.3 of the CCAA, as applicable,
and any applicable Cure Cost has been satisfied as provided in _Section
2.5(g)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) _Seller Contract Identification_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to identify any Seller Contracts that are not
listed on _Schedule 2.1(b)(i)_ or otherwise expressly excluded from the
Acquired Assets in the Sellers Disclosure Letter, and following the Closing,
Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in identifying any such Seller
Contracts, and the party identifying any such Seller Contract shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of the existence thereof. Any such Seller
Contract identified prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the date
on which the Sale Hearings occur, shall be subject to the provisions of this
_Section 2.5_ (including with respect to Purchasers rights to exclude or add
it under _Section 2.5(c)_). With respect to any such Seller Contract
identified following the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the date on which
the Sale Hearings occur, Purchaser shall have the right to notify Sellers in
writing that it wishes to accept the assignment of or reject such Seller
Contract, and Sellers shall use reasonable commercial efforts to take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause such Seller Contracts to be assigned to
Purchaser or rejected by Sellers, as the case may be (including by providing
notice and paying any Excess Cure Costs in a manner otherwise consistent with
this _Section 2.5_). For the avoidance of doubt, no further purchase price or
other amounts shall be payable by Purchaser to Sellers in respect of any such
assignment or rejection.

 



 

 **Section 2.6** **_Purchase Price_**.

 



 

(a) _Payment of Purchase Price_. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, in consideration of the sale of the
Acquired Assets pursuant to the terms hereof, Purchaser, on its own behalf and
as agent for the relevant Designated Purchasers, shall (a) assume from Sellers
the Assumed Liabilities, and (b) subject to the remaining provisions of this
_Section 2.6_ and provisions of this Agreement regarding application of the
Deposit, pay to Sellers an amount (the " _Closing Purchase Price_ ") in cash
equal to (i) the Base Purchase Price, _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable (ii)
the amount of the Property Tax Adjustment, as determined in accordance with
the terms of _Section 6.5_, _minus_ (iii) the Specified Assumed Liability
Deduction Amount, _minus_ (iv) the PCR AE Holdback Amount. Purchaser and
Sellers shall use reasonable commercial efforts to agree, in good faith, upon
a mutually acceptable value of the Specified Assumed Liability Deduction
Amount at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Credit Bidding; Deposit_. It is understood and agreed that a portion of
the Closing Purchase Price will be used by Sellers to repay all outstanding
obligations outstanding at the Closing under the DIP Credit Agreement (the "
_Repayable DIP Obligations_ "). Unless the Repayable DIP Obligations are or
will be $0 as of Closing as a result of borrowings under an Alternative DIP
Credit Agreement (disregarding, for the avoidance of doubt, any repayment or
deemed repayment as a result of the consummation of the transactions), at any
time prior to the Closing, Purchaser may deliver written notice to Sellers
that it has elected to pay a portion of the Closing Purchase Price by
offsetting amounts owed to Purchaser or one or more direct or indirect
investors in Purchaser, or an Affiliate of the foregoing, in an aggregate
amount not to exceed the Repayable DIP Obligations. The portion of the Closing
Purchase Price so specified by Purchaser (the " _Credit Bid Amount_ ") shall
reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the cash portion of the Closing Purchase
Price payable by Purchaser at Closing and Purchaser shall, subject to the
remaining provisions of this _Section 2.6_, pay the portion of Closing
Purchase Price in excess of the Credit Bid Amount to Sellers in cash (the "
_Closing Cash Payment_ "). The offset will be

 



      
 

 



 

effected by Purchaser tendering the obligation underlying the Credit Bid
Amount to the appropriate Seller, determined in accordance with _Section
2.6_. To the extent that the Credit Bid Amount is less than the Repayable DIP
Obligations (the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Sellers shall remain liable to repay
the Shortfall Amount to the lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement. The
Deposit Escrow Agent shall hold the Deposit pursuant to the Deposit Escrow
Agreement. The Deposit, plus all accrued interest or earnings thereon (net of
any amounts withheld in accordance with _Section 6.3(a)_), if any, shall be
returned to Purchaser or paid to Sellers as provided for in _Section 9.2(g)_
or upon Closing, applied towards the Closing Cash Payment in accordance with
_Section 2.7_ hereof.

 



 

(c) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall mutually agree on an
allocation of the Closing Purchase Price between assets to be acquired from
Sellers that are organized in the U.S., Sellers that are organized in Canada
and Sellers, if any, that are organized outside of the U.S. and Canada (the "
_Initial Allocation_ "), which allocation shall (1) allocate between fifty-
five percent (55%) and sixty-seven percent (67%) percent of the amount by
which the Closing Purchase Price exceeds the net book value of current assets
acquired by Purchaser from Sellers, to the non-current assets acquired by
Purchaser from Sellers that are organized in the U.S, and (2) allocate a
portion of the Closing Purchase Price to current assets acquired by Purchaser
from Sellers based on the net book value of such current assets (" _Initial
Allocation Principle_ "); _provided_ , that, if Sellers and Purchaser are
unable to agree on such Initial Allocation at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to Closing, then the Initial Allocation shall be resolved by a
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Sellers and
Purchaser, and Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall
each bear 50% of the costs of such accounting firm. The accounting firm shall
resolve such dispute in a manner consistent with the Initial Allocation
Principle.

 



 

(ii) Within thirty (30) days of the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers a proposed allocation schedule(s) (the " _Asset Allocation
Schedule(s)_ ") allocating the Closing Purchase Price (plus specific
allocation of the Assumed Liabilities that are treated as part of the purchase
price for income Tax purposes, as applicable) on a dollar basis among Sellers,
the Acquired Entities, the Acquired Investments and the remaining Acquired
Assets; _provided_ , that, (A) such schedule shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the principles described on _Schedule 2.6(c)_ (unless
otherwise required by a change in applicable Law), and (B) with respect to the
Acquired Assets that were acquired from Sellers that are United States persons
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, such schedule shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code. The parties
shall file all Tax Returns in accordance with the Asset Allocation Schedule(s)
and not take any other action inconsistent therewith unless otherwise required
by a final determination of a Tax Authority.

 



 

(iii) Sellers shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days after the delivery
of the Asset Allocation Schedule (the " _Response Period_ ") to present in
writing to Purchaser notice of any objections Sellers may have to the
allocations set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless Sellers
timely object, such Asset Allocation Schedule shall be binding on the parties
without further adjustment, absent manifest error.

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) If Sellers shall raise any objections within the Response Period,
Purchaser and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties fail to agree within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, then
the dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Purchaser, and Sellers, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other, shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the costs
of such accounting firm.

 



 

(v) The parties shall file their Tax Returns consistent with the Initial
Allocation and the Asset Allocation Schedule, in each case, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_.

 



 

(vi) For purposes of calculating any Transfer Taxes payable by Purchaser (and
any Designated Purchasers) in connection with Acquired Assets situated in
Canada under _Section 6.1(a)_, the Initial Allocation shall include any
relevant categories of property necessary to determine the applicable Transfer
Taxes and the provinces in which the Acquired Assets are situated.

 



 

 **Section 2.7** **_Closing of the Transactions Contemplated by this
Agreement_**.

 



 

(a) _Closing; Closing Date_. The completion of the purchase and sale of the
Acquired Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Closing_

been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by Sellers and/or Purchaser (as
applicable), or on such other place, date and time as shall be mutually agreed
upon in writing by Purchaser and Sellers (the day on which the Closing takes
place being the " _Closing Date_ "). Legal title, equitable title and risk of
loss with respect to the Acquired Assets will transfer to Purchaser or the
relevant Designated Purchasers, and the Assumed Liabilities will be assumed by
Purchaser or the relevant Designated Purchasers, at the Closing.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, at the Closing, the

occur immediately before the sale of the other Acquired Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

transfer in immediately available funds to accounts designated at least two

Canadian Debtors, and the Debtor Estates, in the case of the U.S. Debtors, in

of the Monitors Certificate and such other instruments of assignment or
transfer as Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser may reasonably deem
necessary in order to effect the sale, transfer and conveyance of the Acquired
Assets to Purchaser or such Designated Purchaser (including applicable short-
form assignments to record and perfect, to the extent possible, any issued,
registered or applied for U.S. or Canadian Transferred Intellectual Property
owned by any Seller).

 



 

(iii) _Joint Deliveries_. Each Party shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to such other Party (A) a duly executed counterpart to each Transaction
Document to which such Party is a party, (B) an executed instruction letter
instructing the Deposit Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit at the Closing to

_Section 2.8(a)_, one or more of its Affiliates to (i) purchase specified
Acquired Assets (including specified Assigned Contracts), (ii) assume
specified Assumed Liabilities, and/or (iii) employ specified Transferred
Employees on and after the Closing Date (any such Affiliate of Purchaser that
shall be properly designated by Purchaser in accordance with this clause, a "
_Designated Purchaser_ "), and any reference herein to Purchaser shall be
accordingly modified to include such Designated Purchaser as necessary to give
effect to such designation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such designation
shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder, but any payment
or performance by any Designated Purchaser shall be deemed to satisfy such
payment or performance obligation of Purchaser hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Notice of Designation_. The designation referred to in _Section 2.8(a)_
shall be made by Purchaser by way of a written notice to be delivered to
Sellers prior to the Closing (and in no event later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day prior to Closing), which written notice shall identify the
applicable Designated Purchaser(s) and shall indicate which Acquired Assets,
Assumed Liabilities and Transferred Employees (other than Employees which are

PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLERS HAVE NOT GIVEN AND WILL NOT BE DEEMED TO
HAVE GIVEN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,

statutes promptly upon receipt of same from the relevant Tax Authority.

 



 

 **Section 3.6** **_Financing_**. Purchaser has delivered to Sellers true and
correct copies of (i) an executed equity commitment letter (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ ") to Purchaser from Sagard Holdings Inc. and Fairfax
Financial Holdings Limited (the " _Sponsors_ ") pursuant to which the Sponsors
have committed to provide Purchaser with equity financing in the amount, and
on the terms and subject to the conditions, set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ ") for purpose of funding a portion of the Closing Purchase Price,
and (ii) an executed debt commitment letter to Purchaser from the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments thereto in effect as of the date hereof (other than any fee
letters), collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with
the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") pursuant to which
the Debt Financing Sources named therein have committed to lend to Purchaser
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the
Equity Financing, the " _Financings_ ") for the purpose of funding a portion
of the Closing Purchase Price. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters
are in full force and effect and to the knowledge of Purchaser, have not been
(and the respective commitments contemplated thereby have not been) withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect (except in a
manner contemplated or permitted by _Section 5.17_), and, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, no such amendment, modification, withdrawal or termination is
contemplated. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.1_ and _Section 8.3_, the net proceeds from the Financings available at the
Closing for such purposes will be sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at Closing. Each Commitment Letter is a legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Purchaser and of the Sponsors (in
the case of the Equity Commitment Letter) and, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
the other parties to the Commitment Letters, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally or
general principles of public policy and equity. There are no agreements, side
letters or other arrangements relating to the Commitment Letters that could
adversely affect the availability or amount of the Debt Financing or the
Equity Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
compliance with the terms of any fee letter related to the Debt Financing
(which fee letter does not contain any conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financings in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at Closing). As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Purchaser under any term or condition of the Commitment
Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financings, other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Purchaser has fully
paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees due and
payable in connection with the Commitment Letters. Assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.3_, as of the
date hereof and the compliance by Sellers with their obligations under
_Section 5.17(a)_, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to availability and funding of the Debt Financing contained in the
Commitment Letters will not be able to be satisfied.

 



 

 **Section 3.7** **_Investment Canada Act_**. Purchaser is not a Non-Canadian
within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 3.8** **_Qualification_**.

would cause, or be reasonably expected to cause, Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates not to qualify as "good faith" purchasers under Section 363(m) of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing, Purchaser reasonably believes it will be capable of
satisfying the conditions contained in Sections 365(b)(1)(C) and 365(f)(2)(B)
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Assigned Contracts.

of satisfying the conditions contained in Section 11.3 of the CCAA with
respect to the Assigned Contracts as of the date of the Sale Motion. As of the
Closing, Purchaser will be capable of satisfying the conditions contained in
Section 36(7) of the CCAA.

Purchaser with any such material information provided to any such Person that

Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** **_Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) Each Recipient shall treat confidentially and not disclose, other than as

directors, bidding partners, advisors, investors, potential financing sources,
holders of an Equity Interest in the Recipient and their respective
Affiliates, as applicable (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ");
_provided_ , that such Representatives acknowledge the existence of these
confidentiality obligations and agree to be bound thereby and; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information of
a Discloser to its Representatives that are direct or indirect competitors of
such Discloser, and (ii) to any court of competent jurisdiction, to the extent
required; _provided_ , that the foregoing obligations of Purchaser shall
automatically terminate at the Closing and be of no further force or effect;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and

the confidential nature of such information.

 



 

(b) A Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to those of its
Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose
of implementing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Recipient
shall use, nor permit its Representatives to use, Confidential Information for
any other purpose nor in any way that is, directly or indirectly, detrimental
to the applicable Discloser.

 



 

(c) If a Recipient or any of its Representatives receives a request or is
legally required to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information

the request or requirement, (ii) consult with the Discloser on the
advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow the request
or lawfully avoid the requirement, and (iii) if requested by the Discloser,
take all necessary steps to seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy. If a protective order or other remedy is not available, or if the
Discloser waives compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.10(c)_,
(A)

 



      
 

 



 

the Recipient receiving the request for disclosure or its Representatives, as
the case may be, may disclose to the Person requiring disclosure only that
portion of the Confidential Information which such Recipient is advised by
written opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and (B) such
Recipient shall not be liable for such disclosure unless such disclosure was
caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by such Recipient or its
Representatives not permitted by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Following the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, each Recipient shall (and shall cause each of
its Representatives to) (i) return promptly to the Discloser all physical

in such Recipients possession or in the possession of its Representatives,
(ii) destroy all (A) electronic copies of such Confidential Information, and

Parties_**. To the extent that, after the Closing Date, (a) Purchaser or any
Designated Purchaser receives any payment or instrument that is for the
account of a Seller according to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Designated Purchasers to promptly deliver such amount or
instrument to the relevant Seller, and (b) any Seller receives any payment
that is for the account of Purchaser or any of the Designated Purchasers
according to the terms of this Agreement or relates primarily to the Business,
Sellers shall promptly deliver such amount or instrument to Purchaser or the
relevant Designated Purchasers. All amounts due and payable under this
_Section 5.11_ shall be due and payable by the applicable Party in
immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account designated in
writing by the relevant Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party
hereby undertakes to use reasonable commercial efforts to direct or forward
all bills, invoices or like instruments to the appropriate Party. To the
extent that after the Closing, all or any portion of the Adequate Assurance
Deposits are repaid to or for the benefit of any Seller, Sellers shall
promptly pay over the amount thereof to Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 5.12** **_Post-Closing Assistance for Litigation_**. After the
Closing, Purchaser shall, upon the written request of Sellers, and at no cost
to Sellers (other than reimbursement of out of pocket expenses and reasonable
legal expenses), make the Transferred Employees available at reasonable times
and cooperate in all reasonable respects with Sellers and their Affiliates in
the preparation for, and defense of any Action (whether disclosed or not
disclosed in the Sellers Disclosure Letter) filed or claimed against Sellers
or any of their Affiliates or any of the respective agents, directors,
officers and employees of Sellers and their Affiliates, whether currently
pending or asserted in the future, concerning the operation or conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** **_Insurance Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that coverage of the Acquired Assets,
tangible or intangible property, Assumed Liabilities, ownership, activities,
businesses,

 



      
 

 



 

operations, current and former shareholders, and current and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of, the Business (collectively with the
Business, the " _Covered Assets and Persons_ ") under all current or previous
insurance policies of Sellers and their Affiliates, including all
environmental, directors and officers Liability, fiduciary Liability,
property and casualty flood, ocean marine, contaminated products and all other
insurance policies or programs arranged or otherwise provided or made
available by Sellers or their Affiliates that cover (or covered) any of the
Covered Assets and Persons at any time prior to the Closing (the " _Seller
Insurance Policies_ ") shall cease as of the Closing Date and the Covered
Assets and Persons will be deleted in all respects as insured (or additional
insured, as the case may be) under all Seller Insurance Policies, except to
the extent covering part of the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall (i) retain any
rights to, including any right to any proceeds received in respect of, any
claim pending as of the date hereof or made after the date hereof under any
Seller Insurance Policy, even if such claims relates to the Acquired Assets or
properties of the Business; and (ii) have the right to purchase "tail"
insurance coverage that provides directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance to the officers and directors of the
Sellers.

 



 

(b) If, after the Closing Date, Purchaser or Sellers (or any of their
respective Affiliates) reasonably require any information regarding claim data
or other information pertaining to a claim or an occurrence reasonably likely
to give rise to a claim (including any pre-Closing claims under the Seller
Insurance Policies that are to be covered under the retrospective component of
the new insurance policy) in order to give notice to or make filings with
insurance carriers or claims adjustors or administrators or to adjust,
administer or otherwise manage a claim, then Sellers or Purchaser, as the case
may be, shall cause such information to be supplied to the other (or their
designee), to the extent such information is in their possession and control
or can be reasonably obtained by Sellers or Purchaser (or their respective
Affiliates), as applicable, promptly upon a written request therefor. If
Purchaser desires access to, and utilization of, claims data or information
maintained by an insurance company or other Third Party in respect of any
claim (including any pre-Closing claims under any Seller Insurance Policies
that are covered under the retrospective component of the new insurance
policies), Purchaser shall be exclusively responsible for acquiring from such
insurance company or Third Party, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, the
rights necessary to permit them to obtain access to and utilization of such
claims data or information. If any Third Party requires the consent of Sellers
or any of their Affiliates to the disclosure of such information, such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

 **Section 5.14** **_Maintenance of Books and Records_**. After the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the Business in existence on the Closing Date and,
subject to compliance with applicable Law, make the same available for
inspection and copying by Sellers (at each such Sellers expense) for any
reasonable business purpose during normal business hours of the Business upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable notice; _provided_ , that neither
Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose to any Seller any
information if such Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in
a litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
, _further_ , that Purchaser may destroy (or cause to be destroyed) any such
books, records and other documents pertaining to the Business if

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser first advises Sellers in writing of its intention to destroy such
materials and provides Sellers a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
thereof (subject in each case to compliance with applicable Law).

 



 

 **Section 5.15** **_Reserve Payment Amount_**. Purchaser shall be kept
reasonably informed of, and shall have full rights of participation in, the
determination by the CCAA Court of any and all of the matters identified in
the definition of Reserve Payment Amount (the " _Reserve Payment Amount
Matters_ ") and no Reserve Payment Amount Matter may be allowed or settled
without the consent of Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, and any such allowance or settlement entered into without such
consent shall not be entitled to payment from the Reserve Payment Amount. Upon
notice to the Canadian Debtors, Purchaser shall be entitled to assume the
defense of any Reserve Payment Amount Matter.

 



 

 **Section 5.16** **_Name Change_**. Sellers and each of their Subsidiaries
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to, as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing
Date), cease using all Trademarks included in the Transferred Intellectual
Property (the " _Business Marks_ "), and take such corporate and other actions
necessary to change their corporate and company names to ones that are not
similar to, or confusable with, the Business Marks, including any necessary
filings required by applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall any such new corporate names include the
following terms or phrases: "BAUER", "MISSION", "MAVERIK", "CASCADE", "EASTON"
or "COMBAT".

 



 

 **Section 5.17** **_Obligations in Respect of Financings_**.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, provide to Purchaser, and shall use their
reasonable commercial efforts to cause their directors, officers, employees,
counsel, auditors and representatives to provide to Purchaser, such reasonable
cooperation as is customary for debt financings of the type contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and as is reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing (including any
Alternative Financing), including, but not limited to using reasonable
commercial efforts to (i) cause Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries
management teams, with appropriate seniority and expertise, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice, to participate in (including by preparing
for) a reasonable number of bank meetings and similar presentations to and
with prospective lenders and rating agencies; (ii) have appropriate members of
senior management of the Company execute customary authorization letters and
assist with the preparation of a confidential information memorandum or
similar offering document (including a private supplement) for the Debt
Financing and customary rating agency presentations; (iii) execute and deliver
such documents with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, to the extent required by the Debt Commitment
Letter, providing a borrowing base certificate) as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser or otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral
(including obtaining customary payoff letters and the release of any existing
Liens); (iv) furnish Purchaser and its Debt Financing as promptly as
practicable the financial statements required to be made available under
Section 9(c) of Exhibit B of the Debt Commitment Letter and financial data or
inputs reasonably necessary for the preparation of pro forma financial
statements and projections reasonably required to be made available pursuant
to

 



      
 

 



 

Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of Exhibit B of the Debt Commitment Letter; (v)
cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers efforts to obtain consents, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance, as reasonably requested by Purchaser;
(vi) providing access at reasonable times during business hours for reasonable
inventory appraisals and field examinations by third party auditors and
providing information necessary for determining the applicable "borrowing
base" to the extent reasonable and customary for asset-based loan facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; and (vii) to the extent requested
by Purchaser in writing at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, furnishing Purchaser and its financing sources promptly, and in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with
all documentation and other information required under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT Act, that has been reasonably requested by Purchaser and/or the Debt
Financing Sources. To the extent that Purchaser informs Sellers that it wishes
to raise alternative or additional financing on or before Closing, then this
_Section 5.17(a)_ shall also apply to such alternative or additional
financing.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to (i)
arrange and obtain the Financings on terms and conditions (including any
applicable "flex" provisions) described in the Commitment Letters and any
related fee letter, (ii) satisfy all terms and conditions applicable to
Purchaser set forth in the Commitment Letters (including any applicable "flex"
provisions) that are within its control, (iii) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letters, negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions substantially consistent with the Commitment Letters,
and (iv) upon satisfaction of the conditions contained in such definitive
agreements, consummate the Financings at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if funds in the amounts and on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter become unavailable to Purchaser on the terms and conditions set forth
therein (after giving effect to any "flex" provisions contained therein or in
any related fee letter), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an
amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that
remains available (or after taking into account any increase in the Equity
Financing), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that if Purchaser proceeds with Alternative Financing, it, shall
be subject to the same obligations, taken as a whole, with respect to such
Alternative Financing as set forth in this _Section 5.17_ with respect to the
Debt Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.17_ shall require, and in no
event shall the reasonable best efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to
require, Purchaser to (A) to seek or incur Alternative Financing or incur the
Debt Financing if any term thereof is less favorable than any applicable
economic provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or any related fee letter
(including any "flex" provision), or on any other terms that are less
favorable to Purchaser, taken as a whole, than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter or any related fee letter, (B) pay any fees in excess of
those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letter
(whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise) or
(C) seek the Equity Financing from a Person other than the Sponsors.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse
change with respect to such Debt Financing. Purchaser shall promptly notify
the Company of (i) the expiration or termination of the Debt Commitment Letter
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) any written refusal by any party to the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter to provide its portion of the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) any material breach or default by any party to
the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Debt
Financing, or (iv) receipt of any written notice from any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter with respect to any actual breach, default, termination or
repudiation of the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall not replace, amend
or waive the Debt Commitment Letter (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any provision of a related fee letter (including the "market flex" provisions
therein) without the Companys prior written consent if such replacement,
amendment or waiver reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(without a corresponding increase in the Equity Financing), amends the
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing, in each case, in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or
make the funding of the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur.
Purchaser shall provide to the Company copies of any commitment letter
associated with any Alternative Financing as well as, upon written request of
the Company, any amendment or waiver of any debt commitment letter (including
the Debt Commitment Letter) that is permitted hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser shall be permitted to
amend the Debt Commitment Letter (and any fee letter related thereto) to add
or replace lenders (and Affiliates of such lenders) as a party thereto.

 



 

 **Section 5.18** **_Pre-Closing Reorganization_**. Notwithstanding _Section
5.7_ and any other provision of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that
Sellers and the Acquired Entities shall be entitled to participate in a pre-
closing reorganization set forth on _Schedule 5.18_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter (the " _Pre-Closing Reorganization_ ") and take all actions necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the Pre-Closing Reorganization, in each case as
long as such Pre-Closing Reorganization does not delay or impede Closing and,
to the extent involving any Acquired Entity, does not cause any violation of
any Law to which it is subject or any breach or default under any Contract to
which it is party. All Taxes and other Liabilities arising from the Pre-
Closing Reorganization shall be Excluded Liabilities (other than any such
Taxes or Liabilities of the Acquired Entities to the extent up to the PCR AE
Holdback Amount). Sellers may change the Pre-Closing Reorganization;
_provided_ , that Purchasers written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, shall be required to implement any such
change if (a) such change involves Acquired Entities, or (b) such change
results in a material risk of an unreimbursed cost or Liability to Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 5.19** **_Wind Down_.** Purchaser shall, following the Closing
Date, make available to Sellers such Transferred Employees to provide
assistance with the wind-down of Sellers as the Company may reasonably request
solely for the following purposes: (a) corporate dissolution filings with
respect to the Securities and Exchange Commission, (b) corporate dissolution
filings with respect to the Ontario Securities Commission, (c) U.S. final tax
period filings and (d) Canadian final tax period filings. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Purchaser shall be responsible for the fees and expenses,
subject to a limit of $430,000 in the aggregate, associated with such wind-
down activities; _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be liable for
any fees or expenses incurred by Sellers or any of their respective advisors
or legal counsel.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VI 
TAX MATTERS

 



 

 **Section 6.1** **_Transfer Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that the purchase price for the Acquired Assets is
exclusive of any Transfer Taxes resulting from or arising in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, and any Transfer
Taxes shall be borne by Sellers, excluding GST and QST, which shall be borne
entirely by Purchaser. Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_ and _Section 6.2_,
Sellers shall promptly pay when due directly to the appropriate Tax Authority,
or promptly reimburse Purchaser upon demand and delivery of proof of payment,
all such Transfer Taxes, and shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed
in connection therewith (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). On
Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers any applicable GST or QST.

 



 

(b) If any Seller wishes to claim any exemption relating to, or a reduced rate
of, Transfer Taxes, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein or the other Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated therein, such Seller shall be solely responsible for ensuring
that such exemption or election applies and, in that regard, shall provide
Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser prior to Closing with its permit number
or other similar registration numbers and/or any appropriate certificate of
exemption, election and/or other document or evidence to support the claimed
entitlement to such exemption or reduced rate by such Seller, as the case may
be. Purchaser shall cooperate to the extent necessary to obtain any such
exemption or reduced rate, including under Section 1146(a) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

(c) Each relevant Seller undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to
provide to Purchaser on or before the Closing Date a certificate (a "
_Clearance Certificate_ ") pursuant to Section 6 of the Retail Sales Tax Act
(Ontario) or similar legislation in those jurisdictions in which the Acquired
Assets are located, to the extent such relevant Seller was registered for
purposes of the Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario) or similar legislation,
indicating that such Seller has paid all provincial sales taxes collectable or
payable by such Seller up to the Closing Date or has entered into satisfactory
arrangements for the payment of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, until such time as the appropriate Clearance
Certificate(s) have been provided to Purchaser, the Sellers agree to indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser (and any Designated Purchasers), its officers,
directors, employees and controlling persons for any provincial sales tax,
penalties and interest payable or assessed for failure to obtain a Clearance
Certificate.

 



 

 **Section 6.2** **_Tax Elections_**.

 



 

(a) If applicable, on Closing, each relevant Seller and Purchaser (or the
relevant Designated Purchaser) shall execute jointly an election under section
167 of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) and section 75 of _An Act respecting the
Quebec Sales Tax_ to relieve the sale of the Acquired Assets from GST and QST.
Purchaser (or the relevant Designated Purchaser) shall file such elections no
later than the filing date for its GST and QST returns for the reporting
period in which the Closing takes place. Notwithstanding such election(s), in
the event it is

 



      
 

 



 

determined by the CRA or Revenu Quebec that there is a liability of Purchaser
(or a Designated Purchaser) to pay, or of a Seller to collect and remit, any
Taxes payable under the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) or _An Act respecting the Qu
ebec Sales Tax_ in respect of the sale and transfer of the Acquired Assets,
such Taxes shall be paid by Purchaser (or a Designated Purchaser) and
Purchaser and the Designated Purchasers shall indemnify and save Sellers (and
any present or former directors and officers of any Seller) harmless,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to
any such Taxes and costs payable resulting from such determination. If it is
determined that the elections are not available, Sellers agree to provide
reasonable cooperation to Purchaser or the Designated Purchaser to expedite
Purchasers or the Designated Purchasers claims for input tax credits, input
tax refunds or rebates of GST and QST.

 



 

(b) Purchaser (or the relevant Designated Purchaser) and each Seller, if
applicable, shall jointly execute and file an election under subsection 20(24)
of the Tax Act in the manner required by subsection 20(25) of the Tax Act and
under the equivalent or corresponding provisions of any other applicable
provincial or territorial statute, in the prescribed forms and within the time
period permitted under the Tax Act and under any other applicable provincial
or territorial statute, as to such amount paid by each Seller to Purchaser (or
the relevant Designated Purchaser) for assuming future obligations. In this
regard, Purchaser (or the relevant Designated Purchaser) and each Seller, if
applicable, acknowledge that a portion of the Acquired Assets transferred by
each such Seller and having a value equal to the amount elected under
subsection 20(24) of the Tax Act and the equivalent provisions of any
applicable provincial or territorial statute is being transferred by each such
Seller as a payment for the assumption of such future obligations by
Purchaser.

 



 

(c) If available, Purchaser (or the relevant Designated Purchaser) and each
Seller, as applicable, shall elect jointly in the prescribed form under
section 22 of the Tax Act, section 184 of the Taxation Act, if applicable, and
the corresponding provisions of any other applicable Tax statute as to the
sale of the applicable Accounts Receivable and designate in such election an
amount equal to the portion of the purchase price allocated to such Accounts
Receivable pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_. This election, or these elections,
shall be made within the time prescribed for such elections.

 



 

 **Section 6.3** **_Withholding Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Purchaser and
Sellers, as applicable, shall have the right to deduct and withhold from any
payments to be made hereunder such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld under applicable Law, and to collect any necessary Tax forms,
including IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or any similar information,
from Purchaser, Sellers and any other recipients of payments hereunder;
_provided_ , that, assuming Sellers deliver Purchaser the certificates
described in this _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_, and assuming that
all representations and warranties of Sellers set out in this Agreement are
correct, no Party is aware of any obligation under Canadian or U.S. Law to
deduct or withhold on any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement. In
the event a Party becomes aware of any such obligation, such Party will use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other Party and
reasonably cooperate with such other Party to reduce or eliminate any such
withholding, to the extent feasible under applicable Law. To the extent that

 



      
 

 



 

amounts are withheld and remitted to the appropriate Tax Authority in
accordance with _Section 6.3(a)_, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to Purchaser,
Sellers or any such other recipient of payments in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent, if any, that the representation and warranty made by
Sellers under _Section 4.21_ (Taxable Canadian Property) is not true and
correct in all material respects at Closing as indicated in the certificate
referred to in _Section 8.3(d)_, Purchaser shall have the right to withhold
the amount Purchaser is entitled to withhold under the Tax Act (and the
Taxation Act, if applicable) by reason of its acquisition of TCP or TQP from a
non-resident of Canada, and any amount so withheld shall be remitted forthwith
to the applicable Tax Authority, and a receipt evidencing such remittance
shall be delivered forthwith by Purchaser to Sellers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, Purchaser agrees to delay remitting any such amounts
withheld pursuant to the foregoing sentence to a Tax Authority until one (1)
Business Day prior to the day it is required to do so by applicable Law, and
agrees to reasonably comply with any certificate or letter obtained from the
relevant Tax Authority which expressly permits Purchaser to further delay
remitting any withheld amounts or which eliminates or reduces the amount that
must be remitted.

 



 

(b) Any Seller transferring a "United States real property interest" as
defined by Section 897(c) of the Code (and any other Seller that is not a
"foreign person" for purposes of Section 1445 of the Code) shall deliver to
Purchaser a duly executed certification of non-foreign status, in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, in compliance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b), certifying such facts as to establish that the
sale of the United States real property interest is exempt from withholding
under Section 1445 of the Code; _provided_ , that Purchasers sole recourse in
the event of any failure to deliver any such certification shall be to
withhold from amounts payable under this Agreement in accordance with _Section
6.3(a)_. Each Seller that is a "United States person" within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to Purchaser a duly executed IRS
Form W-9.

 



 

 **Section 6.4** **_Records_**. Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_,
(i) after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Designated Purchasers on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, will make available to the other, as
reasonably requested, and to any Tax Authority, all information, records or
documents relating to liability for Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities and the Business for all periods prior to or including
the Closing Date, and will preserve such information, records or documents
until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions
thereof, and (ii) in the event that one Party needs access to records in the
possession of a second Party relating to any of the Acquired Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Business for purposes of preparing Tax Returns or
complying with any Tax audit request, subpoena or other investigative demand
by any Tax Authority, or for any other legitimate Tax-related purpose not
injurious to the second Party, the second Party will allow representatives of
the other Party access to such records during regular business hours at the

 **Section 6.5** **_Property Tax Allocation_**. For purposes of _Section
2.3(a)(iv)_, (a) all Taxes of the Acquired Entities based on income, receipts
or similar measures shall be apportioned between the Sellers, on the one hand
and the applicable Designated Purchaser, on the other hand based on a closing
of the books as of the Closing Date, and (b) all real and personal property
Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Acquired
Assets, whether imposed or assessed before or after the Closing Date ("
_Periodic Taxes_ ") for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), shall be apportioned between
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser or the applicable Designated
Purchaser, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date based on the number of
days of such taxable period included in the period ending with and including
the Closing Date (together with periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
the " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and the number of days of such taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date (together with any periods beginning
after the Closing Date, the " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). At the Closing,
Periodic Taxes with respect to each Acquired Asset for the applicable Tax
period shall be prorated in accordance with the foregoing provisions based on
the Tax assessment for such Acquired Asset for the applicable Tax period, if
available, or otherwise, based on the last available Tax assessment with
respect to such Acquired Asset. Sellers shall be responsible for such Periodic
Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the applicable Purchaser
shall be responsible for such Periodic Taxes attributable to Post-Closing Tax
Periods. At the Closing, the Closing Purchase Price shall be (x) decreased by
an amount equal to excess, if any, of the (i) unpaid Periodic Taxes with
respect to Acquired Assets purchased by such Purchaser attributable to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods over (ii) such Periodic Taxes paid by Sellers but
apportioned hereunder to Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser for Straddle
Periods, or (y) increased by an amount equal to the Periodic Taxes apportioned
to Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser with respect to Straddle Periods but
previously paid by Sellers (each determined in accordance with the foregoing
principles) (such increase(s) or decrease(s) in the Closing Purchase Price,
the " _Property Tax Adjustment_ ").

 



 

 **Section 6.6** **_Cooperation_**. Subject to _Section 5.18_, Sellers and
Purchaser shall work together and cooperate reasonably to minimize any Taxes
that may be imposed on any Seller, Acquired Entity, Purchaser or Designated
Purchaser as a result of the transactions contemplated herein, including by
cooperating with respect to the implementation of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization.

 



 

 **Section 6.7** **_Tax Returns_**. Designated Purchasers shall file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities that include any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods in a manner consistent with past practice, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to
filing any such Tax Returns Designated Purchasers shall provide draft Tax
Returns to Sellers for their review and approval, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

 **Section 6.8** **_Release of PCR AE Holdback Amount_**. The PCR AE Holdback
Amount shall be applied to pay the Tax shown due on the Tax Returns required
to be filed pursuant to _Section 6.7_. If the PCR AE Holdback Amount exceeds
the Taxes shown as due on the Tax Returns described in _Section 6.7_, then
within ten (10) Business Days of filing such Tax Returns the Designated
Purchasers shall pay such excess in cash to Sellers.

Transferred Employees Effective Hire Date.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall assume and honor the amount of compensation with respect
to the accrued and unused vacation days that is due and owing to the
Transferred Employees up to their Effective Hire Date under applicable Law.
Purchaser will, and will cause the relevant Designated Purchasers to, honor
such accrued and unused vacation days in the ordinary course.

 



 

(iii) Neither _Section 7.1(a)_ nor this _Section 7.1(b)_ restricts the right
of Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee after the
Closing at any time for any or for no reason, in accordance with applicable
Law.

 



 

(iv) Purchaser and each applicable Seller hereby agree to follow the standard
procedure for employment tax withholding as provided under applicable Law.

under any Seller Employee Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement or any Liabilities under
or with respect to any Seller Employee Plan or any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement;

 



 

(c) any Liabilities relating to or at any time arising in connection with the
employment or service with or termination of employment or service from any
Seller (or any of its Affiliates) of any employee, agent, or contractor of

agent, or contractor or former employee, agent, or contractor of such Seller
or such Affiliate), including with respect to wages, salary or other

7.2_ of this Agreement, after the date hereof, and subject to each Partys
disclosure obligations imposed by

 



      
 

 



 

Law or by Government Entities and each Partys obligations hereunder,
Purchaser shall not, and shall procure that the Designated Purchasers and any
of Purchasers Affiliates shall not, issue any announcement or communication
to their respective employees or the Employees, prior to consultation with,
and the approval of, Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If
requested, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in respect of the
development and distribution of any announcement and communication to the
employees of Sellers, including Employees, with respect to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Purchaser undertakes, and shall cause the Designated Purchasers to
undertake, to keep the Employee Information in confidence and that, until the
relevant Employee Transfer Time:

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Designated Purchasers to, restrict
the disclosure of the Employee Information only to such of its employees,
agents and advisors as is permitted by applicable Law and is necessary for the
purposes of effectuating this Agreement prior to the Employee Transfer Time;

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Designated Purchasers not to,
use the Employee Information except for effectuating this Agreement and shall
be returned to Sellers or destroyed, at Sellers election, if this Agreement
is terminated; and

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Designated Purchasers to, comply
with such additional obligations as may be reasonably required in any
particular jurisdiction to comply with any applicable data privacy Laws.

 



 

(c) Sellers and Purchaser intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Transferred Employee prior to or upon the occurrence of the
Employee Transfer Time, including for purposes of any Seller Employee Plan in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or under applicable Law or any
other legally mandated obligations, and Seller and Purchaser intend that the
Transferred Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment
immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with each other to provide for an
orderly transition of the Transferred Employees from Sellers to Purchaser or
the Designated Purchasers, as applicable, and to minimize the disruption to
the respective businesses of the Parties resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) _Section 280G Matters_. As soon as practicable following the execution of
this Agreement but in any case prior to the Closing:

 



 

(i) Sellers will use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, prior to the
initiation of the 280G Approval, a waiver (a " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ "),
in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, from each Transferred Employee
who, with respect to Sellers, reasonably could be a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) and who, with respect to Sellers, reasonably might
otherwise receive, have received, or have the right or entitlement to receive
any

 



      
 

 



 

parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, pursuant to which Parachute
Payment Waiver each such Transferred Employee will agree, unless the 280G
Approval has been obtained in a manner which satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder and Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-32, to waive any and
all right or entitlement to the payments, acceleration of vesting and/or other
benefits referred to in this _Section 7.4(e)_ to the extent the value thereof
exceeds 2.99 times such Transferred Employees base amount determined in
accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.

 



 

(ii) Sellers will use reasonable commercial efforts to submit to the
Bankruptcy Courts for approval all such waived payments in a manner such that,
if such approval is obtained by the Bankruptcy Courts in a manner which
satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and Internal Revenue Bulletin 2004-32, no payment or benefit
received by such "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" for
purposes of Section 280G of the Code (the " _280G Approval_ "). Prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser evidence that the 280G
Approval was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.4(e)_ (to the extent such 280G Approval was required to be solicited in
connection with payments with respect to which Sellers were required to use
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain a Parachute Payment Waiver in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of _Section 7.4(e)_) and that either
(i) 280G Approval was obtained or (ii) 280G Approval was not obtained, and as
a consequence, the parachute payments subject to the Parachute Payment Waivers
shall not be made or provided.

 



 

(iii) In connection with the foregoing, at least five (5) days before taking
such actions, the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser for review and comment
(i) parachute payment calculations prepared by the Seller or its advisors and
(ii) copies of all Bankruptcy Court disclosure materials and a form of the
Parachute Payment Waiver that will be used to effectuate the undertaking set
forth in this _Section _ _7.4(e)_ , which comments by Purchaser shall be
reasonably considered by the Sellers.

 



 

 **Section 7.5** **_No Obligation_**. Nothing contained in this _Article
VII_ shall be construed to: (a) require the employment or service of (or
prevent the termination of employment or service of), or any particular term
or condition of employment or service of, any individual, (b) require minimum
benefit or compensation levels or prevent any change in the benefits or
compensation provided to any individual Transferred Employee, (c) establish or
amend any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement
or arrangement, or (d) restrict the ability of Purchaser or any Designated
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates to amend or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement that is
at any time established or maintained or contributed to by any of them. No
provision of this _Article VII_ shall create any rights (including any third-
party beneficiary rights) in any Employee or former Employee of Sellers or any
other Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) other than the
Parties to this Agreement of any nature or kind whatsoever, including in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) for any specified
period.

warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein and other than conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing and which were, as
of such date, capable of being satisfied) or waived and Purchaser fails to
deliver the Closing Cash Payment at the Closing; _provided, however,_ that any
purported termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(ii)_ shall be deemed to be a termination by Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ if Sellers are entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ at the time of such termination.

 



 

 **Section 9.2** **_Effects of Termination_**.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, then
subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 9.2_, all further
obligations of the Parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate
without further liability of any Party to the other, except that the
provisions of (i) _Section 5.5_ (Public Announcements), (ii) _Section 5.9_
(Transaction Expenses), (iii) _Section 5.10_ (Confidentiality), (iv) this
_Section 9.2_ (Effects of

 



       
 

 



 

Termination), (v) _Article X_ (Miscellaneous) and (vi) _Article I_
(Interpretation), to the extent applicable to the interpretation or
enforcement of such provisions, shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by any Party pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)(iv)_ or by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_, or by any
Party pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ at a time when this Agreement was
terminable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_, then
Purchaser shall be entitled to the reimbursement of, and the Company shall
promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days after such termination,
reimburse Purchaser in immediately available funds for, all reasonable out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable professionals fees and
expenses) incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Sponsors and
their respective Affiliates) in connection with their investigation (including
due diligence), preparation, negotiation and attempted consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including performance of the
Business obligations hereunder), in the maximum amount of $3,500,000 (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ ").

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Purchaser pursuant
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, _(iv)_ , _(vi)_ or _(vii)_ , (ii) by any Party
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_, or (iii) by any Party pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(ii)_ at a time this Agreement was terminable by Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, _(iv)_ , _(vi)_ or _(vii)_ , or by any Party pursuant
to _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_, then in any such event of termination, Purchaser
shall be entitled to the payment of a break-up fee of $20,125,000 (the "
_Break-Up Fee_ "). When this Agreement is terminated (A) by any Party pursuant
to _Section 9.1(a)(iv)_, or (B) by any Party pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(ii)_ at a time this Agreement was terminable by any Party pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)(iv)_, Purchaser shall be entitled to payment of the Break-Up
Fee upon such termination, but Sellers may delay the payment of the Break-Up
Fee until the date that is the earlier of (x) the date upon which any such
Alternative Transaction is actually consummated, if applicable, and (y) the
date that is sixty (60) days following the date upon which this Agreement is
so terminated. In all other circumstances in which Purchaser is entitled to
payment of the Break-Up Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.2(c)_, the
Break-Up Fee shall become due and payable by Sellers to Purchaser immediately
upon termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) In addition, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ (other than _clauses (iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(vi)_
and _(vii)_ thereof), or by any Party pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ at a
time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ (other
than _clauses (iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(vi)_ and _(vii)_ thereof), and the Company
consummates (or enters into an agreement to consummate) an Alternative
Transaction (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include seeking or
having confirmed a plan of reorganization) within the twelve (12) months
following such termination, Purchaser shall be entitled to payment of the
Break-Up Fee upon consummation of such Alternative Transaction.

 



 

(e) The obligations of the Company to pay the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense
Reimbursement (A) shall be entitled to administrative expense claim status
under Sections 503(b)(1)(A) and 507(a)(2) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and
under an order to that effect issued by the CCAA Court and shall be a
superpriority administrative expense claim ( _i.e._ , senior to all other
administrative expense claims and payable out of Sellers cash or other
collateral security under Sellers obligations to their senior secured lenders
and prior to any recovery by such

 



      
 

 



 

lenders) of Sellers under Section 364(c)(1) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or
the inherent jurisdiction of the CCAA Court, (B) shall not be subordinate to
any other administrative expense claim against the Company and (C) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
9.2(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of the Company to pay
the Break-Up Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement shall be junior to any claims or
obligations of the Company arising under any Order of the Bankruptcy Courts
authorizing the Sellers entry into the ABL DIP Credit Agreement or a DIP
Credit Agreement. Sellers shall seek the approval of the Break-Up Fee and
Expense Reimbursement as set forth in this paragraph and this Agreement in the
Bidding Procedures Order.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Break-Up Fee becomes due and payable hereunder, the
Break-Up Fee payable to Purchaser shall be reduced by the amount of the Work
Fee actually paid to Purchaser.

 



 

(g) If this Agreement is terminated (or deemed terminated in accordance with
the proviso to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_) by Sellers pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_, Purchaser shall direct the Deposit Escrow Agent to disburse the
Deposit to Sellers in immediately available funds, to an account designated by
Sellers to the Deposit Escrow Agent in writing. Upon any termination of this
Agreement (other than a termination (or deemed termination in accordance with
the proviso to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_) by Sellers pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_), the Deposit shall be disbursed by the Deposit Escrow Agent to
Purchaser in immediately available funds, to an account designated by
Purchaser to the Deposit Escrow Agent in writing. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary herein (including _Section 9.2(a)_), except
_Section 10.2_, the Deposit is the sole and exclusive remedy and liquidated
damages of the Company Related Parties, whether at Law or in equity, for any
breach by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Sponsors and their
respective Affiliates) of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, and no Purchaser Related Party
shall have any further Liability of any kind to any Company Related Parties on
account of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

 **Section 10.1** **_No Survival of Representations and Warranties or
Covenants_**. Except for the covenants identified in _Section 9.2(a)_, no
representations or warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive beyond the
Closing Date. Accordingly, no claim of any nature whatsoever for breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements may be made, or
Action instituted, after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be satisfied after the
Closing Date shall survive until satisfied in accordance with their terms.

 



 

 **Section 10.2** **_Waiver; Remedies_**.

 



 

(a) No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege under this Agreement by any Party will operate as a waiver
of such right, remedy, power or privilege, nor will any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or

 



      
 

 



 

privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, remedy, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and
that irreparable harm would result if this Agreement were not specifically
enforced. Therefore, subject to _Section 10.2(c)_, prior to any valid
termination of this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the Parties shall
be enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction, and, to the extent permitted by law, the Parties shall
be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief in connection therewith, without
the necessity of posting a bond or other security or proving actual damages
and without regard to the adequacy of any remedy at law. Each Party agrees to
waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection
with any proceeding seeking specific performance of this Agreement and that
the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for
specific performance of this Agreement is that it contests the existence of a
breach or threatened breach thereof. The rights set forth in this _Section
10.2_ shall be in addition to any other rights which a Party may have at law
or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company, Sellers nor any other
Person shall be entitled to seek or obtain specific performance of Purchasers
obligation to obtain the Equity Financing or consummate the Closing unless
each of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waived by the party entitled to the benefit thereof (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to such conditions being capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Debt Financing
(or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing) has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded, (iii) Purchaser has
failed to consummate the Closing when requested in accordance with _Section
2.7(a)_, and (iv) each Seller has irrevocably confirmed to Purchaser in
writing that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing (or, if
applicable, the Alternative Financing) is funded, and Purchaser otherwise
complies when requested with its obligations hereunder, then the Closing will
occur.

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. This Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Debt
Financing Sources may enforce (and each is an intended third party beneficiary
of) the provisions of _Section 9.2(g)_, this _Section 10.3_, _Section
10.4_, _Section 10.5_, _Section 10.6_, _Section 10.14_ and _Section
10.15(b)_ (and in each case the definitions related thereto) that are related
to the Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **_Consent to Amendments; Waivers_**. No Party shall be
deemed to have waived any provision of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents unless such waiver is in writing, and then such waiver
shall be limited to the circumstances set forth in such written waiver. This
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall not be amended, altered or
qualified except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties hereto
or thereto, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein,

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.2(g), Section 10.3_, this _Section 10.4_, _Section 10.5_,
_Section 10.6_, _Section 10.14_ and _Section 10.15(b)_ (and in each case
the definitions related thereto) may not be amended and/or waived in a manner
that is materially adverse to a Debt Financing Source without its prior
written consent.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **_Successors and Assigns_**. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, all representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents by or on behalf of the Parties thereto will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of such Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld in such Partys sole
discretion, except for (a) assignment to an Affiliate of a Party ( _provided_
, that such Party remains liable jointly and severally with its assignee
Affiliate for the assigned obligations to the other Party), (b) assignment by
a U.S. Debtor to a succeeding entity following such U.S. Debtors emergence
from Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and (c) assignment by any of the
Canadian Debtors pursuant to any plan of arrangement approved by the CCAA
Court, which will not require the consent of Purchaser; _provided_ , that
Purchaser may assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations pursuant
to this Agreement to the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing; _provided_
, _further_ , that such assignment shall not permit any foreclosure or other
execution on such assignment prior to the Closing and that no such assignment
shall in any manner limit or affect Purchasers obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 10.6** **_Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial_**.

 



 

(a) Any questions, claims, disputes, remedies or Actions arising from or
related to this Agreement (including, to the extent required by the Debt
Commitment Letter, any claim or cause of action involving the Debt Financing
Sources (or any Alternative Financing sources), and any relief or remedies
sought by any Parties, shall be governed exclusively by the Laws of the State
of New York without regard to the rules of conflict of laws applied therein or
any other jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party (i) agrees

Bankruptcy Court, if brought prior to the entry of a final decree closing the
Chapter 11 Case, with respect to the U.S. Debtors, (B) the CCAA Court, if
brought prior to the entry of a final decree closing the CCAA Proceedings,
with respect to the Canadian Debtors, or (C) in all other circumstances, in

_Courts_ "), if brought after entry of such final decree closing the Chapter
11 Case or CCAA Proceedings, _mutatis mutandis_ , and shall not be brought, in
any court in the United States of America, Canada, or any court in any other
country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts, as
applicable pursuant to the preceding _clauses (i)(A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_ , for
purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of, or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not
to assert any

 



      
 

 



 

objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action brought in such a court or any claim that any such Action brought
in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv) agrees that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 10.7_ or any other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof, and (v)
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 10.6_.

 **Section 10.8** **_Exhibits; Sellers Disclosure Letter_**. The Sellers
Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits attached hereto constitute a part of this
Agreement and are incorporated into this Agreement for all purposes as if
fully set forth herein.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 10.9** **_Counterparts_**. The Parties may execute this Agreement
in two (2) or more counterparts (no one of which need contain the signatures
of all Parties), each of which will be an original and all of which together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

 **Section 10.10** **_No Presumption_**. The Parties agree that this
Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms length and that the
final terms of this Agreement are the product of the Parties negotiations.
Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has sought and received experienced
legal counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of this
Agreement and the rights and obligations affected hereby. The Parties each
acknowledge and agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly
and equally drafted by them, and that the provisions of this Agreement
therefore should not be construed against a Party on the grounds that such
Party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provisions.

 



 

 **Section 10.11** **_Severability_**. If any provision, clause, or part of
this Agreement, or the application thereof under certain circumstances, is
held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, (a)
as to such jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of
such provision, clause or part under other circumstances, and (b) as for any
other jurisdiction, any provision of this Agreement, shall not be affected and
shall remain in full force and effect, unless, in each case, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability in such jurisdiction materially impairs the
ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Upon such determination that any clause or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in such jurisdiction, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible even in
such jurisdiction.

 



 

 **Section 10.12** **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents set forth the entire understanding of the Parties
relating to the subject matter thereof, and all prior or contemporaneous
understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, whether written or
oral (including the Confidentiality Agreement), are superseded by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and all such prior or
contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) are hereby terminated. In the event
of any irreconcilable conflict between this Agreement and any of the other
Transaction Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail,
regardless of the fact that certain other Transaction Documents, such as the
Local Sale Agreement, may be subject to different governing Laws (unless the
other Transaction Document expressly provides otherwise).

 



 

 **Section 10.13** **_Damages_**. Under no circumstances shall any Party be
liable for punitive damages or indirect or incidental damages arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or any breach or alleged breach of any of the terms hereof, including damages
alleged as a result of tortious conduct.

 



 

 **Section 10.14** **_Bulk Sales Laws_**. Subject to _Section 6.1(c)_
(Clearance Certificates), each Party waives compliance by the other Party with
any applicable U.S. bulk sales Law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 10.15** **_Non-Recourse_**.

 



 

(a) No past, present or future director, officer, manager, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of the Company or any other Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, in each case, other than any Seller who is a party hereto, shall
have any liability under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company and
the other Sellers agree on behalf of themselves and their respective
Affiliates that none of the Purchaser Related Parties (other than Purchaser)
shall have any liability or obligation to the Company, the other Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein (including the Debt Financing), in each case
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person
(including a claim to enforce the Debt Commitment Letter) or otherwise. This
_Section 10.15(b)_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by Purchaser
and the Purchaser Related Parties (including the Debt Financing Sources, and
each such Person shall be a third party beneficiary of this _Section
10.15(b)_) and shall be binding on all the respective successors and permitted
assigns of the Company and each Seller.
