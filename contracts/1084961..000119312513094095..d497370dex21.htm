"), are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of its stockholders, (c)
resolved to recommend that the Company stockholders adopt this Agreement
and (d) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Companys

follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on the date that is two (2)
Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or
such other date, time or place as is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing the parties hereto shall file with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed in accordance with, and
in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL with
respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon the acceptance of the Certificate of Merger by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the
" _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their
entirety to be in the form of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
Merger Sub, attached hereto as Exhibit A, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall at the Effective Time be changed to "Asset
Acceptance Capital Corp." and as so amended shall be the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section 5.8_). 

 



2 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Each
of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the directors
and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.7 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, if the Surviving
Corporation shall determine or shall be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired
or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, in each
case, in accordance with the terms hereof, then the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise,
all such other actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), any other securities of the Company or any shares of capital stock
or other securities of Merger Sub or, except as expressly set forth herein,
on the part of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall thereupon constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



3 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted
automatically into, and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be converted, subject to _Section 2.5_, into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.50 without interest (the "
_Cash Consideration_ ").

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") is properly made and not
revoked pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (each, a " _Stock Electing Company Share_
") shall be converted, subject to _Section 2.3(e)_ and _Section 2.5_, into
the right to receive 0.2162 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_, the "
_Stock Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock may be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Maximum Stock
Election_ ") and any shares of Company Common Stock elected to be exchanged
for shares of Parent Common Stock above the Maximum Stock Election shall be
subject to proration as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_ below.

(iii) Each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which neither a Cash
Election nor a Stock Election has been effectively made (including withdrawn
elections pursuant to _Section 2.2_) (each, a " _Non-Electing Company Share_
"), shall be converted, subject to _Section 2.5_, into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration.

(d) _Proration_. If holders of Company Common Stock elect to receive Stock
Consideration in excess of the Maximum Stock Election, then the number of
shares exchanged for Stock Consideration by each stockholder so electing will
be reduced, such that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged by such stockholder for shares of Parent Common Stock equals the
product determined by multiplying (i) the Maximum Stock Election by (ii) the
ratio that the number of shares elected to be exchanged by such stockholder
bears to the total number of shares elected to be exchanged for shares of
Parent Company Stock by all Company stockholders. To the extent a Company
stockholder does not receive Stock Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock that such stockholder elected to be exchanged for Stock
Consideration due to the proration provided in this _Section 2.1(d)_, such
stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Cash Consideration for each such
remaining share of Company Common Stock not exchanged for Stock
Consideration.

(e) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of shares
of Company Common Stock not represented

 



4  by certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_ or
_Section 2.3_, (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ and (iii)
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, in each case without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding Taxes.

 

Section 2.2 _Election Procedures_.

(a) At the time of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to holders of
record of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (such date, the " _Mailing Date_ "), (i) an election form, (ii) a
letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, upon adherence to the procedures set forth
in the letter of transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (iii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
(the material described in _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , collectively, the
" _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder to specify (i) the number of
shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such
holder makes a Cash Election, and (ii) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to make a Stock
Election. Any shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form
on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day that is four (4)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly
announced by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) (or such other time and
date as the Company and Parent shall agree in writing) (the " _Election
Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be Non-Electing Company Shares. If the
Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent shall promptly
announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election
Deadline.

(c) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to make Election Forms available
as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become
holders of Company Common Stock between the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Election Deadline, and the Company shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to
perform as specified herein and as specified in any agreement with the
Exchange Agent.

 



5 (d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed and signed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline
accompanied by any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Company Common Stock. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the
Person submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form
is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Electing Company Shares;
_provided_ that a subsequent election may be made with respect to any or all
of such shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Election
Deadline pursuant to this _Section 2.2_. In addition, all Cash Elections and
Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked and all Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares representing shares of Company Common Stock in the custody of the
Exchange Agent shall be promptly returned without charge if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ of this Agreement or otherwise
upon the written request of the holder who submitted the applicable Election
Form and shares of Company Common Stock.

(e) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent, in consultation with both Parent and the Company, shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any
submitted Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent or the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in an Election Form.

 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration and enter into an agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to
be performed by the Exchange Agent. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Exchange Agent at the
Closing. The Cash Consideration portion of such aggregate Merger Consideration
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its disbursement to
such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest. Any interest and other
income from such investments shall become part of the funds held by the
Exchange Agent for purposes of paying the Cash Consideration portion of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, subject to _Section 2.3(g)_. No investment
by the Exchange Agent of the Cash Consideration portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this _Article II_ and
Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_. No investment
by the Exchange Agent of the Cash Consideration portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective Time,
Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, additional cash or additional

 



6  shares of Parent Common Stock to pay (A) the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_ , (B) cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.3(e)_ and (C) any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ without interest.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (other than any holder which has previously and properly surrendered all
of its Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to the Exchange
Agent in accordance with _Section 2.2_) (i) a letter of transmittal (which,
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates,
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required
withholding Taxes, the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest, for
each share of Company Common Stock surrendered, and any Certificates
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of such Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (A) the Person requesting such exchange present
proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive (1) the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , (2) cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ and (3) any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_,
in each case without interest and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share that is a Stock Electing Company Share with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of any fractional shares will be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.3(e)_, until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrenders 

 



7  such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax
or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor will be paid,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) on the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(d) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
The applicable Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock and, at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.3(g)_, if,
at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates representing, or Book-Entry Shares that are, Stock Electing
Company Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of a
fractional share interest will be paid an amount in cash (without interest
and subject to any withholding Tax) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all fractional share interests then held by such holder)
would otherwise be entitled by (ii) $30.07. As promptly as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent will so notify Parent, and
Parent will promptly deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and will
cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
share interests in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.3_.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed

 



8  Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

(g) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds or other property (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this
_Article II_ , and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to
this _Article II_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_, and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)_, that may be payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held
by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration or any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

(i) _Dissenting Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent in respect of any
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

(j) _Tax Treatment_. The parties agree and acknowledge that the Merger will
be treated as a taxable purchase of shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration (and not as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code) for United States federal, state and local income
Tax purposes.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Parent shall not assume any Options in connection with the Merger. Each
holder of an option (an " _Optionholder_ ") that represents the right to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not
then vested or exercisable) (each, an " _Option_ ") shall be provided with
notice pursuant to which all outstanding Options held by such Optionholder
shall become fully vested and may be exercised by such Optionholder for a
period of at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement
and Company Stock Plan under which such Option was granted. To the extent that
any outstanding Option is not so exercised on or prior to the 

 



9  Effective Time, such Option shall be cancelled and terminated at the
Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration _over_ the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock underlying such Option; _provided_ that if the
exercise price per share of any such Option is equal to or greater than the
Cash Consideration, such Option shall be canceled without any payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock
Plans (" _Company RSUs_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and each outstanding deferred stock unit (" _Company DSUs_ "
and together with the Company RSUs, collectively, the " _Company Stock Units_
") shall be cancelled and entitle the holder thereof to receive from the
Company, in full settlement of such Company Stock Units, a cash amount equal
to the product of (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Units (using, if
applicable, the goal (100%) level of achievement under the respective award
agreement to determine such number).

 

(c) No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this _Section 2.4_. All payments required under this
_Section 2.4_ shall be made at the Effective Time.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof), shall adopt any resolutions and shall cause
the Company to take any actions that may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ of this _Section 2.4_ and to
terminate, as of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans, and no further
Options, Company RSUs or Company DSUs or other rights with respect to Company
Common Stock shall be granted thereunder.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration,
the exchange ratios and any other similarly dependent items shall
be equitably adjusted; _provided,_ _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any
such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a
stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in
writing) and who (a) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to and (b) complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting_

 



10   _Shares_ "), but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost
rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such
right to appraisal, or if appraisal rights are unavailable to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the
Transactions, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the applicable Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common
Stock, in accordance with _Section 2.1_, without any interest thereon and
less any applicable withholding Taxes. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct, in each case at its own expense, all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands prior to the
Effective Time.

 

Section 2.7 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by such
holder providing information or documentation to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such information shall be requested prior
to any such withholding.

therein, as such statements and reports may have been amended since the date
of their filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that are registration

or supplement thereto will, at the time such Form S-4 or any amendment or
supplement thereto is filed with the SEC or at the time such Form S-4 becomes
effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state

connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. When filed, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.

(c) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Document, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), (ii) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except (A) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (B) as

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and the results of their operations and cash flows, for each of
the dates and for the periods shown, in conformity with GAAP (subject to
normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements that were not, or are not expected to be, material in amount).

Insurance Policies are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or default, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any
action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach
or default, or permit termination of any of the Company Insurance Policies.
No written notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the
Company with respect to any such Company Insurance Policy other than as is
customary in connection with renewals of existing Company Insurance Policies.
Set forth on _Section 3.21_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a true and
complete list of all currently outstanding claims made by the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Company Insurance Policies. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has failed to timely report any claim under a Company
Insurance Policy, except where such failure to timely report would not result
in a material liability. There has been no reservation of rights by any
insurance carrier, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such reservation is
threatened, concerning the coverage of the Company with respect to any matter
required to be disclosed pursuant to this _Section 3.21_.

insurance coverage by any insurance carrier.

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information (both financial and nonfinancial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Parent

procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Parent SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such

Section 5.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders
Meeting_. 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date hereof),
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as Parents
prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Transactions. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus together with the Election
Form to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days) after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any filings
with the SEC deemed to supplement the Form S-4 or any document which forms a
part thereof through its incorporation by reference therein or with respect
to a Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or any matters relating thereto. Parent or the Company, as applicable,
will advise the other party promptly after it receives oral or written notice
of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of
any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to

 



38  Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably possible after the Form S-4 has
been declared effective, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders to consider the approval of the Transactions and such other
matters as may be then legally required (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening
the Company Stockholders Meeting if the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof), after consultation with outside legal counsel, reasonably
determines that failure to delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall, through the Company Board (or the Review Committee or
other duly authorized committee of the Company Board), but subject to the
right of the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly authorized
committee of the Company Board) to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 5.3_, (i) recommend to its stockholders that the
Company Stockholder Approval be given (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ")
and (ii) include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

 

Section 5.3 _Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its and
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and employees to, and shall instruct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, (i)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its
Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal,
(ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any Person prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal, and (iii) terminate the
access granted prior to the date hereof of any Persons (other than Parent and
its Representatives) to any "data room" hosted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives relating to any Takeover Proposal.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_ and except as otherwise permitted by this
_Section 5.3_, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its and
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and employees not to, and shall instruct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate the making, submission or

 



39  consummation of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, or otherwise
participate in any discussions (except to notify such Person of the existence
of the provisions of this  _Section 5.3_) or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any material non-public information in connection with,
any Takeover Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section
5.3(b)_, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that, from the date hereof until
11:59 p.m. New York City time on the later of (x) March 27, 2013 (the " _Go
Shop End Date_ ") and (y) if an Excluded Party submits a Superior Proposal on
or before the Go Shop End Date, 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the date on
which the SP Notice Period with respect to that Superior Proposal expires
(such later date, the " _Excluded Party End Date_ "), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have the right to (i)
solicit, initiate, encourage and facilitate, whether publicly or otherwise,
Takeover Proposals, including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements (
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives) and (ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with respect to Takeover Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or
offers or other efforts or attempts that could lead to a Takeover Proposal) or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, offers, efforts, attempts, discussions or negotiations,
in each case with any Excluded Party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives
receives a written Takeover Proposal from any Person or group of Persons which
Takeover Proposal was made on or after the date hereof and did not result from
a material breach of this _Section 5.3_, the Company, the Company Board (or
the Review Committee or other duly authorized committee of the Company Board)
and their Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with, or
furnish any information and other access to, any Person making such Takeover
Proposal and any of its Representatives or potential sources of financing if
the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly authorized committee
of the Company Board) determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover
Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
that the failure to engage in negotiations and discussions with, or furnish
any information and other access to, such Person would reasonably be expected
to be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that
prior to furnishing any material non-public information to any such Person,
the Company receives from the Person making such Takeover Proposal an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours of receipt) notify Parent of any Takeover Proposal,
together with a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal, the identity of the Person or group making any such
Takeover Proposal and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement
provided by such Person. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on
a timely basis (including within 48 hours after the occurrence of any
material amendment, modification, development, discussion or negotiation
relating to any such Takeover Proposal) of the status and material details of
any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any
non-public

 



40  information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to
such Person (to the extent such information was not previously provided to
Parent or its Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to _Section 5.3(g)_, in no event shall Parent
(whether pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)(B)_ or otherwise) make more than one
(1) request to the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly
authorized committee of the Company Board) to publicly reaffirm its approval
and recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement in respect of (x) each
Takeover Proposal and (y) each material amendment to or modification of a
Takeover Proposal.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.3(f)_, the Company Board
shall not (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, or
(B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to
the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this _clause (i)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or similar agreement with
respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval the Company Board (or the
Review Committee or other duly authorized committee of the Company Board) may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (x) a
Superior Proposal or (y) an Intervening Event (and, solely with respect to a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_), if:

(i) the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly authorized
committee of the Company Board) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of
this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.4(f)_);

(ii) solely with respect to a Superior Proposal: (A) the Company provides
Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_, together with a copy of the acquisition agreement (and any other
relevant transaction documents) with respect to such Superior Proposal, if
any, at least three (3) Business Days (such period, as it may be extended in
accordance with this _Section 5.3(f)_, the " _SP Notice Period_") prior to
taking such action, to the effect that the Company Board (or the Review
Committee or other duly authorized committee of the Company Board) has
received a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board (or the Review Committee or
other duly authorized committee of the Company Board) has resolved to effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, which notice shall specify the basis for
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or termination, including the
material terms of the Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ")
(it being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not

 



41  in itself be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that any
material revision or amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice, which notice shall cause the SP Notice Period to run
for three (3) Business Day from the date of such new notice); (B) during the
SP Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives reasonably available to discuss with Parents Representatives
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; (C)
Parent has not, within the SP Notice Period, made a written, binding and
irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms
or conditions of this Agreement such that such Takeover Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal and (D) the Company Board (or the Review
Committee or other duly authorized committee of the Company Board), after
taking into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of such notice,
continues to believe that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; and

(iii) solely with respect to any Intervening Event: (A) at least three (3)
Business Days (such period, the " _IE Notice Period_ " and, together with the
SP Notice Period, the " _Notice Period_ ") before making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to such Intervening Event, the Company
notifies Parent in writing of its intention to do so, specifies the reasons
therefor and provides a description of such Intervening Event; and (B) if
Parent makes a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being
accepted by the Company during the IE Notice Period to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board (or the Review Committee or
other duly authorized committee of the Company Board), after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

During any Notice Period prior to its effecting a Company Board
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the
Company shall, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of
the Transactions proposed by Parent.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly authorized committee of
the Company Board) from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company if the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly
authorized committee of the Company Board) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law,
(iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in
this _Section 5.3_ or (iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the

 



42  Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the stockholders of the
Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.3(g)_, the Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section 5.3(f)_; and
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if any such statement or disclosure
made by the Company pursuant to  _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ above contains
anything beyond a factually accurate statement or a statement that would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to Parents or the Companys
ability to consummate the Transactions, Parent shall be entitled to request
in writing that the Company Board publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation and it shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board fails to do so within five (5) Business Days of
the date of such request. Any requests for reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 5.3(g)_ shall not count as a request
by Parent for purposes of the last sentence of  _Section 5.3(d)_. No
disclosures permitted under this _Section 5.3(g)_ shall be, in themselves, a
breach of _Section 5.3_ or a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VII_. Notwithstanding this _Section 5.3_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt
of Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or the Review Committee or
other duly authorized committee of the Company Board) may grant a waiver or
release under, or determine not to enforce any standstill agreement of the
Company (other than a standstill agreement with any Excluded Party) if the
Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly authorized committee of
the Company Board) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of their fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall give Parent notice of
the grant by the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly
authorized committee of the Company Board) at least 24 hours before granting
any such waiver or release.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub and any of its Affiliates thereof) or "group" (as such term is defined in
the Exchange Act) to purchase or otherwise acquire, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, (i) assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of
assets in the ordinary course of business) that account for 20% or more of the
Companys consolidated assets (based on the fair market value thereof) or
from which 20% or more of the Companys revenues, earnings or cash flows on a
consolidated basis are derived or (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding Company
Common Stock pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer or
similar transaction.

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Company Board (or the
Review Committee or other duly authorized committee of the Company Board)
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, (i) to be more favorable to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Transactions from a financial point
of view (after taking into account any revisions to this Agreement set forth
in any written, binding and irrevocable offer by Parent capable of being
accepted by the Company), taking into account, to the extent applicable, the
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of such proposal and
this Agreement that the Company Board (or the Review Committee or other duly
authorized committee of the Company Board) considers relevant, (ii)
the financing of which is fully committed or reasonably likely to be obtained
and (iii) if accepted, is

 



43  reasonably likely to be consummated (in the case of each of the foregoing
_clauses (ii)_ and _(iii),_ as determined in good faith by the Company Board
(or the Review Committee or other duly authorized committee of the Company
Board)); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal,
the references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%."

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the

under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iii)

with respect to the Transactions and (v) make all necessary notices to and
obtain all actions or non-actions, approvals, consents, waivers,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable (but in any event on or
prior to the End Date). For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the
Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act
and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party

any additional information and documentary material that may be required or
requested by any Governmental Authority and (B) use its reasonable best

waivers, permits, authorizations or other actions or non-actions from each
Governmental Authority as soon as practicable.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, (i) promptly notify the other
parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or,
in the case of 

 



44  oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication
to such Person from a Governmental Authority and permit the others to review
and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by
the others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a
Governmental Authority, (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions
and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or discussions with a
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of Parent
and Company may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and
any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors
or their equivalents of the other party without approval of the party
providing the non-public information.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or
resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents,
approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be required by
any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties to close the
Transactions as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the End Date), including committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the
termination, relinquishment, modification or waiver of existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries (each a "
_Remedial Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any Remedial Action may,
at the discretion of Parent and the Company, be conditioned upon consummation
of the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, become
subject to, consent to or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect
to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
to sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose
of any assets, business or portion of business of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts,
including a Remedial Action, to avoid or resolve any such litigation, action
or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate
with each other and shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the End Date.

 



45 (f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets
(other than portfolios of defaulted receivables), business, Person or division
thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or
otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to increase the
risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver
under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions.

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial
press release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and
approve, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system (and then only after as much
advance notice and consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 5.5_ shall not apply to any
release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with a Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto or (b) in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions. In addition, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not make
any internal announcements to their employees regarding the Transactions
without the prior review and approval of Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonable withheld, conditioned or delayed) except to the extent such
announcements are consistent in all material respects with the prior public
disclosures regarding the Transactions.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company and
Parent shall afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Companys or Parents,
as applicable, properties, books, Contracts and records and the Company and
Parent shall furnish promptly to the other party such information concerning
its business and properties as such party may reasonably request (other than
any publicly available document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws); _provided_ that the Company, Parent and
their respective Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the other party; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and Parent
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the Company or
Parent, as applicable, determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so
would violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality
owing to a third-party ( _provided_ that the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of third
parties that are necessary to allow such information to be disclosed to the
other) or jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in loss of the attorney-client privilege). Until the Effective
Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the 

 



46  Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 12, 2012, between Parent and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Company shall not, and Parent and
Company shall cause their respective Representatives not to, use such
information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.
No investigation shall affect the Companys, Parents or Merger Subs
representations and warranties contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(b) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that each (i) had an
opportunity to discuss the business of other party with the management of the
other party, (ii) has had access to the books and records, facilities,
contracts and other assets of the other party which it and its affiliates have
requested to review, (iii) has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions
of and receive answers from officers of the other party and (iv) has conducted
its own independent investigation of the other party, its businesses and the
Transactions.

 

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent or its ability to consummate the Transactions.

 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that would be likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other
Transaction not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other
Transaction not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7(b)_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each current and former director, officer and
employee of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and each person
who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages,

 



47  judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission relating to their position with the
Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at
the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability,
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided in (A)
the Company Charter Documents and the respective organizational documents of
each of the Companys Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (B) any
indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee that are in effect as of the
date hereof and set forth on  _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, which shall in each case survive the Transactions and continue in
full force and effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnitees no less favorable to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the
Company Charter Documents in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees except as
required by applicable Law for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time.

 

(b) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay and advance to an
Indemnitee any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under
this  _Section 5.8_ or the enforcement of an Indemnitees rights under this
_Section 5.8_ as and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses (but only to the
extent required by applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable
organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements that are in effect as of the date hereof and set
forth on _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnitees conduct complies
with an applicable standard under applicable Law, the Company Charter
Documents, applicable organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company,
or applicable indemnification agreements, as the case may be, shall be made by
independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and reasonably
acceptable to Parent.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time either through the
Companys existing insurance provider or another provider reasonably selected
by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, after the Effective Time, Parent
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date

 



48  hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto
(which premium is set forth on _Section 3.21_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which the Surviving
Corporation would be permitted to spend during the sixyear period provided
for in this _Section 5.8(c)_, that provides coverage no materially less
favorable than the coverage described above. 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.8_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies unless (A)
such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the
affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
5.8_).

(e) In connection with any claim for indemnification pursuant to any policy,
agreement or governing document contemplated by this _Section 5.8_, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide such information
and updates regarding such claim (including regarding the status of, and
material developments arising in connection with, the defense thereof) as
reasonably requested from time to time by Indemnitees party to such claim.

 

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 

Section 5.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party hereto shall keep the other
parties hereto reasonably informed of, and cooperate with the other parties
hereto in connection with, any litigation or claim against any party hereto
and/or its directors, officers or employees relating to the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require any party
hereto to take any action if it may result in a waiver of any attorney/client
or any other similar privilege. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in
connection with, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of, any such litigation, and no settlement in
connection with any such litigation shall be agreed to prior to the Effective
Time without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, however, that no
settlement requiring a payment or an admission of wrongdoing by a director
shall be agreed without such directors consent.

 

Section 5.10 _Section 16_. The Company and Parent shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of
equity securities of

 



49  the Company (including derivative securities with respect to such equity
securities of the Company) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31,
2013 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and who, during the
Continuation Period, continues such employment with the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ "), annual base salary and base
wages and employee benefits (but excluding equity incentive compensation), in
each case, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than such annual
compensation and employee benefits provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, (i) Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose
employment terminates during the one (1) year period following the Effective
Time with severance benefits at levels no less than and pursuant to the terms
of the Companys severance policies as set forth on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, but in no event more than ten (10) weeks
severance shall be paid and (ii) such severance benefits shall be determined
taking into account the service crediting provisions set forth in _Section
5.11(b)_.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of severance and other benefits based upon credited
service, but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accrual) under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to
any Company Employee after the Effective Time (including any Company Plans
that are continued) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such service was credited to him or her under the terms of
a corresponding Company Plan before the Effective Time, in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause any pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



50 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, other
than the Companys 2013 Annual Incentive Compensation Plan for Management
attached hereto as part of _Section 5.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _2013 MIP_ ") to the extent such Company Plans, arrangements and
agreements are set forth on  _Section 5.11_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. In addition, upon the earlier of (i) a Company Employees employment
being terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company other than for
"cause" or (ii) March 15, 2014, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to pay to each such Company Employee (other than a
Company Employee listed on _Section 8.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) a pro-rata portion of any bonus in respect of the 2013 performance
year that such Company Employee would have been entitled to receive under the
2013 MIP accrued for the period from January 1, 2013 through the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither any Company Employee listed on _Section
8.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule nor any Company Employee who
voluntarily leaves the employ of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, or whose employment is terminated for "cause", in each case
prior to March 15, 2014, shall be entitled to any portion of the bonus accrued
under the 2013 MIP. The parties hereto agree that, for purposes of this
_Section 5.11_, the Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in
control," "change of control" or "corporate transaction" under such Company
Plans, arrangements or agreements.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.11_ shall (i) be treated as the
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, policy or arrangement, (ii) subject to compliance with the
other provisions of this _Section 5.11_, alter or limit the ability of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their Affiliates to amend
or terminate any employee benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement (including any Company Plan and any New Plan) at any
time sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any of them, (iii) confer
upon any Person (including any current or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any Company Employee) any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment, or shall in any way limit the ability of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their affiliates to
terminate the employment of any employee (including any Company Employee) at
any time and for any or no reason, or (iv) confer upon any Person (including
any current or former Company employee, any Company Employee and any of their
respective dependents and beneficiaries) any rights as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. Parents current intention is to transition
Company Employees to the New Plans effective January 1, 2014.

Section 5.12  _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b)
cause Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.13 No _Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the

 



51  Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations. 

Section 5.14 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall each (a)
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and
(b) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to the
Transactions, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 

Section 5.15 _Reservation of Shares; Stock Exchange Listings_. Parent shall
(a) cause the shares of Parent Common stock to be issued in the Merger to be
reserved for issuance prior to the Closing Date and (b) use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common stock to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Company Common
Stock to be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

bylaws of the Corporation otherwise provide.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

 

SECTION 1\. _Elimination of Certain Liability of Directors_. A director of the
Corporation will not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except for liability (a) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for any acts or omissions not in
good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
law, (c) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (d) for any transaction from which
the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended
hereafter to authorize further elimination or limitation of the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation,
in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended. Any repeal
or modification of this section shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

SECTION 2\. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that the person is or was
a director or officer of the Corporation, or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation (as
defined in Section 145(i) of the DGCL) as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (as defined in Section 145(i) of the DGCL), both as to
action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
(as defined in Section 145(i) of the DGCL) and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such
proceeding to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to
the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The
indemnification granted pursuant to this SECTION 2 shall continue as to a

 



Exhibit A  Page 2  person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
a person. The right to indemnification conferred in this SECTION 2 shall be a
contract right. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors,
provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the
same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and
officers. For purposes of this SECTION 2, references to "the Corporation"
shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in
a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued,
would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this SECTION 2 with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

 

(b) _Advancement of Expenses_. The Corporation shall pay expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any
proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this SECTION
2. Such expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by former directors and
officers or other employees and agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon
such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation, by action of the Board
of Directors, may deem appropriate.

(c) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this SECTION 2 shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office.

 

(d) _Insurance_. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability
asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity,
or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability
under Section 145 of the DGCL.

ARTICLE VIII

AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

The Corporation reserves the right at any time from time to time to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of
Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of

ARTICLE II

MEETINGS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 1\. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of the stockholders for the
election of directors or for any other proper purpose will be held at such
place either within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors
may from time to time designate, as stated in the notice of such meeting or a
duly executed waiver of notice thereof. The Board of Directors may, in its
sole discretion, determine that any meeting not be held at any place, but may
instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to Section
211(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

Section 2\. _Annual Meeting_. Unless directors are elected by written consent
of stockholders in lieu of an annual meeting, an annual meeting of
stockholders will be held at such date and time as may be designated by the
Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. At such meeting,
the stockholders entitled to vote thereat will elect a Board of Directors
and may transact such other business as may be properly brought before the
meeting.

Section 3\. _Special Meetings_. Unless otherwise provided by law or the
certificate of incorporation of the corporation (as amended or restated from
time to time, the "Certificate of Incorporation"), special meetings of
stockholders may be called by the Chief Executive Officer or the President,
and will be called by the Secretary at the request, in writing, of either a
majority of the Board of Directors or stockholders owning outstanding shares
of capital stock of the corporation entitled to cast ten percent (10%) or
more of the votes that could be cast at such meeting. Such request will state
the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.

Section 4\. _Notice of Annual or Special Meeting_. Unless otherwise required
by law, written or printed notice stating the location, day and hour of the
meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which
the meeting is called, must be delivered either personally or by mail, by or
at the direction of the Secretary to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at such meeting, not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days
before the date of the meeting, in accordance with Article VIII of these
Bylaws.

 



Exhibit A  Page 5 Section 5\. _Business at Special Meeting_. The business transacted at any
special meeting of the stockholders will be limited to the purpose or
purposes stated in the notice thereof.

Section 6.  _Quorum of Stockholders_. The holders of outstanding shares of
capital stock of the corporation entitled to cast a majority of the votes that
could be cast at any meeting of stockholders, represented in person or by
proxy, will constitute a quorum at such meeting for the transaction of
business. When a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority
of the outstanding shares of each such class or classes, represented in person
or by proxy, will constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to
that vote on that matter.

Section 7\. _Adjournment_. At any meeting of stockholders, if less than a
quorum is present, the holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of the
corporation entitled to cast a majority of the votes that could be cast by the
holders of capital stock then present in person or by proxy will have
the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice other than
announcement at the meeting until a quorum is present. Any business may be
transacted at the adjourned meeting that might have been transacted at the
meeting originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30)
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date (as provided for in
Article IX, Section 5 of these Bylaws) is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a
notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting.

Section 8\. _Act of Stockholders_. Directors will be elected by a plurality
of the votes cast by holders of shares of capital stock of the corporation
outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of directors represented in
person or by proxy at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present,
and all elections of directors must be by written ballot. Any other action or
matter that is approved by a majority of the votes cast by holders of shares
of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and entitled to vote on such
action or matter, represented in person or by proxy at a meeting at which a
quorum is present, will be the act of the stockholders, unless a higher
proportion of such votes is required by law or the Certificate
of Incorporation. When a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a
majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes and represented in
person or by proxy, will be the act of such class.

 

Section 9\. _Proxies_. At any meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder
having the right to vote will be entitled to vote either in person or by
proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or by his duly authorized
attorney-in-fact. No proxy will be valid after one (1) year from its date of
execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Each proxy will
be revocable unless expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and the
proxy is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
proxy or otherwise made irrevocable by law. Proxies must be filed with the
secretary of the meeting, or of any adjournment thereof, before being voted.
Except as otherwise provided by a proxy, proxies will not be valid after final
adjournment of such meeting. A proxy with respect to stock held in the name of
two or more persons will be valid if executed by any one of them unless at or
prior to its exercise the corporation receives a specific written notice to
the contrary from any one of them. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on
behalf of a stockholder will be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to
its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity will rest on the
challenger.

Section 10.  _Voting List_. At least ten (10) days before each meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at each such
meeting or in any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with
the address of and the number of shares of each class of capital stock held
by each, will be prepared by the Secretary or the officer or agent having
charge of the stock transfer ledger of the corporation. Such list will be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for such ten (10) day period at the
principal executive office of the corporation. Such list will also be produced
and kept open at the time and place of 

 



Exhibit A  Page 6  the meeting. The stock ledger will be the only evidence as to who are the
stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders.

 

Section 11\. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Any action that may
be taken at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if a consent in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by all of the holders of
outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Every written consent
will bear the date of signatures of each stockholder and no written consent
will be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days after the earliest dated consent, written consents
signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to
the Secretary. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent will be given to those
stockholders who did not consent in writing.

Section 12\. _Presiding Officer and Conduct of Meetings_. The Chairman of the
Board will preside at all meetings of the stockholders and will automatically
serve as chairman of such meetings. In the absence of the Chairman of the
Board, the Board of Directors may elect a person to act as chairman at such
meeting. In the absence of the Chairman of the Board, and if the Board of
Directors fails to elect a chairman, then the President will preside at the
meeting of the stockholders and will automatically be the chairman of such
meeting, unless and until a different person is elected by a majority of the
shares entitled to vote at such meeting. The Secretary will act as secretary
at all meetings of the stockholders. In the absence or disability of the
Secretary, an Assistant Secretary (if one has been elected) appointed by the
chairman of the meeting will act as secretary at such meetings and in the
absence or disability of an Assistant Secretary, the chairman of the meeting
will appoint another person to act as secretary at such meetings.

 

Section 13\. _Inspectors_. The Board of Directors may, in advance of any
meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such
meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any of the inspectors so appointed fail
to appear or act, or if inspectors have not been appointed, the chairman of
the meeting must appoint one or more inspectors. The inspectors will
determine the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation
outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of votes represented at
the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies,
and will receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all
challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count
and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the results, and do
such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all
stockholders. On request of the chairman of the meeting, the inspectors will
make a report in writing of any challenge, request or matter determined by
them and will execute a certificate of any fact found by them. No director
or candidate for the office of director may act as an inspector of an
election of directors.

ARTICLE III

 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 1\. _Powers_. The business and affairs of the corporation will be
managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such

Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised and done
by the stockholders.

 

Section 2\. _Compensation of Directors_. As specifically prescribed from time
to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, directors may be paid their
expenses of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be
paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a
stated compensation for their services in their capacity as directors. This
provision will not

 



Exhibit A  Page 7  preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may
be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

Section 3\. _Chairman of the Board_. The Board of Directors, at its first
meeting after each annual meeting of stockholders, may elect one of its

duties as usually pertain to such position or as may be delegated by the
Board of Directors.

Section 4\. _Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships_. Vacancies and newly
created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, and the directors so elected will hold office
for the unexpired term of their predecessor in office until the next annual
meeting and until their successors are elected and have qualified. A vacancy
will be deemed to exist by reason of the death, resignation or removal from
office of any director. 

Section 5\. _Resignation; Removal_. Any director may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Board of Directors. Any such resignation
will take effect as of its date unless some other date is specified therein,
in which event it will be effective as of that date. The acceptance of such
resignation will not be necessary to make it effective. The holders of shares
of capital stock of the corporation having the right to cast a majority of the
votes that could be cast in an election of directors may remove any director
or the entire Board of Directors, with or without cause, either by a vote at
a special meeting or annual meeting, or by written consent.

ARTICLE IV

 

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD

Section 1\. _First Meeting_. The first meeting of each newly-elected Board of

stockholders and no notice of such meeting will be necessary to the newly-
elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a
quorum is present.

be held with or without notice at such time and at such place either within
or without the State of Delaware as from time to time is prescribed by the
Board of Directors.

special meetings of the Board of Directors must be given to each director at
least 24 hours before the time of the meeting.

meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of
notice of such meeting.

 

Section 5\. _Quorum of Directors_. A majority of the Board of Directors will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a greater number
is required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum is not
present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present
thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.

 



Exhibit A  Page 8 Section 6\. _Act of Meeting of the Board of Directors_. The act of a majority
of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be
the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is
required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation.

 

Section 7\. _Action by Unanimous Written Consent Without a Meeting_. Any
action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of
Directors may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth
the action so taken is signed by all members of the Board of Directors and
such consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board
of Directors. Such consent will have the same force and effect as a unanimous
vote of the Board of Directors.

ARTICLE V 

COMMITTEES

The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board
of Directors, may designate from among its members an executive committee and
one or more other committees, each of which, to the extent provided in such
resolution, will have and may exercise all the authority of the Board of
Directors, subject to the limitations imposed by applicable law. The Board of
Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board
of Directors, may designate one or more of its members as alternate members
of any committee, who may, subject to any limitations imposed by the Board of
Directors, replace absent or disqualified members at any meeting of that
committee. Vacancies in the membership of any such committee will be filled
by resolution adopted by the majority of the full Board of Directors at a
regular or special meeting of the Board. All committees will keep regular
minutes of their proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors
when required. To the extent applicable, the provisions of Article IV of these
Bylaws governing the meetings of the Board of Directors will likewise govern
the meetings of any committee thereof. Any member of the executive committee
or any other committee may be removed by the Board of Directors by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the full Board of Directors, whenever, in
its judgment, the best interests of the corporation will be served thereby. 

ARTICLE VI

DIRECTORS ACTION BY USE OF CONFERENCE TELEPHONE

Members of the Board of Directors or members of any committee designated by
such Board of Directors may participate in and hold a meeting of such Board of
Directors or committee by conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in such a meeting will constitute presence in
person at such meeting, except when a person participates in the meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

OFFICERS

 

Section 1\. _Executive Officers_. The officers of the corporation will consist
of a President and a Secretary and may also include a Chief Executive

will hold office until his successor is chosen and qualified or until his

written notice to the corporation. Any officer or agent may be removed by the
Board of Directors, with or without cause, but such removal will be without
prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. Election
or appointment of an officer or agent will not of itself create contract
rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation by death,
resignation, removal or otherwise will be filled by the Board of Directors.

Section 5\. _Chief Executive Officer_. The Chief Executive Officer will,
subject to the oversight and the direction of the Board of Directors, be the

Board of Directors shall elect different persons to be Chief Executive Officer
and President, any person that is elected to be President shall also be
deemed to have been elected to be Chief Executive Officer.

 

Section 6\. _President_. The President will, subject to the oversight and the
direction of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (if other

management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and will see that
all orders and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried into effect.
The President will have such other powers and duties as usually pertain to
such office or as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors. The President,
or such other officer or agent of the corporation to which the President may
delegate such power, will execute bonds, mortgages, instruments, contracts,
agreements and other documentation. Unless the Board of Directors shall elect
different persons to be Chief Executive Officer and President, any person that
is elected to be Chief Executive Officer shall also be deemed to have been
elected to be President.

Section 7\. _Vice Presidents_. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors, the Vice Presidents, in the order of their seniority as such
seniority may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors, will
perform the duties and exercise the powers of the President in the absence or
disability of the President. They will perform such other duties and have such
other powers as the Board of Directors or the President may from time to time
prescribe.

 

Section 8\. _Secretary_. The Secretary will attend all meetings of the
stockholders and all meetings of the Board of Directors, will record all the
proceedings of the meetings of the stockholders and of the Board of Directors
in books to be kept for that purpose, and will perform like duties for the
standing committees when required. The Secretary will give, or cause to
be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of
the Board of Directors, and will perform such other duties as may be
prescribed by the Board of Directors or the President. The Secretary will keep
in safe custody the seal of the corporation, and, when authorized by the
Board of Directors, affix the same to any instrument requiring it. When so
affixed, such seal will be attested by his or her signature or by the
signature of an Assistant Secretary.

 



Exhibit A  Page 10 Section 9\. _Assistant Secretaries_. Unless otherwise determined by the Board
of Directors, the Assistant Secretaries, in the order of their seniority as
such seniority may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors,
will perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Secretary in the
absence or disability of the Secretary. They will perform such other duties
and have such other powers as the Board of Directors, the President or the
Secretary may from time to time prescribe.

Section 10\. _Chief Financial Officer_. The Chief Financial Officer will have
the custody of the corporate funds and securities and will keep full and
accurate accounts of receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the
corporation and will deposit all moneys and other valuable effects in the name
and to the credit of the corporation in such depositories as may be designated
by the Board of Directors or the President. The Treasurer will disburse the
funds of the corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors or the
President, taking proper vouchers for such disbursements, and will perform
such other duties and have such other powers as usually pertain to the office
of treasurer or as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or the
President from time to time.

Section 11.  _Assistant Treasurer_. Unless otherwise determined by the Board
of Directors, the Assistant Treasurer will perform the duties and exercise the
powers of the Chief Financial Officer in the absence or disability of the
Chief Financial Officer. The Assistant Treasurer will perform such other
duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors, the President or
the Chief Financial Officer may from time to time prescribe.

 

Section 12\. _Officers  Bond_. If required by the Board of Directors, any
officer will give the corporation a bond, which must be renewed as the Board
of Directors may require, in such sum and with such surety or sureties as may
be satisfactory to the Board of Directors for the faithful performance of the
duties of his or her office and for the restoration to the corporation, in
case of his or her death, resignation, retirement or removal from office, of
any and all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind
in his or her possession or under his or her control belonging to
the corporation.

ARTICLE VIII

NOTICES

Section 1\. _Methods of Giving Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be
given to any stockholder or director under the provisions of any law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, it must be given in writing and
delivered personally or mailed to such stockholder or director at
such address as appears on the books of the corporation, and such notice will
be deemed to be given two (2) business days after the day the same is
deposited in the United States mail with sufficient postage thereon prepaid.
To the extent provided in Section 4 of this Article VIII, notice to
stockholders and directors may also be given by any form of communication, not
directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record
that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that
may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an
automated process ("electronic transmission").

Section 2\. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given to
any stockholder or director under the provisions of any law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the
person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, will be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.

 

Section 3\. _Attendance as Waiver_. Attendance of a stockholder or director at
a meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a
stockholder or director attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
on the

 



Exhibit A  Page 11  ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, a meeting need be specified
in any written waiver.

 

Section 4\. _Electronic Transmission_. Without limiting the manner by which
notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders and directors, any
notice to stockholders or directors given by the corporation under any
provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (except as otherwise
provided below), the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws will
be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by
the stockholder or director to whom the notice is given. Any such consent will
be revocable by the stockholder or director by written notice to the
corporation. Any such consent will be deemed revoked if (a) the corporation
is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices
given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or to the
transfer agent of the corporation, or other person responsible for the giving
of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability
as a revocation will not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given
by electronic transmission will be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile
telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the recipient has
consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to
an electronic mail address at which the recipient has consented to receive
notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate
notice to the recipient of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other
form of electronic transmission, when directed to the recipient. An affidavit
of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other
agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of
electronic transmission will, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence
of the facts stated therein. Notice to stockholders may not be given by
electronic transmission if such notice is given pursuant to Sections 164,
296, 311, 312 and 324 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE IX

 

CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES

Section 1\. _Certificates Representing Shares_. The corporation will deliver
certificates representing all shares to which stockholders are entitled. Such
certificates will be numbered, entered in the books of the corporation as
they are issued and will be signed by the Chief Executive Officer, the
President or a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary,
and may be sealed with the seal of the corporation or a facsimile thereof.
Any or all signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any
officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such
certificate has ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued,
it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were
such officer at the date of its issuance. If the corporation is authorized to
issue shares of more than one class, there will be set forth upon the face or
back of the certificate a statement that the corporation will furnish to any
stockholder upon request and without charge a full statement of all of the
powers, designations, preferences, limitations and relative, participating,
optional, or other special rights of the shares of each class authorized to
be issued and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such
preferences and/or rights and, if the corporation is authorized to issue any
preferred or special class in series, the variations in the relative rights
and preferences between the shares of each such series so far as the same have
been fixed and determined and the authority of the Board of Directors to fix
and determine the relative rights and preferences of subsequent series.
Each certificate representing shares must state upon the face thereof that
the corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the name
of the person to whom issued, the number and the class and the designation of
the series, if any, that such certificate represents and the par value of
each share represented by such certificate or a statement that the shares are
without par value. No certificate may be issued for any share until the
consideration therefor has been fully paid. 

 



Exhibit A  Page 12 Section 2\. _Restriction on Transfer of Shares_. If any restriction on
the transfer, or registration of the transfer, of shares is imposed or agreed
to by the corporation, as permitted by law, the Certificate of Incorporation
or these Bylaws, such restriction must be noted conspicuously on the face or
back of each certificate representing shares in accordance with applicable
law.

Section 3\. _Transfer of Shares_. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of
this Article IX, upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of
the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by
proper evidence of succession, assignment, or authority to transfer, it will
be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction upon
its books. The corporation will not, however, be required to pay any tax that
may be payable in respect of any transfer of shares of capital stock of the
corporation, and no such transfer will be made or reflected on the books of
the corporation unless and until the person requesting such transfer has paid
to the corporation the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the
satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid.

 

Section 4\. _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificate_. The corporation may
issue a new certificate or certificates in place of any certificate or
certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed.
The corporation, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, may
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or
certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such
manner as it may require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as
it may direct to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be made
against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed or the issuance of such new certificate.

Section 5\. _Fixing Record Date_. For the purpose of determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any
other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix a date as the record
date for any such determination of stockholders, such date to not precede the
date of adoption of the resolution fixing the record date, and such date to be
not more than sixty (60) days, and, in case of a meeting of stockholders, not
less than ten (10) days, prior to the date on which the particular action
requiring such determination of stockholders is to be taken. If no record date
is fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, or to
vote at, a meeting of stockholders, the close of business on the day next
preceding the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or, if notice is
waived, the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held will be the record date for such determination of
stockholders. If no record date is fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive payment of a dividend or other distribution, or for any
other proper purpose, the close of business on the day on which the
resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend or relating to
such other proper purpose is adopted will be the record date for such
