of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or default, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or permit
termination of any of the Company Insurance Policies. No written notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the Company with respect to any such Company Insurance Policy other than as is customary in connection with renewals of
existing Company Insurance Policies. Set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;3.21</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a true and complete list of all currently outstanding claims made by the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Company Insurance
Policies. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has failed to timely report any claim under a Company Insurance Policy, except where such failure to timely report would not result in a material liability. There has been no reservation of

address as appears on the books of the corporation, and such notice will be deemed to be given two (2)&nbsp;business days after the day the same is deposited in the United States mail with sufficient postage thereon prepaid. To the extent provided
in Section&nbsp;4 of this Article VIII, notice to stockholders and directors may also be given by any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and

stockholders and directors, any notice to stockholders or directors given by the corporation under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (except as otherwise provided below), the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws will be
effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder or director to whom the notice is given. Any such consent will be revocable by the stockholder or director by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent
will be deemed revoked if (a)&nbsp;the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2)&nbsp;consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (b)&nbsp;such inability becomes known to the Secretary

action. Notice given by electronic transmission will be deemed given: (1)&nbsp;if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the recipient has consented to receive notice; (2)&nbsp;if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the recipient has consented to receive notice; (3)&nbsp;if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the recipient of such specific posting, upon the later of (A)&nbsp;such posting and
(B)&nbsp;the giving of such separate notice; and (4)&nbsp;if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the recipient. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;1. <U>Certificates Representing Shares</U>. The corporation will deliver certificates representing all shares to which stockholders are entitled. Such certificates will be numbered, entered
in the books of the corporation as they are issued and will be signed by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, and may be sealed with the seal of the corporation or a
facsimile thereof. Any or all signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate has ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it
may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its issuance. If the corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one class, there will be set forth upon the face or back of the
certificate a statement that the corporation will furnish to any stockholder upon request and without charge a full statement of all of the powers, designations, preferences, limitations and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights
of the shares of each class authorized to be issued and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights and, if the corporation is authorized to issue any preferred or special class in series, the variations in the
relative rights and preferences between the shares of each such series so far as the same have been fixed and determined and the authority of the Board of Directors to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of subsequent series. Each
certificate representing shares must state upon the face thereof that the corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the name of the person to whom issued, the number and the class and the designation of the series, if any,
that such certificate represents and the par value of each share represented by such certificate or a statement that the shares are without par value. No certificate may be issued for any share until the consideration therefor has been fully paid.

transfer, it will be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction upon its books. The corporation will not, however, be required to pay any tax that may
be payable in respect of any transfer of shares of capital stock of the corporation, and no such transfer will be made or reflected on the books of the corporation unless and until the person requesting such transfer has paid to the corporation the
amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid. </FONT></P>

any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed. The
corporation, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, may require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it may require and/or to give
the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed or the issuance of such new

a date as the record date for any such determination of stockholders, such date to not precede the date of adoption of the resolution fixing the record date, and such date to be not more than sixty (60)&nbsp;days, and, in case of a meeting of
stockholders, not less than ten (10)&nbsp;days, prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of stockholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, or
to vote at, a meeting of stockholders, the close of business on the day next preceding the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or, if notice is waived, the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held
will be the record date for such determination of stockholders. If no record date is fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or other distribution, or for any other proper purpose, the close of business
on the day on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend or relating to such other proper purpose is adopted will be the record date for such determination of stockholders. When a determination of stockholders entitled to
vote at any meeting of stockholders has been made as provided in this Section&nbsp;5, such determination will apply to any adjournment thereof; provided that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. </FONT></P>
