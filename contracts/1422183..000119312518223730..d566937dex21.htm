-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 22, 2018 (this " _Agreement_
"), among Corporate Capital Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _CCT_ "),
FS Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" _FSIC_ "), IC
Acquisition, Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned direct Consolidated
Subsidiary of FSIC (" _Merger Sub_ ") and FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the " _Joint Advisor_ ").

RECITALS

 

A. Each of CCT and FSIC has previously elected to be regulated as a Business
Development Company (" _BDC_ "), as defined in Section 2(a)(48) of the
Investment Company Act, and the Joint Advisor is the investment adviser of
each of CCT and FSIC;

B. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
CCT, FSIC and Merger Sub intend to merge Merger Sub with and into CCT (the "
_Merger_ "), with CCT as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ").

C. Immediately after the Merger, the Surviving Company shall merge with and
into FSIC (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together with the Merger, the "
_Mergers_ "), with FSIC as the surviving company in the Second Merger.

 

D. The Board of Directors of CCT, including all of the Independent Directors
of CCT, has unanimously (other than Todd Builione, who recused himself) (i)
determined that (x) this Agreement and the terms of the Mergers and the
related Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of CCT and (y)
the interests of CCTs existing stockholders will not be diluted as a result
of the Transactions and (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions.

E. The Board of Directors of FSIC, including all of the Independent Directors
of FSIC, has unanimously (i) determined that (x) this Agreement and the terms
of the Mergers and the related Transactions are advisable and in the best
interests of FSIC and (y) the interests of FSICs existing stockholders will
not be diluted as a result of the Transactions and (ii) approved this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

F. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub and FSIC, acting in FSICs capacity as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the
Transactions.

G. The parties intend the Mergers to be treated as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
and intend for this Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of the Code. H. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements in connection with the Transactions and also to
prescribe certain conditions to the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

1.1  _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into CCT, and the
separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease. CCT shall be the
surviving company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a
corporation under the Laws of the State of Maryland.

 

1.2 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Dechert LLP, 2929 Arch Street,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, on the date that is five (5) Business Days
after the satisfaction or waiver of the latest to occur of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions), unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties to this
Agreement (the " _Closing Date_ ").

1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed with,
and accepted for record by, the State Department of Assessments and Taxation
of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ ") on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_
" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in
the Articles of Merger.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the MGCL.

 

1.5 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of CCT, FSIC or Merger Sub or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Company.

 



2 (b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of CCT (the "
_CCT Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are owned by FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of FSIC (the " _FSIC
Common Stock_ ") or any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor (such shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(e)_, each share of CCT Common Stock, except
for the Cancelled Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Article II_ , into the right to receive a number of
shares of FSIC Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 

(d) All of the shares of CCT Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Article I_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each such share of CCT Common Stock, all of which
are in non-certificated book-entry form, shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which such shares of CCT Common Stock represented in non-certificated
book-entry form have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_.

 

(e) The Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted (to the extent not
already taken into account in determining the Closing CCT Net Asset Value
and/or the Closing FSIC Net Asset Value, as applicable) to account for the Tax
Dividend or if, between the Determination Date and the Effective Time, the
respective outstanding shares of FSIC Common Stock or CCT Common Stock shall
have been increased or decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, or if a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be authorized and declared with a record date within such
period. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(e)_ shall be construed to permit
any party hereto to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted
by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

1.6 _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. The charter of Merger Sub
and the bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the charter and the bylaws of the Surviving
Company as of the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the respective terms of such charter and bylaws,
as applicable.

1.7 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until
the next annual meeting of the Surviving Company and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualify, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal. The directors and officers of FSIC immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of FSIC immediately after
consummation of the Second Merger and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualify, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

 



3 1.8 _Effect on FSIC Common Stock_. Each share of FSIC Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding.

1.9 _Merger of Surviving Company_. Immediately after the occurrence of
the Effective Time and in accordance with the MGCL, Surviving Company shall
merge with and into FSIC and the separate corporate existence of the Surviving
Company shall cease. FSIC shall be the surviving company in the Second Merger
and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the Laws of the State
of Maryland.

ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1  _Delivery of Evidence of FSIC Common Stock_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, FSIC shall deposit with its transfer
agent evidence of book-entry shares representing FSIC Common Stock issuable
as Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_.

2.2 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of FSIC Common Stock shall be
issued upon the conversion of CCT Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.5(c)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of FSIC Common Stock. Each
holder of shares of CCT Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of FSIC
Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in
an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of FSIC
Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the volume-weighted average trading price of a
share of FSIC Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ")
for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the third (3rd) trading
day preceding the Closing Date (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or its successor
or, if not reported thereon, another authoritative source selected by FSIC
that is reasonably acceptable to CCT). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
2.2_, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled
shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal
places.

2.3 _Paying and Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, FSIC shall
appoint FSICs transfer agent or other bank or trust company to act as
exchange agent (the " _Paying and Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder, pursuant to an
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to each of FSIC and CCT. Following
the Effective Time, FSIC shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying and Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate cash for
fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. Any cash deposited
with the Paying and Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

 



4 2.4 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Each holder of record of shares of CCT Common Stock (other than the
Cancelled Shares) in book-entry form that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_ and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of FSIC Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, shall, promptly after the Effective Time, be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
FSIC Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose other than the purposes provided for in the immediately preceding
sentence.

(b) Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws, following the Effective Time, the record holder of shares (other than
Cancelled Shares) of CCT Common Stock at the Effective Time shall be entitled
to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to the whole shares of FSIC Common Stock represented by such
shares of CCT Common Stock and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
the whole shares of FSIC Common Stock represented by such shares of CCT Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender
date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of FSIC Common Stock
issuable with respect to such shares of CCT Common Stock.

2.5 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid by FSIC in
accordance with the terms of _Article I_ and _Article II_ shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to CCT Common
Stock in respect of which such Merger Consideration was paid. From and after
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of CCT shall be closed, and there
shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of CCT of the shares
of CCT Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

2.6 _Net Asset Value Calculation_.

 

(a) CCT shall deliver to FSIC a calculation of the net asset value of CCT as
of a date mutually agreed between FSIC and CCT, such date to be no earlier
than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (such agreed date, the "
_Determination Date_ "), calculated in good faith as of such date and based on
the same assumptions and methodologies, and applying the same categories of
adjustments to net asset value (except as may be mutually agreed by the
parties), used in preparing the calculation of the net asset value of CCT set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ of the CCT Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Closing CCT Net Asset Value_ "); _provided_ that CCT shall update the
calculation of the Closing CCT Net Asset Value in the event that the Closing
is subsequently materially delayed or there is a material change to
the Closing CCT Net Asset Value prior to the Closing; _provided_ _further_
that the Board of Directors of CCT shall be required to approve, and the Joint
Advisor shall certify in writing to FSIC, the calculation of the Closing CCT
Net Asset Value.

 



5 (b) FSIC shall deliver to CCT a calculation of the net asset value of FSIC as
of the Determination Date, calculated in good faith as of such date and based
on the same assumptions and methodologies, and applying the same categories of
adjustments to net asset value (except as may be mutually agreed by the
parties), used in preparing the calculation of the net asset value of FSIC
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ of the FSIC Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Closing FSIC Net Asset Value_ "); _provided_ that FSIC shall update
the calculation of the Closing FSIC Net Asset Value in the event that the
Closing is subsequently materially delayed or there is a material change to
the Closing FSIC Net Asset Value prior to the Closing; _provided_ _further_
that the Board of Directors of FSIC shall be required to approve, and the
Joint Advisor shall certify in writing to CCT, the calculation of the Closing
FSIC Net Asset Value.

 

(c) In connection with preparing the calculations provided pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, each of CCT and FSIC will use the portfolio valuation
methods approved by its respective Board of Directors for valuing the
securities and other assets of CCT or FSIC, as applicable, as of June 30,
2018.

 

(d) The Joint Advisor agrees to give each of FSIC and CCT and its respective
Representatives, upon reasonable request, reasonable access to the
individuals who have prepared each calculation provided pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_ and to the information, books, records, work papers and
back-up materials used or useful in preparing each such calculation,
including without limitation any reports prepared by valuation agents, in
order to assist such party with its review of such calculation so long as such
individual remains employed by the Joint Advisor or its Affiliates.

2.7 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to stockholders of CCT as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time may be paid to FSIC, upon FSICs written demand to the
Paying and Exchange Agent. In such event, any former stockholders of CCT who
have not theretofore complied with any applicable requirements to receive
cash in lieu of fractional shares of FSIC Common Stock shall thereafter look
only to FSIC with respect to such cash in lieu of fractional shares, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of FSIC, CCT, the
Surviving Company, Merger Sub, the Paying and Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of CCT Common Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

2.8 _Withholding Rights_. FSIC or the Paying and Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of CCT Common Stock such amounts as
it determines in good faith are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the recipient.

against CCT with respect to its ownership interest in SCJV.

 



8 3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) CCT has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have been duly and
validly approved by the Board of Directors of CCT, including all of the
Independent Directors of CCT. The Board of Directors of CCT, including all of
the Independent Directors of CCT, has unanimously (other than Todd Builione,
who recused himself) determined that this Agreement and the terms of the
Mergers and the related Transactions are advisable and in the best interests
of CCT, determined that the interests of CCTs existing stockholders will not
be diluted as a result of the Transactions, has approved the CCT Matters and
has directed that the CCT Matters be submitted to CCTs stockholders for
approval at a duly held meeting of such stockholders (the " _CCT Stockholders
Meeting_ ") and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
on the matter by the holders of outstanding shares of CCT Common Stock to
approve the CCT Matters at a duly held meeting of such stockholders (the "
_CCT Requisite Vote_ "), the Merger and the other Transactions have been
authorized by all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by CCT and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by FSIC and Merger Sub) constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of CCT, enforceable against CCT in accordance with its
terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to
general principles of equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ")).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by CCT, nor
the consummation by CCT of the Transactions, nor performance of this
Agreement by CCT, will (i) violate any provision of the CCT Charter or the CCT
Bylaws, or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to
in  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ are duly obtained and/or
made, (A) violate any Law or Order applicable to CCT, any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries or (B) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of or the loss
of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event that, with or without
the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default)
under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation
under, accelerate the performance required by, require the consent, approval
or authorization of, or notice to or filing with any third-party with respect
to, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Permit, Contract or other
obligation to which CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets is bound
except, with respect to clause (ii)(B), any such violation, conflict, breach,
loss, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, consent, approval or
creation that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ of the CCT Disclosure Schedule sets forth, to
CCTs knowledge, any material consent fees payable to a third party in
connection with the Merger.

 



9 3.4 _Governmental Consents_. No consents or approvals of, or filings or
registrations with, any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with
the consummation by CCT of the Merger and the other Transactions, except for

of this Agreement on a Current Report on Form 8-K and (vi) any such consents,
approvals, filings or registrations that the failure to obtain or make would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on CCT.

 

3.5 _Reports_.

reports and documents that it was required to file since January 1, 2015 (the
" _Applicable Date_ ") with the SEC (such filings since the Applicable Date,
the " _CCT SEC Reports_ "). No CCT SEC Report, at the time filed or furnished
with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. As of their respective dates, all CCT SEC Reports

cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party
to any Contract, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is
a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, any Governmental
Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its
business (or to CCTs knowledge that, upon consummation of the Merger, would
restrict in any material respect the conduct of the business of FSIC or any of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries), or that in any material manner relates to its
capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit, risk management
or compliance policies, its internal controls, its management or its business,
other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated BDCs

balance sheet of CCT as of March 31, 2018 included in the unaudited financial

any commitment to become a party to any off-balance sheet joint venture,
partnership or similar contract with any unconsolidated Affiliate or "off-

Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of CCT, any director, officer, auditor,

has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of CCT

of the Exchange Act), and (ii) no attorney representing CCT or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by CCT or any of

contained in any such certifications are complete and correct, and CCT is
otherwise in compliance with all applicable effective provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(h) CCT has in all material respects:

 

(i) designed and maintained a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by CCT in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to CCTs management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
allow CCTs principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports;

 



12 (ii) designed and maintained a system of internal controls over
financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance concerning the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including reasonable assurance
that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations, (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for assets, (C) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization, (D) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences and (E) CCTs management, with the participation of CCTs
principal executive and financial officers, has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of CCTs internal controls over financial reporting for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 in compliance with the requirements of

CCTs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017;

 

(iii) (A) disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to its auditors and
the audit committee of the Board of Directors of CCT (1) any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses (as defined in the relevant Statement of
Auditing Standards) in the design or operation of CCTs internal controls over

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (2) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other individuals
who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial reporting
and (B) identified for CCTs auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls; and

(iv) provided to FSIC true, complete and correct copies of any of the
foregoing disclosures to its auditors or the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of CCT that have been made in writing from the Applicable Date
through the date hereof, and will promptly provide to FSIC true, complete and
correct copies of any such disclosures that are made after the date hereof.

13 (j) To CCTs knowledge, there are no fraud or suspected fraud affecting CCT
involving management of CCT or employees of the Joint Advisor who have

(a) CCT and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is in compliance, and has
been operated in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
Laws, including, if and to the extent applicable, the Investment Company Act,
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act other than as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to CCT. CCT has not received any written or, to CCTs knowledge,
oral notification from a Governmental Entity of any material non-compliance
with any applicable Laws, which non-compliance would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. CCT has operated in compliance with all
listing standards of the NYSE since CCT Common Stock began trading on the
NYSE on November 14, 2017 other than as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. CCT is not subject to any "stop order" and
is, and was, fully qualified to sell shares of CCT Common Stock in each
jurisdiction in which such shares were registered and sold, other than as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to CCT.

(b) CCT is in compliance, and since it commenced operations, has complied
with its investment policies and restrictions and portfolio valuation methods,
if any, as such policies and restrictions have been set forth in its
registration statement (as amended from time to time) or reports that it has
filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act and applicable Laws, if any, other
than any non-compliance that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CCT.

 



14 (c) CCT has written policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Rule 38a-1
under the Investment Company Act that are reasonably designed to prevent
material violations of the "Federal Securities Laws," as such term is defined
in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under the Investment Company Act. There have been no
"Material Compliance Matters" for CCT, as such term is defined in Rule
38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment Company Act, other than those that have been
reported to CCTs Board of Directors and satisfactorily remedied or are in the
process of being remedied or those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) CCT and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries holds and is in compliance
with all Permits required in order to permit CCT and each of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries to own or lease their properties and assets and to conduct their
businesses under and pursuant to all applicable Law as presently
conducted, other than any failure to hold or non-compliance with any such
Permit that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. All such Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. CCT has
not received any written or, to CCTs knowledge, oral notification from a
Governmental Entity of any material non-compliance with any such Permits, and
no Proceeding is pending or threatened in writing to suspend, cancel, modify,
revoke or materially limit any such Permits, which Proceeding would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(e) No "affiliated person" (as defined under the Investment Company Act) of
CCT has been subject to disqualification to serve in any capacity
contemplated by the Investment Company Act for any investment company
(including a BDC) under Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment Company Act,
unless, in each case, such Person has received exemptive relief from the SEC
with respect to any such disqualification. There is no material Proceeding
pending and served or, to the knowledge of CCT, threatened that would result
in any such disqualification.

 

(f) The minute books and other similar records of CCT contain a true and
complete record in all material respects of all action taken at all meetings
and by all written consents in lieu of meetings of the stockholders of CCT,
the Board of Directors of CCT and any committees of the Board of Directors of
CCT.

 

3.10 _State Takeover Laws_. No restrictions on "business combinations" set
forth in any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "takeover" or
"interested stockholder" Law (any such laws, " _Takeover Statutes_ ") are
applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other Transactions.

 

3.11 _CCT Information_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
CCT for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC,
at any time the Registration Statement is amended or supplemented or at the
time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities

 



15  Act, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement is first
mailed to stockholders of CCT or stockholders of FSIC or at the time of the
CCT Stockholders Meeting or the FSIC Stockholders Meeting, in each case,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by CCT with respect to information supplied by FSIC, Merger
Sub or the Joint Advisor for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

3.12 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 

(a) CCT and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed
(taking into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such
Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects), has paid
all material Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all material Taxes that have been incurred or
are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local
taxing authorities other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or are being
contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have been
adequately reserved against under GAAP. No material Tax Return of CCT or any
Consolidated Subsidiary has been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the
" _IRS_ ") or other relevant taxing authority. There are no material disputes
pending, or written claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon CCT or any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for which CCT does not have reserves that are
adequate under GAAP. Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is
a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries). Within
the past five years (or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related
transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the
Merger is also a part), neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution of stock which qualified or was intended to qualify under Section
355(a) of the Code and to which Section 355 of the Code (or so much
of Section 356 of the Code, as it relates to Section 355 of the Code) applied
or was intended to apply. Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
is required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a)
of the Code, no such adjustment has been proposed by the IRS and no pending
request for permission to change any accounting method has been submitted by
CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries. Neither CCT nor any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). Within the past
seven years, if CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has participated
in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b), such entity has properly disclosed such transaction in
accordance with the applicable Tax regulations.



 



16 (b) CCT made a valid election under Part I of Subchapter M of Subtitle A,
Chapter 1, of the Code to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" (a "
_RIC_ "). CCT has qualified as a RIC at all times since 2011 and expects to
continue to so qualify through the Effective Time. No challenge to CCTs
status as a RIC is pending or has been threatened orally or in writing. For
each taxable year of CCT ending on or before the Effective Time, CCT has
satisfied the distribution requirements imposed on a regulated investment
company under Section 852 of the Code (assuming for these purposes that any
Tax Dividend declared by CCT after the date of this Agreement has been timely
paid).

(c) CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes and have, within the time and in the manner prescribed by applicable
Law, in all material respects, withheld from and paid over all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws.

(d) CCT is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(e) CCT has no "earnings and profits" for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
described in Section 852(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

 

(f) Section 3.12(f) of the CCT Disclosure Schedule lists each asset the
disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the
Code as prescribed in IRS Notice 88-19, 1988-1 C.B. 486, or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 and the amount of "net unrealized built-in
gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374(d) of the Code) on each such asset.
Other than such assets listed in Section 3.12(f) of the CCT Disclosure
Schedule, CCT is not now and will not be subject to corporate-level income
taxation on the sale, transfer or other disposition of its assets currently
held as a result of the application of Section 337(d) of the Code or the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(g) No claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns
that CCT or any such Consolidated Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction, and which, if upheld, would reasonably result in a
material Tax liability.

 

(h) Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has, or has ever had,
a permanent establishment in any country other than the United States.

(i) Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has requested a
private letter ruling from the IRS or comparable rulings from other taxing
authorities.

(j) Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has any liability for
the Taxes of another Person other than CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law), as a transferee, successor or payable pursuant to
a contractual obligation.

 



17 (k) Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has ever been a
member of a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group (other than such a
group the common parent of which is CCT or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries).

 

(l) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and
payable) upon any of the assets of CCT or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries.

3.13 _Litigation_. There are no material Proceedings pending or, to CCTs
knowledge, threatened against CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries.
There is no Order binding upon CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
other than such Orders as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.14 _Employee Matters_. Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
has (i) any employees or (ii) any "employee benefit plans" as defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, or any employment, bonus, incentive, vacation, stock option or other
equity based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit
sharing, fringe benefit, health, medical or other similar plan, program or
agreement (collectively, " _Employee Benefit Plans_ ").

 

3.15 _Certain Contracts_.

 

(a) CCT has Previously Disclosed a complete and accurate list of, and true and
complete copies have been delivered or made available (including via EDGAR)
to FSIC of, all Contracts (collectively, the " _CCT Material Contracts_ ") to
which, as of the date hereof, CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries may be bound,
or, to the knowledge of CCT, to which it or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries or their respective assets or properties may be subject, with
respect to:

 

(i) any Contract that is a "material contract" within the meaning of Item
601(b)(10) of the SECs Regulation S-K or that is material to CCT or its
financial condition or results of operations;

(ii) any loans or credit agreements, mortgages, indentures and other
agreements and instruments pursuant to which any Indebtedness of CCT or any of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$500,000 is outstanding or may be incurred, or any guarantee by CCT or any of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness in an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $500,000;

 

(iii) any Contract that creates future payment obligations in excess of
$250,000 and that by its terms does not terminate, or is not terminable upon
notice, without penalty within 90 days or less, or any Contract that creates
or would create a Lien on any asset of CCT or its Consolidated Subsidiaries
(other than Liens consisting of restrictions on transfer agreed to in respect
of investments entered into in the ordinary course of business or as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole);

 



18 (iv) except with respect to investments set forth in the CCT SEC Reports,
any partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other similar
Contract that is not entered into in the ordinary course of business and is
material to CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

 

(v) any non-competition or non-solicitation Contract or any other Contract
that limits, purports to limit, or would reasonably be expected to limit in
each case in any material respect the manner in which, or the localities in
which, any material business of CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, is or could be conducted or the types of business that CCT and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries conducts or may conduct;

 

(vi) any Contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any business
or operations (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise)
involving value in excess of $250,000 (individually or together with all
related Contracts) as to which there are any ongoing obligations or that was
entered into on or after the Applicable Date other than Contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business with respect to investments set forth
in the CCT SEC Reports;

(vii) any Contract that obligates CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
to conduct any business that is material to CCT and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on an exclusive basis with any third party, or
upon consummation of the Merger, will obligate FSIC, the Surviving Company or
any of their Consolidated Subsidiaries to conduct business with any third-
party on an exclusive basis; or

 

(viii) any Contract with a Governmental Entity.

 

(b) Each CCT Material Contract is (x) valid and binding on CCT or its
applicable Consolidated Subsidiary and, to CCTs knowledge, each other party
thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and (z) is in full force and effect other
than in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The investment advisory agreement between CCT
and the Joint Advisor has been approved by the Board of Directors and
stockholders of CCT in accordance with Section 15 of the Investment Company
Act. Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries nor, to CCTs
knowledge, any other party thereto, is in material breach of any provisions of
or in default (or, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would
be in default) under, and has not taken any action resulting in the
termination of, acceleration of performance required by, or resulting in a
right of termination or acceleration under, any CCT Material Contract
other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to CCT. No CCT
Material Contract has been amended, modified or

 



19  supplemented other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No event has occurred with respect to CCT or
any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries that, with or without the giving of
notice, the lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default under
any CCT Material Contract other than as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.16 _Insurance Coverage_. All material insurance policies maintained by CCT
or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and that name CCT or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as an insured (each, an " _CCT Insurance Policy_ "),
including the fidelity bond required by the Investment Company Act, are in
full force and effect and all premiums due and payable with respect to each
CCT Insurance Policy have been paid. Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries has received written notice of cancellation of any CCT Insurance
Policy.

3.17 _Intellectual Property_. CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries own,
possess or have a valid license or other adequate rights to use all patents,
patent applications, patent rights, trademarks, trademark applications,
trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, service marks, service mark
applications, service mark rights, copyrights, computer programs and other
proprietary intellectual property rights (collectively, " _Intellectual
Property Rights_ ") that are material to the conduct of the business of CCT
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole (hereinafter, " _CCT
Intellectual Property Rights_ "), except where the failure to own, possess or
have adequate rights would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. No claims are pending for which CCT has received written notice or,
to the knowledge of CCT, threatened (i) that CCT or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise violating the rights of any Person
with regard to any Intellectual Property Right, or (ii) that any CCT
Intellectual Property Right is invalid or unenforceable. To the knowledge of
CCT, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or using without
authorization the rights of CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property Right, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.18 _Environmental Matters_. There are no material Proceedings of any kind,
pending or, to the knowledge of CCT, threatened, against CCT or any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, arising under any Environmental Law. There are no
Orders by or with any Governmental Entity, imposing any material liability or
obligation on CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries under or in respect
of any Environmental Law. There are and have been no Hazardous Substances or
other conditions related thereto at any property owned or premises leased by
CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries during the period of CCTs or its
Consolidated Subsidiarys ownership or lease that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to CCT. None of CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries have
entered into any Contract to provide indemnification to any third party
pursuant to Environmental Laws in relation to any property previously owned by
CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries.

 



20 3.19 _Real Property_. Neither CCT nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
owns any real property. Section 3.19 of the CCT Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all real property leased by CCT or any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries (the " _Leased Real Property_ "). Neither CCT
nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has received written notice of any
pending or contemplated condemnation, expropriation or other Proceeding in
eminent domain affecting the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or
interest therein, except for such Proceedings as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither CCT nor any of its
Consolidated Subsidiaries has received any written notice that the current
use and occupancy of the Leased Real Property violates in any material respect
any easement, covenant, condition, restriction or similar provision in any
instrument of record or other unrecorded agreement affecting the Leased
Real Property, as applicable, other than such violations as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to CCT
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

3.20 _Investment Assets_. Each of CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries has
good title to all securities, Indebtedness and other financial instruments
owned by it, free and clear of any material Liens, except to the extent such
securities, Indebtedness or other financial instruments, as applicable, are
pledged to secure obligations of CCT or its Consolidated Subsidiaries set
forth in Section 3.20 of the CCT Disclosure Schedule and except for Liens
consisting of restrictions on transfer agreed to in respect of investments
entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this
Agreement, the value of investments owned by CCT that are "qualifying
investments" for purposes of Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act is
greater than 70% of the value of CCTs total assets (other than assets
described in Section 55(a)(7) of the Investment Company Act).

3.21 _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 3-202(c) of the MGCL and
pursuant to the CCT Charter, no appraisal rights shall be available to
holders of CCT Common Stock in connection with the Transactions.

3.22 _Valuation_. Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties, the value
of each investment asset owned by CCT that is used in connection with the
computations made by CCT pursuant to Section 2.6 will be determined in
accordance with the valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board
of Directors of CCT as of June 30, 2018 and set forth in CCTs compliance
policies and procedures and no exceptions to such valuation policies and
procedures have been or will be permitted in valuing such assets in
connection with the computations pursuant to Section 2.6 for purposes of this
Agreement, and the value of all assets owned by CCT other than investment
assets that are used in connection with the computations made by CCT
pursuant to Section 2.6 will be determined in accordance with GAAP. Except as
may be mutually agreed by the parties, all valuations made by third-party
valuation agents for such purposes will be made only by valuation agents that
have been approved by the Board of Directors of CCT as of June 30, 2018.
Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties, the fair value of any
portfolio securities for which fair value determinations were made by the
Board of Directors of CCT for purposes of such computations were or will be
determined by such Board of Directors in good faith in accordance with the
valuation methods set forth in CCTs valuation policies and procedures adopted
by its Board of Directors as of June 30, 2018.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FSIC

 

Except with respect to matters that have been Previously Disclosed, FSIC
hereby represents and warrants to CCT that:

of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties

ownership interests of each Consolidated Subsidiary of FSIC are owned by
FSIC, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Liens, and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (in respect of corporate entities) and free
of preemptive rights. No Consolidated Subsidiary of FSIC has or is bound by
any outstanding Rights calling for the purchase or issuance of, or the payment
of any amount based on, any shares of capital stock or any other equity

right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of such Consolidated Subsidiary.

 

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Each of FSIC and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions have been duly and validly approved by the
Boards of Directors of each of FSIC, including all of the Independent
Directors of FSIC, and Merger Sub. The Board of Directors of FSIC, including
all of the Independent Directors of FSIC, has unanimously determined that this
Agreement and the terms of the Mergers and the related Transactions are
advisable and in the best interests of FSIC, determined that the interests of
FSICs existing stockholders will not be diluted as a result of the
Transactions, has approved the FSIC Matters and has directed that the FSIC
Matters be submitted to FSICs stockholders for approval at a duly
held meeting of such stockholders (the " _FSIC Stockholders Meeting_ ") and
has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for receipt of the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the FSIC Matters at a duly
held 

 



23  meeting of such stockholders (the " _FSIC Requisite Vote_ "), the Merger and
the other Transactions have been authorized by all necessary corporate action.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by FSIC and
Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by CCT)
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of FSIC and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of FSIC and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms
(except as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by FSIC or Merger
Sub, nor the consummation by FSIC or Merger Sub of the Transactions, nor
performance of this Agreement by FSIC or Merger Sub, will (i) violate any
provision of the FSIC Charter, FSIC Bylaws or the bylaws or charter of Merger
Sub or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in

Contract or other obligation to which FSIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets is bound except, with respect to clause (ii)(B), any such
violation, conflict, breach, loss, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, consent, approval or creation that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to FSIC and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_ of the
FSIC Disclosure Schedule sets forth, to FSICs knowledge, any material consent
fees payable to a third party in connection with the Merger.

(a) FSIC has timely filed or furnished all forms, statements, certifications,
reports and documents that it was required to file since the Applicable Date
with the SEC (such filings since the Applicable Date, the " _FSIC SEC Reports_
"). No FSIC SEC Report, at the time filed or furnished with the SEC, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. As of their respective dates, all FSIC SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto. None of the Consolidated Subsidiaries of FSIC is

Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the
conduct of its business (or to FSICs knowledge that, upon consummation of the
Merger, would restrict in any material respect the conduct of the business of
FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries), or that in any material manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit,
risk management or compliance policies, its internal controls, its management
or its business, other than those of general application that apply to
similarly situated BDCs or their Consolidated Subsidiaries, nor has FSIC or

independent public accountant as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with FSIC on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

balance sheet of FSIC as of March 31, 2018 included in the unaudited financial

2017, (D) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

allow FSICs principal executive officer and principal financial officer to
make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports;

(ii) designed and maintained a system of internal controls over financial
reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance concerning the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements

(a) FSIC and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is in compliance, and has
been operated in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
Laws, including, if and to the extent applicable, the Investment Company Act,
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act other than as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to FSIC. FSIC has not received any written or, to FSICs
knowledge, oral notification from a Governmental Entity of any material non-
compliance with any applicable Laws, which non-compliance would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to FSIC and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. FSIC has operated in compliance
with all listing standards of the NYSE since FSIC Common Stock began trading
on the NYSE on April 16, 2014 other than as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to FSIC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. FSIC is not subject to any "stop order" and
is, and was, fully qualified to sell shares of FSIC Common Stock in each
jurisdiction in which such shares were registered and sold, other than as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to FSIC.

(b) FSIC is in compliance, and since it commenced operations, has complied
with its investment policies and restrictions and portfolio valuation methods,
if any, as such policies and restrictions have been set forth in its
registration statement (as amended from time to time) or reports that it
has filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act and applicable Laws, if any,
other than any non-compliance that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to FSIC.

(c) FSIC has written policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Rule
38a-1 under the Investment Company Act that are reasonably designed to
prevent material violations of the "Federal Securities Laws," as such term is
defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under the Investment Company Act. There have been
no "Material Compliance Matters" for FSIC, as such term is defined in Rule
38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment Company Act, other than those that have been
reported to FSICs Board of Directors and satisfactorily remedied or are in
the process of being remedied or those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to FSIC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(d) FSIC and each of its Consolidated Subsidiaries holds and is in compliance
with all Permits required in order to permit FSIC and each of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries to own or lease their properties and assets and
to conduct their businesses under and pursuant to all applicable Law as
presently conducted, other than any failure to hold or non-compliance with
any such Permit that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. All such Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. FSIC has
not received any written or, to FSICs knowledge, oral notification from a
Governmental Entity of any material non-compliance with any such Permits, and
no Proceeding is pending or threatened in writing to suspend, cancel, modify,
revoke or materially limit any such Permits, which Proceeding would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

FSIC has been subject to disqualification to serve in any capacity
contemplated by the Investment Company Act for any investment company
(including a BDC) under Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment Company Act,
unless, in each case, such Person has received exemptive relief from the SEC
with respect to any such disqualification. There is no material Proceeding
pending and served or, to the knowledge of FSIC, threatened that would result
in any such disqualification.

 

(f) The minute books and other similar records of FSIC contain a true and
complete record in all material respects of all action taken at all meetings
and by all written consents in lieu of meetings of the stockholders of FSIC,
the Board of Directors of FSIC and any committees of the Board of Directors of
FSIC.

 

4.10 _FSIC Information_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
FSIC for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration

CCT Stockholders Meeting or the FSIC Stockholders Meeting, in each case,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances

all material Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all material Taxes that have been incurred or
are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local
taxing authorities other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or are being
contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have been
adequately reserved against under GAAP. No material Tax Return of FSIC or any
Consolidated Subsidiary has been examined by the IRS or other relevant taxing
authority. There are no material disputes pending, or written claims
asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon FSIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries for which FSIC does not have reserves that are adequate under
GAAP. Neither FSIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is a party to or
is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an

Consolidated Subsidiaries). Within the past five years (or otherwise as part
of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part), neither FSIC nor any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock which qualified or was
intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code and to which Section 355
of the Code (or so much of Section 356 of the Code, as it relates to Section
355 of the Code) applied or was intended to apply. Neither FSIC nor any of
its Consolidated Subsidiaries is required to include in income any adjustment
pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code, no such adjustment has been proposed

method has been submitted by FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries.

within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b), such entity
has properly disclosed such transaction in accordance with the applicable Tax
regulations.

 

(b) FSIC made a valid election under Part I of Subchapter M of Subtitle A,
Chapter 1, of the Code to be taxed as a RIC. FSIC has qualified as a RIC at
all times since 2009 and expects to continue to so qualify through the
Effective Time. No challenge to FSICs status as a RIC is pending or has been
threatened orally or in writing. For each taxable year of the FSIC ending on
or before the Effective Time, FSIC has satisfied the distribution
requirements imposed on a regulated investment company under Section 852 of
the Code.

the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will not have engaged in
any other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities or
obligations other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes and have, within the time and in the manner prescribed by applicable
Law, in all material respects, withheld from and paid over all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws.

expected to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

described in Section 852(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 and the amount of "net unrealized built-in
gain" (within the meaning of Section 1374(d) of the Code) on each such asset.
Other than such assets listed in Section 4.11(g) of the FSIC Disclosure
Schedule, FSIC is not now and will not be subject to corporate-level income
taxation on the sale, transfer or other disposition of its assets currently
held as a result of the application of Section 337(d) of the Code or the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(h) No claim has been made in writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns
that FSIC or any such Consolidated Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction, and which, if upheld, would reasonably result in a
material Tax liability.

 

(i) Neither the FSIC nor any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has, or has ever
had, a permanent establishment in any country other than the United States.

payable pursuant to a contractual obligation.

payable) upon any of the assets of FSIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries.

 

4.12 _Litigation_. There are no material Proceedings pending or, to FSICs
knowledge, threatened against FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries.
There is no Order binding upon FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries
other than such Orders as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to FSIC and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

has (i) any employees or (ii) any Employee Benefit Plans.

as a whole, is or could be conducted or the types of business that FSIC and
its Consolidated Subsidiaries conducts or may conduct;

33 (b) Each FSIC Material Contract is (x) valid and binding on FSIC or its
applicable Consolidated Subsidiary and, to FSICs knowledge, each other party
thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and (z) is in full force and effect other
than in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. The investment advisory agreement between FSIC and the Joint Advisor
has been approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders of FSIC in
accordance with Section 15 of the Investment Company Act. Neither FSIC nor any
of its Consolidated Subsidiaries nor, to FSICs knowledge, any other party

Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

4.15 _Insurance Coverage_. All material insurance policies maintained by FSIC

possess or have a valid license or other adequate rights to use all
Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the conduct of the business
of FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole (hereinafter, "
_FSIC Intellectual Property Rights_ "), except where the failure to own,
possess or have adequate rights would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to FSIC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No claims are pending for which FSIC has
received written notice or, to the knowledge of FSIC, threatened (i) that
FSIC or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise
violating the rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property
Right, or (ii) that any FSIC Intellectual Property Right is invalid or

Material Adverse Effect with respect to FSIC. None of FSIC nor any of

indemnification to any third party pursuant to Environmental Laws in relation
to any property previously owned by FSIC or any of its Consolidated
Subsidiaries.

notice of any pending or contemplated condemnation, expropriation or other
Proceeding in eminent domain affecting the FSIC Leased Real Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein, except for such Proceedings as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither FSIC nor
any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries has received any written notice that the

material respect any easement, covenant, condition, restriction or similar
provision in any instrument of record or other unrecorded agreement affecting
the FSIC Leased Real Property, as applicable, other than such violations as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be

Liens consisting of restrictions on transfer agreed to in respect of
investments entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of

or the other Transactions.

 



35 4.21 _Valuation_. Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties, the value
of each investment asset owned by FSIC that is used in connection with the
computations made by FSIC pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ will be determined

other obligation to which the Joint Advisor is a party or by which its
properties or assets is bound except, with respect to clause (ii)(B), any such

Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with the execution, delivery

required by applicable Law (other than the Investment Advisers Act) since
April 9, 2018 has been, duly registered, licensed or qualified as
an investment adviser in each state or any other jurisdiction where the
conduct of its business requires such registration, licensing or

qualified would not, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Joint Advisor is in compliance, and has been operated in compliance,
in all material respects, with all applicable Laws, including, if and to the
extent applicable, the Investment Advisers Act, Investment Company Act, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act other than as would not, individually or

order to permit the Joint Advisor to own or lease its properties and assets
and to conduct its business under and pursuant to all applicable Law as
presently conducted, other than any failure to hold or non-compliance with any
such Permit that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Joint Advisor. All such Permits are valid and
in full force and effect, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Joint Advisor. The
Joint Advisor has not received any written or, to the Joint Advisors
knowledge, oral notification from a Governmental Entity of any material non-
compliance with any such Permits, and no Proceeding is pending or threatened

required by Rule 206(4)-7 under the Investment Advisers Act (complete and
correct copies of which have been made available to CCT and FSIC) and, during
the period prior to the date of this Agreement that the Joint Advisor has
been the investment adviser to FSIC or CCT, the Joint Advisor has been in
compliance with such policies and procedures, except where the failures to
adopt such policies and procedures or to be in compliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to FSIC and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or CCT and its Consolidated Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

5.4 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Joint Advisors
knowledge, threatened against the Joint Advisor. There is no Order binding
upon the Joint Advisor other than such Orders as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Joint Advisor.

 

5.5 _Valuation_. Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties, the value of
each investment asset owned by CCT that is used in connection with the
computations made by the Joint Advisor on behalf of CCT pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.6_ will be determined in accordance with the valuation policies and
procedures approved by the Board of Directors of CCT as of June 30, 2018 and
set forth in CCTs compliance policies and procedures and no exceptions to
such valuation policies and procedures have been or will be permitted in
valuing such assets in connection with the computations pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_ for purposes of this Agreement, and the value of all
assets owned by CCT other than investment assets that are used in connection
with the computations made by the Joint Advisor on behalf of CCT pursuant
to Section 2.6 will be determined in accordance with GAAP. Except as may be
mutually agreed by the parties, all valuations made by third-party valuation
agents for such purposes will be made only by valuation agents that have been
approved by the Board of Directors of CCT as of June 30, 2018. Except as may
be mutually agreed by the parties, the value of each investment asset owned by
FSIC that is used in connection with the computations made by the Joint
Advisor on behalf of FSIC pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ will be determined
in accordance with the valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board
of Directors of FSIC as of June 30, 2018 and set forth in FSICs compliance
policies and procedures and no exceptions to such valuation policies and
procedures have been or will be permitted in valuing such assets in connection
with the computations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ for purposes of this
Agreement, and the value of all assets owned by FSIC other than investment
assets that are used in connection with the computations made by the Joint
Advisor on behalf of FSIC pursuant to Section 2.6 will be determined in
accordance with GAAP. Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties, all
valuations made

 



38  by third-party valuation agents for such purposes will be made only by
valuation agents that have been approved by the Board of Directors of FSIC as
of June 30, 2018. The Closing CCT Net Asset Value presented by the Joint
Advisor to the Board of Directors of CCT will reflect the Joint Advisors
assessment of the fair value of any portfolio securities of CCT for which
market quotations are not readily available. The Closing FSIC Net Asset Value
presented by the Joint Advisor to the Board of Directors of FSIC will reflect
the Joint Advisors assessment of the fair value of any portfolio securities
of FSIC for which market quotations are not readily available. No systematic
differences exist with respect to the underlying methodologies and conventions
used by CCT, FSIC and the third-party valuation agents to value the assets of
CCT and FSIC, respectively.

available to it necessary for the performance of its services and obligations
as contemplated in the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and under this Agreement.

Adverse Recommendation Change as expressly permitted pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.8_, the parties shall cooperate with each other and use reasonable best

advisable, to consummate the Transactions (including the Merger) in the most
expeditious manner practicable, and to comply with the terms and conditions of
all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities.

In furtherance (but not in limitation) of the foregoing, each of FSIC and CCT
shall as promptly as practicable file any required applications, notices or
other filings under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Law, CCT and FSIC shall
have the right to review in advance, and, to the

 



45  extent practicable, each shall consult the other on all the information
relating to CCT or FSIC, as the case may be, and any of their respective

materials submitted to, any third-party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties
shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Permits of all
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions

CCT, on the other hand, shall each, in connection with the efforts referenced
in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ to obtain all requisite Permits for the

other party to review, in advance, any written communication given by it to or
received from, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Entity, and to
the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, or other applicable Governmental
Entity, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences subject to applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require either FSIC and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or CCT
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries to make payments or provide other
consideration for the repayment, restructuring or amendment of terms

set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ of the CCT Disclosure Schedule and
_Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_ of the FSIC Disclosure Schedule.

 

7.2 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) FSIC and CCT shall as promptly as practicable, but in no case later than

to consummate the Mergers. CCT and FSIC shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be promptly mailed or delivered

requested by FSIC in connection with any such action.

approval may be materially delayed or conditioned.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 7.7_, CCT shall
submit to its stockholders the CCT Matters on the terms and conditions set

7.5 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, FSIC shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law and as set forth in the Indemnification Agreement, dated
July 22, 2018, by and between CCT and each member of CCTs Board of Directors,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless and advance expenses to the present and
former directors and officers of CCT or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries

and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs or expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred,
reasonable experts fees, reasonable travel expenses, court costs, transcript
fees and telecommunications, postage and courier charges), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement or other
liabilities (collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") incurred in
connection with any Proceeding arising out of actions or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions). In the event
of any such Indemnified Liabilities, (i) FSIC shall advance to such
Indemnified Party, upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably and actually incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced,
or someone on his or her behalf, provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification and complies with other applicable provisions imposed under
the Investment Company Act and interpretations thereof by the SEC or its staff
and (ii) FSIC and the applicable Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the
defense of such matter.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, CCT shall, and, if CCT is unable to, FSIC

CCTs existing directors and officers insurance policies for a claims
reporting or discovery period of six years from and after the Effective Time

conditions that are not materially less advantageous to the insureds as,
CCTs existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Current D andO Insurance_"). If CCT and the
Surviving Company or its successor for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or its
successor shall, and FSIC shall cause the Surviving Company or its successor
to, continue to maintain in effect for the Tail Period the Current DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with coverage and amounts
not less than, and terms and conditions that are not materially less
advantageous to the insureds as, provided in the Current DandO Insurance, or the
Surviving Company or its successor shall, and FSIC shall cause the Surviving
Company or its successor to, purchase comparable insurance for the Tail
Period; _provided_ , that in no event shall the annual cost of such insurance
exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium
paid by CCT for such purpose; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Company or its
successor shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

 



49 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  _Section_
__ _ 7.5(a)_, upon learning of any Proceeding described above, shall promptly
notify FSIC in writing; _provided_ , that the failure to so notify shall not
affect the obligations of FSIC under  _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_ unless FSIC is
materially prejudiced as a consequence.

(d) If FSIC or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
any other entity, then and in each such case, FSIC shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of FSIC shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

7.6 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Each of CCT and FSIC shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates,
Consolidated Subsidiaries, and its and each of their respective officers,
directors, trustees, managers, employees, consultants, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors, representatives and agents
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be
ongoing with respect to, or that are intended to or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, and demand the immediate return or
destruction (which destruction shall be certified in writing to CCT or FSIC,
as applicable) of all confidential information previously furnished to any
Person (other than CCT, FSIC or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives) with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Prior to the Effective
Time, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ in the case of CCT and  _Section_ __ _
7.8_ in the case of FSIC, each of CCT and FSIC shall not, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates, Consolidated Subsidiaries and its and their respective

encourage or take any other action (including by providing information)

inquiries or the making or submission or implementation of any proposal or
offer (including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to
any Takeover Proposal; (ii) approve, publicly endorse or recommend or enter
into any agreement, arrangement, discussions or understandings with respect to

in principle, memorandum of understanding or confidentiality agreement)
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate, or that is intended
to or that could reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment of,
termination of or failure to consummate, the Merger or any other Transaction;
(iii) initiate or participate in any way in any negotiations or discussions
regarding, or furnish or

proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal; (iv) publicly propose or publicly announce an intention to
take any of the foregoing actions; or (v) grant any (x) approval pursuant to

Affiliates) or with respect to any transaction (other than the Transactions)
or (y) waiver or release under any standstill or any similar agreement with
respect to equity securities of CCT or FSIC.

other party in writing of any request for information or any Takeover Proposal
and the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry
(including the identity of the Person (or group of Persons) making such

copies of any written materials received by CCT or FSIC or their respective
Representatives in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of

(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and keep the other party informed on a reasonably current
basis of any information requested of or provided by CCT or FSIC and as to the

7.7 _CCT Takeover Proposals_.

 

(a) If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the CCT
Stockholders Meeting: (i) CCT receives a bona fide unsolicited Takeover
Proposal (under circumstances in which CCT has complied in all material
respects with the provisions of _Sections_ _7.6(a)_ and _(b)_ ); (ii) the
Board of Directors of CCT shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that (x) failure to
consider such Takeover Proposal would be reasonably likely to be a breach of
the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of CCT under applicable
Law and (y) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a CCT Superior Proposal; and (iii) CCT gives FSIC at least two (2)
Business Days prior written notice of the identity of the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and
CCTs intention to furnish information to, or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, the Person making such Takeover Proposal then, subject to
compliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7(a)_, CCT may:

(i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Person who has made the
unsolicited bona fide Takeover Proposal and provide information in response to
a request therefor by a Person who has made such Takeover Proposal if CCT (A)
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement with
customary terms (including a standstill) and (B) provides FSIC a copy of all
such information that has not previously been delivered to FSIC simultaneously
with delivery to such Person (or such Persons Representatives and
Affiliates); and

 



51 (ii) after fulfilling its obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 7.7(b)_ below,
adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend such Takeover Proposal, including entering into an agreement with
respect thereto (collectively, a " _Takeover Approval_ ").

If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the CCT
Stockholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of CCT shall have determined, by
a majority of its members, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that continued recommendation of the CCT Matters to CCTs stockholders would
be reasonably likely to be a breach of the standard of conduct applicable to
the directors of CCT under applicable Law as a result of a CCT Superior
Proposal, CCT may (A) withdraw or qualify (or modify or amend in a manner
adverse to FSIC), or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or modify or
amend in a manner adverse to FSIC), the approval, adoption, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of CCT of the CCT
Matters, including the recommendation of the Board of Directors of CCT that
the stockholders of CCT approve the Merger (the " _CCT Recommendation_ ") and
(B) take any action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection
with the CCT Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the
CCT Recommendation (any action described in clause (A) and (B) referred to
collectively with any Takeover Approval as an " _CCT Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

 

(b) Upon any determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a CCT Superior
Proposal, CCT shall promptly provide (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours of such determination) to FSIC a written notice (a " _Notice of a
CCT Superior Proposal_ ") (i) advising FSIC that the Board of Directors of CCT
has received a CCT Superior Proposal, (ii) specifying in reasonable detail
the material terms and conditions of such CCT Superior Proposal, including the
amount per share or other consideration that the stockholders of CCT will
receive in connection with the Superior Proposal and including a copy of
all written materials provided to or by CCT in connection with such CCT
Superior Proposal (unless previously provided to FSIC) and (iii) identifying
the Person making such CCT Superior Proposal. CCT shall cooperate and
negotiate in good faith with FSIC (to the extent FSIC desires to negotiate)
during the five (5) calendar day period following FSICs receipt of the Notice
of a CCT Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such CCT Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new two (2) calendar day period) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable CCT
to determine that such CCT Superior Proposal is no longer a CCT Superior
Proposal and proceed with a CCT Recommendation without a CCT Adverse
Recommendation Change. If thereafter the Board of Directors of CCT determines,
in its reasonable good faith judgment, by a majority of its members,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and after giving effect to
any proposed adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that such CCT Superior
Proposal remains a CCT Superior Proposal or the failure to make such CCT
Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be a breach of
the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of CCT under applicable
Law, and CCT has complied in all material respects with _Section_ __ _
7.7(a)_ above, CCT may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)(iv)_.

 



52 (c) Other than as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.7(a)_, neither CCT nor
the Board of Directors of CCT shall make any CCT Adverse Recommendation
Change. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no CCT Adverse
Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the CCT Matters or any
other approval of the Board of Directors of CCT, including in any respect
that would have the effect of causing any Takeover Statute or other similar
statute to be applicable to the Transactions.

 

(d) CCT shall provide FSIC with prompt written notice of any meeting of CCTs
Board of Directors at which CCTs Board of Directors is reasonably expected
to consider any Takeover Proposal (such written notice shall in any event be
received by FSIC reasonably in advance of such meeting).

 

(e) Other than in connection with a CCT Takeover Proposal, nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit or restrict CCTs Board of Directors from taking any
action described in clause (A) of the definition of CCT Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event (a " _CCT Intervening Event
Recommendation Change_ ") if (A) prior to effecting any such CCT Intervening
Event Recommendation Change, CCT promptly notifies FSIC, in writing, at least
five (5) Business Days (the " _CCT Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") before
taking such action of its intent to consider such action (which notice shall
not, by itself, constitute a CCT Adverse Recommendation Change or a CCT
Intervening Event Recommendation Change), and which notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and
the reasons for taking, such action, (B) CCT shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the CCT Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate
with FSIC in good faith (to the extent FSIC desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement that would not
permit CCTs Board of Directors to make a CCT Intervening Event Recommendation
Change, and (C) CCTs Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) determines,
after consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
the failure to effect such a CCT Intervening Event Recommendation Change, as
applicable, after taking into account any adjustments made by FSIC during the
CCT Intervening Event Notice Period, would be reasonably likely to be a
breach of the standard of conduct applicable to the directors of CCT under
applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit CCT from
(i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to any Takeover Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure
to CCTs stockholders if, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
CCT determines that such disclosure would be required under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosures (other than a "stop, look
and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a CCT
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of CCT expressly
publicly reaffirms the CCT Recommendation (i) in such communication or (ii)
within three (3) Business Days after being requested in writing to do so by
FSIC.

effect a Takeover Approval. 

If on or after the date of this Agreement and at any time prior to the FSIC

_Notice of a FSIC Superior Proposal_ ") (i) advising CCT that the Board of
Directors of FSIC has received a FSIC Superior Proposal, (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such FSIC Superior
Proposal, including the amount per share that the stockholders of FSIC will
receive and including a copy of all written materials provided to or by FSIC
in connection with such FSIC Superior Proposal (unless previously provided to
CCT) and (iii) identifying the Person making such FSIC Superior Proposal. FSIC
shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith with CCT (to the extent CCT
desires to negotiate) during the five (5) calendar day period following CCTs
receipt of the Notice of a FSIC Superior Proposal (it being understood that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such FSIC
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new two (2) calendar day
period) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would enable FSIC to determine that such FSIC Superior Proposal is no
longer a FSIC Superior Proposal and proceed with a FSIC Recommendation
without a FSIC Adverse Recommendation Change. If thereafter the Board of

majority of its members, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and after giving effect to any proposed adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that such FSIC Superior Proposal remains a FSIC Superior Proposal or
the failure to make such FSIC Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to be a breach of the standard of conduct applicable to the
directors of FSIC under applicable Law, and FSIC has complied in all material
respects with _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_ above, FSIC may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(iv)_.

(c) Other than as permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a)_, neither FSIC nor the
Board of Directors of FSIC shall make any FSIC Adverse Recommendation Change.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no FSIC Adverse

to consider any Takeover Proposal (such written notice shall in any event be

monetary damages under this Agreement.

 



68 (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions, that without these
agreements each party would not have entered into this Agreement, and that any
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ do not constitute a
penalty. If FSIC fails to pay any amounts due to CCT pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ within the time periods specified in this _Section_ __ _
9.2_ or CCT fails to pay FSIC any amounts due to FSIC pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ within the time periods specified in this _Section_ __ _

in each case, any applicable definitions) shall survive any termination of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from any liabilities for damages incurred or suffered by another party
arising out of the willful or intentional breach by such party of any
provision of this Agreement or a failure or refusal by such party to
consummate this Agreement and the Transactions when such party was obligated
to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.

obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other non-compliance.

this Agreement. Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include the plural, and any plural term the singular. If any term, provision,
covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a
federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants
and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any
reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any term, provision,
covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the express
intention of the parties that such term, provision, covenant or restriction be
enforced to the maximum extent permitted. The parties have jointly
participated in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an
ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties (including by facsimile or other electronic means), it being
understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart.

11.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

11.6 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall
be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Maryland applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such
state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles that would
cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction, except to the
extent governed by the Investment Company Act, in which case the latter shall
control. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding brought by any party to
enforce any

 



78  provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the Circuit Court for
Baltimore City, Maryland, or if jurisdiction over the matter is vested
exclusively in federal courts, the United States District Court for the
District of Maryland, and the appellate courts to which orders and judgments
therefore may be appealed (collectively, the " _Acceptable Courts_ "). In any
such judicial proceeding, each of the parties further consents to the
assignment of any proceeding in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland
to the Business and Technology Case Management Program pursuant to Maryland
Rule 16-205 (or any successor thereof). Each of the parties hereto submits to
the jurisdiction of any Acceptable Court in any Proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection
with, this Agreement or the Transactions and hereby irrevocably waives the
benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise
in such Proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any Proceeding in any such Acceptable Court or that
any such Proceeding brought in any such Acceptable Court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of any action, suit or
proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) certifies that it makes
this waiver voluntarily and (c) acknowledges that it and the other parties
hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things,
the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section_ __ _ 11.6_.

 

11.7 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section_
__ _ 7.5_, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred
to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

 

11.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located in the State of Maryland,
without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives

 



79  any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party
is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party hereto has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity.

11.9 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, FSIC, CCT
and the Joint Advisor each delivered to the other party a schedule (the "
_FSIC Disclosure Schedule_ ", the " _CCT Disclosure Schedule_ " and the "
_Joint Advisor Disclosure Schedule_ ", respectively, each, a " _Disclosure
Schedule_ ") that sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ , as
applicable, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Disclosure
Schedule shall be numbered to correspond with the sections and subsections
contained in this Agreement. The disclosure in any section or subsection of
each Disclosure Schedule, shall qualify only (i) the corresponding section or
subsection, as the case may be, of this Agreement, (ii) other sections or
subsections of this Agreement to the extent specifically cross-referenced in
such section or subsection thereof, and (iii) other sections or subsections
of this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections or
subsections.
