AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of May 12, 2006, is
by and among Brookdale Senior Living Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Beta Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and American Retirement
Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (the "Company").   W I T N E S S E T
H:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company
and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and   WHEREAS, concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement, Parent is entering into (A) an
employment agreement in the form attached as Exhibit A-1 hereto with the
individual set forth on such Exhibit A-1 and (B) employment agreements in the
form attached as Exhibit A-2 hereto with the individuals set forth on such
Exhibit A-2 (such employment agreements referred to in clauses (A) and (B),
collectively, the "New Employment Agreements," and such individuals set forth
on Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 hereto, the "Covered Employees") in order to
provide for the continued service and employment of such persons.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I.  The Merger   Section 1.01. The Merger. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the "TBCA") and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the TBCA and the
DGCL.   Section 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified
by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, NY 10036, unless another date or place
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   Section 1.03. Effective
Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on
the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Tennessee (the "Tennessee Secretary of State") and a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of State"), each
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the TBCA and the DGCL,
respectively, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the TBCA and the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger and
Certificate of Merger are duly filed with the Tennessee Secretary of
State and the Delaware Secretary of State, respectively, or at such other
time as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Articles
of Merger and the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time").   Section 1.04. Effects of the
Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of the TBCA and the DGCL.   Section 1.05.
Charter; Bylaws.   (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as modified to the extent
required by the TBCA, shall be the Charter of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by the TBCA or other
applicable Law (as defined herein).   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as modified to the extent
required by the TBCA, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law;
provided, however, that the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation set forth in Section 6.04 hereof.   Section 1.06. Directors. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly designated, as the
case may be.   Section 1.07. Officers. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.   ARTICLE II.  Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the
Constituent Entities;  Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options  
Section 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") or of any shares of common stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Common Stock
of Merger Sub. The issued and outstanding common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Merger Sub shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each issued
and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than as provided in
Section 2.02(j) with respect to shares as to which appraisal rights have been
perfected), together with the rights (the "Company Rights") issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement, dated as of November 18, 1998, between the Company
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent (the "Company
Rights Plan"), shall be converted into the right to receive $33.00 in cash
(the "Merger Consideration") without interest.   Section 2.02. Surrender and
Payment.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as the paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled thereto (the "Paying
Agent"). Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in an amount sufficient to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2.01(b) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.02 (such funds, the "Payment Fund").
In the event the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to make all such
payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional
funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of funds required to make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in their sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock entitled thereto.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall
accrue to the benefit of the holders of the shares of Company Common
Stock.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of an outstanding share of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Certificates")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Paying
Agent and which shall be in the form and shall have such other provisions as
the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the payment of the Merger Consideration to be made to the holder
thereof pursuant to Section 2.01. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and
such Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying
Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock or on the consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock.  
(c) No Further Ownership Rights; Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books.
All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. If Certificates are
presented to the Company for transfer following the Effective Time, they
shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.   (d)
Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund and any interest
received with respect thereto that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates who
have not complied with this Section 2.02 prior to the end of such six (6)
month period shall thereafter look, only as general creditors thereof, to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to Section 2.02 (e)) for payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates.   (e) No Liability. None of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, any of their respective
Affiliates or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash held in the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
the requirements of any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to
three (3) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any cash in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such cash in
respect of such shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f)
Transfer Taxes. If payment is to be made in respect of any Certificate to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
applicable consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.   (g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of a Certificate or Company Stock Option (as defined herein) such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
(including, without limitation, under Section 1445 of the Code), Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code or any provisions of applicable state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Company
Stock Option, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent.   (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement.   (i) Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.
If prior to the Effective Time, (i) solely as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock
distribution which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all
holders of Company Common Stock there is a change in the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of securities or rights convertible or exchangeable or exercisable
for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii) the Company makes a cash dividend
on a pro rata basis to all holders of Company Common Stock, then the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of the
applicable shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   (j) Dissenting Shares.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a shareholder who has properly exercised such
shareholder\'s appraisal rights available under the TBCA (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such shareholder shall
have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
shareholder\'s right to appraisal under the TBCA. Dissenting Shares shall be
treated in accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBCA. If any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right to appraisal, such shareholder\'s shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificates held
by such shareholder without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any notices or demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the TBCA and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares,
as provided in the TBCA, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or
notices. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any notices or demands for
appraisals, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such notices or demands.   Section 2.03. Company Stock Options.  
(a) All stock options (the "Company Stock Options") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time granted under the Company\'s 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan, 1997 Stock Incentive Plan or Associate Stock Purchase Plan, whether
vested or unvested (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and be converted into and become the right to receive a
lump sum payment in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which such Company Stock Option shall not have been previously exercised.
Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall amend the
Company\'s Associate Stock Purchase Plan to provide that (i) the "Option
Period" (as defined in the plan) which includes the date of this Agreement
shall terminate at the earlier of June 30, 2006 or the Effective Time, and
(ii) no Option Period shall commence during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing Date or the date on which this
Agreement is terminated. Any payments to be made pursuant to this Section
2.03(a) shall be reduced by any tax withholding required by Law.   (b)
Except as may be otherwise provided in this Section 2.03, the Company shall
cause all rights, stock options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to be cancelled
prior to the Effective Time without any payment being made therefor.   (c)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause all employee-holders of outstanding options under its 2006
Stock Incentive Plan, 1997 Stock Incentive Plan or Associate Stock Purchase
Plan who are not Covered Employees to enter into an optionee agreement in one
of the forms set forth on Exhibit C hereto (the "New Optionee Agreements"),
and shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions that are necessary or
appropriate to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Sections 2.03
(a) and (b) and to give effect to relevant provisions of the New Employment
Agreements and the New Optionee Agreements. The form of New
Optionee Agreement to be offered to each such optionee shall be determined by
Parent.   ARTICLE III.  Representations and Warranties of the Company  
Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (with specific reference to the
Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which the information stated in
such disclosure relates; provided that any fact or condition disclosed in
any section of such disclosure letter in such a way as to make its relevance
to a representation or representations made elsewhere in this Agreement
or information called for by another section of such disclosure letter
reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such representation
or representations or to be disclosed on such other section of such
disclosure letter notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   Section 3.01.
Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is formed and has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in, and would not
reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined herein). The Company has, prior to the date hereof, made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of its Charter (the "Company Charter") and
Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws") and the charter and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement. The Company has made available to
Parent and its representatives correct and complete copies of the minutes of
all meetings of shareholders, the board of directors of the Company (the
"Company Board") and each committee of the Company Board and the board of
directors of each of its Subsidiaries held since December 31, 2001.  
Section 3.02. Subsidiaries. Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists all the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, the
state of formation and each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary
is qualified or licensed to do business. Except for Permitted Liens and as
set forth on Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter, all the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), and free of any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other equity interests. Except for the capital stock or other equity
or voting interests of its Subsidiaries and those equity interests described
on Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not own,

violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time

Subsidiaries, (ii) except as set forth on Section 3.04(b) of the Company

the underlying causes thereof); (v) changes in Laws, rules or regulations;

of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of
footnote disclosure and to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments

the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically

to the Knowledge of the Company, any third party service provider acting on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received, nor otherwise

Subsidiaries or any such third party service provider is under investigation
or the subject of an inquiry by any such Governmental Authority for such
alleged material noncompliance) with any applicable material Law, or (y)
would be reasonably likely to result in a material fine, assessment or cease
and desist order, or the suspension, revocation or material limitation or

of its Subsidiaries.   (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented
policies, procedures and/or programs designed to assure that its agents and

laws, regulations, directives and opinions of Governmental Authorities

Section 3.12. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Section 3.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of: all "employee
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income

including bonus plans, employment, consulting or other compensation
agreements, collective bargaining agreements, Company Stock Plans, individual
stock option agreements to which the Company is a party granting stock
options to acquire Company Common Stock that have not been granted under a

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries contributed or is obligated to contribute thereunder for current

(iv) summary plan descriptions; and (v) material written communications to

material respects in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of
ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, and neither the Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries) nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with
respect to the Company Plans has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA that would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
liability for any material amount. No fiduciary has any liability for breach
of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply with applicable Law
in connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any
Company Plan.   (d) The Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401
of the Code are so qualified and any trusts intended to be exempt from
Federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code are so exempt.   (e)
None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any trade or business (whether or
not incorporated) that is treated as a single employer, with any of them
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (or would have been
so treated at any time during the six years immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement) has any current or contingent liability with respect to (i) a
plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of
the Code or (ii) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA).   (f) All contributions (including all employer contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under
any of the Company Plans (including workers compensation) or by Law (without
regard to any waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code), to any funds or
trusts established thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by
the due date thereof (including any valid extension), except where failure to
do so has not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (g) There
are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits that have been asserted or
instituted against the Company Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under
the Company Plans or the sponsor or administrator of any of the Company
Plans, or against any fiduciary of the Company Plans with respect to
the operation of any of the Company Plans (other than routine benefit
claims), nor does the Company have any Knowledge of facts that could form the
basis for any such action, claim or lawsuit, other than such actions, claims
or lawsuits that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (h)
None of the Company Plans provides for post-employment life or health
insurance, benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), or applicable state
law, or which is provided at the expense of the participant or the
participant\'s beneficiary. Each of the Company and any ERISA Affiliate which
maintains a "group health plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code has complied with the notice and continuation requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and the regulations thereunder, except where the failure to comply
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (i) Except as set
forth on Section 3.12(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (to the extent
applicable, in each case broken down as to each item, and the individual and
amount involved), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Company Shareholder Approval or the Merger (either by themselves or when
combined with any other event), will (i) result in any payment becoming due

Statutes; Company Rights Plan. Assuming that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
an "interested shareholder" within the meaning of the TBCA, the Company has
taken all necessary action so that no "investor protection act," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation, in each case under the TBCA, nor any takeover provision in the
Company Charter or the Company Bylaws would (i) prohibit or restrict the
Company\'s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the
Articles of Merger or the Certificate of Merger or its ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) have the effect of
invalidating or voiding this Agreement, the Articles of Merger or
the Certificate of Merger, or any provision hereof or thereof, or (iii)
subject Parent to any impediment or condition in connection with the exercise
of any of its rights under this Agreement, the Articles of Merger or the
Certificate of Merger. The Company has taken all actions necessary to render
the Company Rights inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and to cause the Company Rights Plan to terminate as of
the Effective Time.   ARTICLE IV.  Representations and Warranties of Parent

Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so

and would not reasonably be expected to result in, material direct or
indirect costs or liabilities to Parent and its Subsidiaries. Parent has,
prior to the date hereof, made available to the Company complete and correct
copies of its Articles of Incorporation (the "Parent Articles") and Bylaws

warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights, convertible securities or other
agreements or commitments obligating Merger Sub to issue, transfer or
sell any Merger Sub Interests to any person, other than Parent.   Section
4.03. Authority; Noncontravention.   (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has

proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other party
hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, solvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors\' rights
generally from time to time in effect and by general principles of equity).

Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss
of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of
the properties or other assets of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or Merger
Sub under (i) the Parent Articles or Parent By-laws or the comparable
organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, (ii) any

Sub or their respective properties or other assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate (A)
would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and (B) would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 4.04. Governmental Approvals. No consent, approval,
order or authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required by or with
respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for (a) Necessary Consents and (b)
such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,

its obligations under this Agreement or (y) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
Section 4.05. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be

prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any
Governmental Authority involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 4.07. No Business

hereby.   Section 4.08. Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment

financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement
of expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub.   Section 4.09. Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company a true

Parent and RIC Coinvestment Fund LP ("RIC") pursuant to which RIC has

untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any representation or warranty that is
not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or
(ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of Merger Sub) to comply
with or satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition or agreement to

that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,

Solicitation by the Company.   (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective
directors, officers, employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative retained by
the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Representatives") to, directly
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly
encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any person any information in connection
with or in furtherance of any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and instruct its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (and in no
event after obtaining such Company Shareholder Approval), in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date
hereof that the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, which may
be Cohen and Steers Capital Advisors, LLC, and of its outside counsel)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, the
Company may, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving
advice of its outside counsel) that it is necessary to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law, and subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c) and after
giving Parent two business days written notice of such determination, (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than
the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such oral or written
information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made
available to such person, as the case may be, and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.   For purposes
of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or
offer, whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn, (a) for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business
combination involving the Company, (b) for the issuance of 20% or more of the
equity securities of the Company as consideration for the assets
or securities of another person or (c) to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company or
assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) that
represent 20% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   For purposes of
this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written offer
made by a third party, that if consummated would result in such person (or
its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, 75% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger
or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all
or substantially all of the total consolidated assets of the Company (i)
on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and of its
outside counsel and in light of all relevant circumstances, including,
without limitation, all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement) to be more favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) which is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account any
financing and approval requirements and all other financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, and (iii) which does not have
a financing contingency.   (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Company Board or any
such committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger (it being understood
that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to a Takeover
Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification) or (B) recommend, adopt
or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement constituting or related to, any Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section
5.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice of its outside
counsel) that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement solely in
order to concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, but, in each case, only at a time that is after the fifth business
day following Parent\'s receipt of written notice from the Company (an
"Adverse Notice") advising Parent that the Company Board has determined that
a Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal, that the Company Board intends to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement and containing all information required by Section 5.02(c),
together with copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of such
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Adverse Notice and a new five business day period). In
determining whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Notice or otherwise)
in determining whether such third party Takeover Proposal still constitutes
a Superior Proposal.   (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company
set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information
or other inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could lead to any
Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
person making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall promptly keep Parent fully informed of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any such request, Takeover

Company\'s obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would
constitute a violation of applicable Law; provided, however, that any such
disclosure relating to a Takeover Proposal shall be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board reaffirms its recommendation
and declaration of advisability of this Agreement and the Merger.   ARTICLE
VI.  Additional Agreements   Section 6.01. Preparation of the Proxy
Statement; Shareholder Meetings.   (a) As soon as practicable following the

hereof), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement.
The Company will respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the

Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other
with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.   (b) The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a record
date for and promptly take any and all actions in connection therewith, and
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold, a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company
Shareholders Meeting") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Company shall, through
the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders adoption of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
Section 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company
shall afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries\'
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by such
party during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state
securities Laws and (b) consistent with its legal obligations all other
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries\' business,
properties and personnel as Parent or any of its Representatives may
reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company requires the Company to
restrict access to any properties or information. Except for disclosures
expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated as
of April 25, 2006, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from
time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent shall hold, and shall
cause its Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 or information
provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement
will affect any of the representations or warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of the
parties hereto.   Section 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the
taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (b) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (c) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
and (d) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting
the first sentence of this Section 6.03, each of the Company and the Company
Board and Parent and the Parent Board shall (i) take no action to cause any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation to become applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing shall
be deemed to require Parent to (A) agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold

Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of
business, (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on
business in any part of the world or (D) agree to any terms or conditions
that would impose any obligations on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or,
assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to maintain facilities, operations, places of business,
employment levels, products or businesses.   Section 6.04. Indemnification,
Exculpation and Insurance.   (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
as provided in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws (in each case, as in
effect on the date hereof) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in
the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for six years after the Effective Time.   (b) For six
years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the
Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby), covering the Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Company\'s
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with
respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that Parent may
substitute therefor a tail policy or policies of Parent containing terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such Indemnified Parties;
provided, further, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this
Section 6.04(b) Parent shall not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in
excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year
(which premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be
approximately $465,000), it being understood and agreed that Parent shall
nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for
such 250% amount.   (c) The covenants contained in this Section 6.04 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives, and
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified
Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.  
Section 6.05 Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,

Parent shall bear and pay one-half of (a) the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with filing, printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and (b) the
filing fees for the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR
Act.   Section 6.06 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties.   Section 6.07 Shareholder Litigation. The Company
shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such shareholder
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such shareholder
litigation, shall give due consideration to Parent\'s advice with respect to
such shareholder litigation and shall not settle any such litigation prior to
such consultation and consideration; provided, however, that the Company
further will not, without Parent\'s prior written consent, settle
any shareholder litigation (a) for an amount greater than $2,000,000
individually, and $3,000,000 in the aggregate or (b) that involves or has the
effect of imposing any remedy or restriction upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than monetary damages.   Section 6.08 Employee
Matters.   (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be provided to individuals who are employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who are employed
thereafter by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of Parent\'s
Subsidiaries (the "Affected Employees"), compensation and employee benefits
no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to other similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.   (b) For purposes of
eligibility and vesting, with respect to any benefit plan, program or
arrangement (including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize the service of the Affected Employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to the same extent as such service
was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plan for
those purposes; provided, however, that such recognition shall not result in
a duplication of benefits. Parent agrees to honor, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, all vacation accrued by Affected Employees as
of the Effective Time.   (c) With respect to any welfare plan in which
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions were
satisfied under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each such employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in
satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements.   (d)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend (or cause duly
authorized persons to amend) its Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the

be established by the Company and no corporate owned life insurance shall
be purchased to create a reserve for payments under the plan in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein, and (ii) if a "rabbi trust" or
a corporate-owned-life-insurance reserve has previously been established by
the Company, no contributions shall be made to any such trust and no
additional insurance coverage shall be purchased by the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein.   (e) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall amend (or cause duly authorized persons to amend) its
Deferred Compensation Plan to ensure that (i) after the date hereof no "rabbi
trust" shall be established by the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, and (ii) if a "rabbi trust" has previously
been established by the Company, no contributions shall be made to such trust
by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.  
(f) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any Affected Employee any right to continued employment for any period by
reason of this Agreement.   Section 6.09 Employment Agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Covered Employees not to
repudiate or otherwise breach the New Employment Agreement to which such
Covered Employee is a party.   Section 6.10 Standstill Agreements,
Confidentiality Agreements, Anti-takeover Provisions. During the period from

its terms or by written agreement of the parties thereto. During such period,
the Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable

cause its Subsidiaries to form, on or prior to the Closing, new wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, and, at the Closing execute any documents, agreements and
instruments and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Financing, all in such order, form and
substance as reasonably requested by Parent; provided that such cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business operations of the
Company, require the expenditure of any material amount of money by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, violate any contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or violate any Law.   Section 6.13
Hedging Agreements. During the period of time from the date of this Agreement
and through the Effective Time, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
enter into fixed-rate interest rate swap agreements or similar arrangements,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with respect to all
or a portion of its currently outstanding floating-rate indebtedness;

thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or any other applicable

The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are further
subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the
following conditions:   (a) Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
(other than the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 3.03) shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (without regard to
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers contained therein),
except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date, except where the
failure of the representations and warranties to be true and correct
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.03 shall be true and correct
in all respects (subject to de minimis exceptions for breaches involving
discrepancies of no more than 30,000 shares of Company Common Stock or stock
options in the aggregate covering no more than 30,000 shares of Company
Common Stock) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as

Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock, seeking to restrain or prohibit
the consummation of the Merger, seeking to place limitations on the ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation) by Parent or Merger Sub, or (ii) seeking to (A)

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to maintain facilities, operations, places of business, employment levels,

custom and practice (if any) to allow a reasonable person, acting in good
faith, to conclude that all material Permits necessary for the lawful conduct
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries following consummation of
the Merger will be issued in the ordinary course and effective as of Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the forgoing provision shall be inapplicable
to the extent that (i) such customary assurances are unavailable solely as a
result of the negative operating history or qualifications of the Parent, or
solely as a result of the negative background of any director(s) or
officers(s) of the Parent, or (ii) the failure to obtain any such Permits
would not, individually or in the aggregate result, or be reasonably likely
to result, in a material adverse effect of Parent.   (f) Closing Consents.
The consents, authorizations, orders, permits and approvals listed on Exhibit
B hereto shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and effect.

Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction or waiver
on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:   (a)
Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on the
Closing Date (without regard to materiality qualifiers contained therein),
except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to
an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date, except where the
failure of the representations and warranties to be true and correct
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of
Parent to such effect.   (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by them under this

None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in Sections 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such party\'s failure to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to Section
6.03.   ARTICLE VIII.  Termination, Amendment and Waiver   Section 8.01
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval:   (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;   (b)
by either Parent or the Company:   (i) if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the nine month anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available
to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such
date;   (ii) if any Restraint having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in effect and shall have
become final and nonappealable;   (iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval
shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting duly
convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;   (c) by
Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or (b) and (B)
is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Company within 30
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach
or failure to perform;   (d) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall
have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.03(a) or (b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured,
by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, within 30 calendar days
following receipt of written notice from the Company of such breach or
failure to perform;   (e) by Parent, if (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall have occurred or (ii) within ten (10) business days of the date
any Takeover Proposal shall have been made or communicated to the Company,
the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have failed to publicly
confirm its recommendation and declaration of advisability of this Agreement
and the Merger; or   (f) by the Company, if the Company Board shall have
exercised its termination rights set forth in Section 5.02(b); provided that
in order for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(f) to be deemed effective, the Company shall have complied with all
provisions of Section 5.02, including the notice provisions therein and paid
the amounts required by Section 8.02.   Section 8.02 Termination Fee and
Shareholder Termination Fee.   (a) In the event that:   (i) this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i),
and after the date of this Agreement a Takeover Proposal shall have been made
or communicated to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of the Company generally and (B) within twelve (12) months after
such termination the Company shall have reached a definitive agreement to
consummate, or shall have consummated a Takeover Proposal; provided that for
purposes of this Clause (B) all references in the definition of Takeover
Proposal to 20% shall instead refer to 50%;   (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f);   (iii) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (A) after
the date of this Agreement a Takeover Proposal shall have been made or
communicated to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of the Company generally and (B) within twelve (12) months after
such termination the Company shall have reached a definitive agreement to
consummate, or shall have consummated a Takeover Proposal; provided that for
purposes of this Clause (B) all references in the definition of Takeover
Proposal to 20% shall instead refer to 50%; or   (iv) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e),  then the Company shall
(1) in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clauses (i) or (iii)
of this Section 8.02(a), upon the earlier of the date of such definitive
agreement and such consummation of a Takeover Proposal, (2) in the case of a
Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.02(a), on
the date of such termination, or (3) in the case of a Termination Fee payable
pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section 8.02(a), on the date that is two
business days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a fee equal
to $45,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day
funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event that the Company
proposes to terminate this Agreement at a time when the Termination Fee is
payable, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee as described above
prior to such termination by the Company. In case of the termination of this
Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii), then the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable out of pocket expenses
(including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of financing sources,
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants) incurred
prior to the date of such termination by Parent or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, promptly upon the Company\'s receipt of reasonable documentation of
such expenses; provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision herein
to the contrary, the liability of the Company pursuant to this provision
shall not exceed $5,000,000 (the "Shareholder Termination Fee"). In the case
of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section
8.02(a), the parties hereby agree that the Termination Fee (including the
right to receive such fee or the payment of such fee) shall not limit in any
respect any rights or remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub relating to
any willful breach or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement resulting, directly or
indirectly, in the right to receive the Termination Fee. In the event
that either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii)
and (i) after the date of this Agreement a Takeover Proposal shall have been
made or communicated to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of the Company generally and (ii) within twelve (12) months
after such termination the Company shall have reached a definitive agreement
to consummate, or shall have consummated a Takeover Proposal, then the
Company shall, upon the earlier of the date of such definitive agreement and
such consummation of a Takeover Proposal, pay Parent the Termination Fee,
less any portion of the Shareholder Termination Fee previously paid by the
Company to Parent pursuant to this Section 8.02, by wire transfer of same-day
funds; provided that for purposes of clause (ii) of this sentence, all
references in the definition of Takeover Proposal to 20% shall instead refer
to 50%. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company in no event shall be obligated to pay more than one such
Termination Fee with respect to all such agreements and occurrences and such
termination.   (b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in Section 8.02(a) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 8.02(a), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   Section 8.03
Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement

such termination; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
any liability for any material breach hereof.   Section 8.04 Amendment.
This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or
after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; provided, however, that

such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.   Section 8.05 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in

not constitute a waiver of such rights.   Section 8.06 Procedure for

the Company Board, as applicable, or the duly authorized committee or other
