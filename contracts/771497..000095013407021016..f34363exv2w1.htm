</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October&nbsp;7, 2007 (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), is
by and among OneSource Services Inc., an international business company formed under the laws of
Belize (&#147;<U>Target</U>&#148;), ABM Industries Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;),
and OCo Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>RECITALS:</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of Target, Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective companies and their equity holders to complete the strategic
business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Target will, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;) with and
into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving company in the Merger (the &#147;<U>Surviving
Company</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;As an inducement and condition to Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s entry into this Agreement,
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Rivaz Overseas Corp., a
corporation formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (the &#147;<U>Shareholder</U>&#148;), is
entering into an agreement with Parent in the form of <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> (the &#147;<U>Shareholder
Agreement</U>&#148;) pursuant to which, among other things, the Shareholder has irrevocably agreed to
vote or execute a written consent in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;The parties desire to make or enter into, as the case may be, certain representations,
warranties and covenants in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to
the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <U>The Merger; Pre-Merger Actions</U>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the &#147;<U>Delaware
Act</U>&#148;) and the Belize International Business Companies Act (the &#147;<U>IBCA</U>&#148;), at the
Effective Time, Target will merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub will be the surviving
company in the Merger and will continue its limited liability company existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Target under
the laws of Belize will cease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <U>Effective Time</U>. The Merger will become effective as set forth in (a)&nbsp;the
certificate of merger (the &#147;<U>Certificate of Merger</U>&#148;) that will be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date and (b)&nbsp;the articles of merger (the
&#147;<U>Articles of Merger</U>&#148;) that will be filed with the Registrar of International Business

effects set forth in Section&nbsp;18-209 of the Delaware Act and IBCA Section&nbsp;87(3).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 <U>Conversion of Target Ordinary Shares</U>. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Target, Merger Sub or the holder of any of the
following securities:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Each ordinary share of $0.10 per share of Target issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the &#147;<U>Target Ordinary Shares</U>&#148;), except for Target Ordinary Shares
owned by Target or Parent and for Dissenting Shares, will be automatically converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Aggregate Price divided by the number
of Target Ordinary Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (other than Target
Ordinary Shares owned by Target or Parent) (such quotient, the &#147;<U>Merger Consideration</U>&#148;).
For purposes hereof, the &#147;<U>Aggregate Price</U>&#148; means (i) $365&nbsp;million, less (ii)&nbsp;the
Contribution Amount, but only if Target elects the Spin-Off Election and consummates for Spin-Off
(each as defined on <U>Schedule&nbsp;1.10</U>) pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10 in accordance with the terms
thereof, plus (iii)&nbsp;if applicable, the Price Increase payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.1.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;All of the Target Ordinary Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article&nbsp;I will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously
representing any such Target Ordinary Shares (each a &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) will thereafter
represent only the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the number of
Target Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificate and (ii)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration.
Certificates previously representing Target Ordinary Shares will be exchanged for such Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2, without any
interest thereon.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all
Target Ordinary Shares that are owned by Target or Parent will be cancelled and will cease to exist
and no stock of Parent or other consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5 <U>Merger Sub Membership Interests</U>. Each membership interest of Merger Sub (the
&#147;<U>Merger Sub Membership Interests</U>&#148;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into one membership interest of the Surviving Company, and the
Surviving Company will thereby become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

does not adversely affect the amount of the Merger Consideration or the ability of Target to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (b)&nbsp;Target will not be deemed to have breached
any of its representations or warranties herein if and to the extent such breach results from such
election), the Merger may alternatively be structured so that Target is merged with and into Parent
or any other direct or indirect Parent Subsidiary or so that Merger Sub (or any other direct or
indirect Parent Subsidiary) is merged with and into Target. In the event of such an election, the
parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
election.

be deemed to have breached any of its representations and warranties herein if and to the extent
such breach results from such election), Target may engage in the transactions set forth on

Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates (other than
certificates evidencing Target Ordinary Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.4(c),
Dissenting Shares or Direct Pay Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably
agreed to by the parties (which will specify, among other things, that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment therefor. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange
and cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such properly completed and duly executed
letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates will be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration into which the Target Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificate or
Certificates have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. At the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of a
Certificate or Certificates representing Direct Pay Shares to Parent for exchange and cancellation,
together with such transmittal documentation as may be reasonably requested by Parent, the
applicable Direct Pay Shareholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which
the Direct Pay Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the payment
instructions set forth opposite such Direct Pay Shareholder&#146;s name on Schedule&nbsp;2.1, and Parent will
cause such Certificate or Certificates so surrendered to forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;In the event of a transfer of ownership of Target Ordinary Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of Target, such payment may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Target Ordinary Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably requested by Parent to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence to
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that any transfer Tax has been paid or is not
payable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Target
or the Surviving Company of the Target Ordinary Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Target Ordinary Shares that occurred
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Parent or the Surviving Company, they will be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article&nbsp;II, subject to applicable law,
in the case of Dissenting Shares. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of the
depositary interests representing the Target Ordinary Shares created pursuant to a deed poll by

acknowledges that it does not presently anticipate that the Surviving Company, Parent or the
Paying Agent will be required to deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Target Ordinary Shares any amounts under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that any such withholdings are required, each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the Paying Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Target Ordinary Shares such amounts as are required (but only to the
extent required) to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Target Ordinary Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;Thirty days following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will provide the Surviving
Company (with a copy to the current company secretary of Target of the address for Target set forth
in Section&nbsp;9.4) with a list of holders of record of Target Ordinary Shares as of the Effective Time
showing which such holders have properly surrendered Certificates for payment in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.2 and which such holders have not so surrendered
Certificates. The Surviving Company will thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with such individual in contacting those holders that have not so surrendered their Certificates
and provide them with further instructions on how to so surrender such Certificates. Any portion
of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of Target as of the first
anniversary of the Effective Time will be paid to Parent and the Surviving Company. Any former
shareholders of Target who have not theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;II will thereafter look
only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each
Target Ordinary Share, as the case may be, that such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Target, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other person will be liable to
any former holder of Target Ordinary Shares for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

amount as Parent may determine is

properly in writing to elect to dissent from the Merger in accordance with Section&nbsp;91 of the IBCA
(collectively, the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) will not be converted into, or represent the right

Section&nbsp;91, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who have failed to perfect or
who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under
such Section&nbsp;91 will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;1.4. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section&nbsp;2.3, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of
any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholder&#146;s Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section&nbsp;91 of the IBCA will cease. Target may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.
