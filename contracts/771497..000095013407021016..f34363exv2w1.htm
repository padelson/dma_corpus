AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 7, 2007 (this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among OneSource Services Inc., an international business company formed under the laws of Belize (" _Target_ "), ABM Industries Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and OCo Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). 

  

RECITALS: 

   

 A. The Boards of Directors of Target, Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their equity holders to complete the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Target will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "). 

  

 B. As an inducement and condition to Parents and Merger Subs entry into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Rivaz Overseas Corp., a corporation formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (the " _Shareholder_ "), is entering into an agreement with Parent in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the " _Shareholder Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things, the Shareholder has irrevocably agreed to vote or execute a written consent in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. 

  

 C. The parties desire to make or enter into, as the case may be, certain representations, warranties and covenants in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _The Merger; Pre-Merger Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _Delaware Act_ ") and the Belize International Business Companies Act (the " _IBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Target will merge with and into Merger Sub. Merger Sub will be the surviving company in the Merger and will continue its limited liability company existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Target under the laws of Belize will cease. 

  

 1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger will become effective as set forth in (a) the certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date and (b) the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that will be filed with the Registrar of International Business Companies of Belize (the " _Registrar_ ") on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " 

   ##### 

  

 

will be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in
the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger. 

   

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 18-209 of the Delaware Act and IBCA Section 87(3). 

  

 1.4 _Conversion of Target Ordinary Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Target, Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Each ordinary share of $0.10 per share of Target issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Target Ordinary Shares_ "), except for Target Ordinary Shares owned by Target or Parent and for Dissenting Shares, will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Aggregate Price divided by the number of Target Ordinary Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (other than Target Ordinary Shares owned by Target or Parent) (such quotient, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). For purposes hereof, the " _Aggregate Price_ " means (i) $365 million, less (ii) the Contribution Amount, but only if Target elects the Spin-Off Election and consummates for Spin-Off (each as defined on _Schedule 1.10_) pursuant to Section 1.10 in accordance with the terms thereof, plus (iii) if applicable, the Price Increase payable pursuant to Section 9.1. 

  

 (b) All of the Target Ordinary Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such Target Ordinary Shares (each a " _Certificate_ ") will thereafter represent only the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Target Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger Consideration. Certificates previously representing Target Ordinary Shares will be exchanged for such Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all Target Ordinary Shares that are owned by Target or Parent will be cancelled and will cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 1.5 _Merger Sub Membership Interests_. Each membership interest of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Membership Interests_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one membership interest of the Surviving Company, and the Surviving Company will thereby become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 1.6 _Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Certificate_ ") will be the 

   ##### 

  

 

certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law. 

   

 1.7 _Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub will be the limited liability company agreement (the " _Merger Sub LLC Agreement_ ") of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms thereof. 

  

 1.8 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Company until the next annual meeting (or the earlier of their resignation or removal) and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) The officers of Target immediately prior the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 1.9 _Alternative Structures_. At Parents election (provided that (a) such election does not adversely affect the amount of the Merger Consideration or the ability of Target to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) Target will not be deemed to have breached any of its representations or warranties herein if and to the extent such breach results from such election), the Merger may alternatively be structured so that Target is merged with and into Parent or any other direct or indirect Parent Subsidiary or so that Merger Sub (or any other direct or indirect Parent Subsidiary) is merged with and into Target. In the event of such an election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such election. 

  

 1.10 _Spin-Off Election_. At Targets election (provided that (a) such election does not increase the amount of the Merger Consideration or affect the ability of Target to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the timing thereof and (b) Parent and Merger Sub will not be deemed to have breached any of its representations and warranties herein if and to the extent such breach results from such election), Target may engage in the transactions set forth on  _Schedule 1.10_, but only on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (the " _Spin-Off Election_ "). 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

 2.1 _Payment for Target Ordinary Shares_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to each of Target and Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for payment in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, immediately available funds in an aggregate amount equal to the Aggregate Price, less any amounts payable in accordance with this Article II to the holders of Target Ordinary Shares set forth on _Schedule 2.1_ (as may be amended from 

   ##### 

  

 

time to time provided that the number of Direct Pay Shareholders will not
exceed 25) (the " _Direct Pay Shareholders_ " and the Target Ordinary Shares
held by such Direct Pay Shareholders, the " _Direct Pay Shares_ "). The funds
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.1 are referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Payment Fund_ ". 

   

 2.2 _Payment Procedures_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates (other than certificates evidencing Target Ordinary Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.4(c), Dissenting Shares or Direct Pay Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed to by the parties (which will specify, among other things, that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment therefor. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which the Target Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. At the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates representing Direct Pay Shares to Parent for exchange and cancellation, together with such transmittal documentation as may be reasonably requested by Parent, the applicable Direct Pay Shareholder will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration into which the Direct Pay Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates have been converted pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the payment instructions set forth opposite such Direct Pay Shareholders name on Schedule 2.1, and Parent will cause such Certificate or Certificates so surrendered to forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. 

  

 (b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Target Ordinary Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Target, such payment may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Target Ordinary Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably requested by Parent to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence to establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that any transfer Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (c) After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Target or the Surviving Company of the Target Ordinary Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Target Ordinary Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Parent or the Surviving Company, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable law, in the case of Dissenting Shares. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of the depositary interests representing the Target Ordinary Shares created pursuant to a deed poll by Capita IRG Trustees Limited, dated February 15, 2006. At the Effective 

   ##### 

  

 

Time, the depositary interests will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration to which Capita IRG Trustees Limited becomes entitled pursuant
to this Article II in respect of the Target Ordinary Shares which such
depositary interests represent, subject to applicable law, in the case of
Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (d) Based on the information available to it as of the date hereof, each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it does not presently anticipate that the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent will be required to deduct or withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Target Ordinary Shares any amounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such withholdings are required, each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Target Ordinary Shares such amounts as are required (but only to the extent required) to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Target Ordinary Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 (e) Thirty days following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will provide the Surviving Company (with a copy to the current company secretary of Target of the address for Target set forth in Section 9.4) with a list of holders of record of Target Ordinary Shares as of the Effective Time showing which such holders have properly surrendered Certificates for payment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.2 and which such holders have not so surrendered Certificates. The Surviving Company will thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with such individual in contacting those holders that have not so surrendered their Certificates and provide them with further instructions on how to so surrender such Certificates. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of Target as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be paid to Parent and the Surviving Company. Any former shareholders of Target who have not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each Target Ordinary Share, as the case may be, that such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Target, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other person will be liable to any former holder of Target Ordinary Shares for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration into which the Target Ordinary Shares represented by
such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (g) Any profit or loss or interest or other income resulting from any investments of the Payment Fund will be for the account of Parent and be paid to Parent on the earlier of the first anniversary of the Effective Time or the full payment of the Payment Fund. 

  

 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under Section 91 of the IBCA, any Target Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a shareholder who has demanded properly in writing to elect to dissent from the Merger in accordance with Section 91 of the IBCA (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such shareholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 91, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section 91 will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in the manner provided in Section 1.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 91 of the IBCA will cease. Target may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current and former directors or officers of Target or any Target Subsidiary as provided in the Target Memorandum or Target Articles (or any similar constituent document of any Target Subsidiary) will survive the Merger and continue in effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six years following the Closing Date. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each individual who is now, or becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries or who is serving at the request of the Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the " _Target Indemnified Parties_ ") against any losses, claims, damages, 

   ##### 

  

 

liabilities, costs, expenses (including reimbursement for reasonable fees and
expenses incurred in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Target Indemnified Party), judgments,
fines and, subject to approval by Parent, amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation to which such Target Indemnified Party is, or is threatened
to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such individual is or was a
director or officer of Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries or (ii) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Parent will cause to be maintained in effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained at the Effective Time by Target (the " _Target D andO Policy_") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts and may cause coverage to be extended under the Target DandO Policy by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy, in each case containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than the Target DandO Policy) with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _that_ in no event will Parent be required to expend in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by Target for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent will cause to be maintained the most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 will survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Target Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and Target will promptly advise the other of any change or event (a) having a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Target Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or (b) that it believes results or would be reasonably expected to result in (i) a failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) or 7.3(a) or (b) or (ii) a Belize Tax liability arising as a result of the Merger or the Spin-Off; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) no such notification will affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement and (B) a failure to comply with this Section 6.7 will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Parent Material Adverse Effect or Target Material Adverse Effect, as applicable, or breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied. 

  

 6.8 _No Solicitation_. None of Target, the Target Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of Target or any the Target Subsidiaries will directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage or facilitate 

   #####

to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding, or participate in any
discussions regarding, or enter into any agreement regarding, any merger,
share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital
stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions (each,
an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ") involving Target or any of the Target
Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
subject in any such case to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
Target under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation in
the immediately preceding clause of this sentence will have no effect on
the Shareholders obligations under the Shareholder Agreement or the Target
Shareholder Approval. Target will notify Parent promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request
for nonpublic information relating to Target or any of the Target
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Target or
the Board of Directors of any Target Subsidiary by any person or entity that
informs the Target Board or any Target Subsidiary that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Target and the Target
Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent) conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and will use reasonable best
efforts to cause all persons other than Parent who have been furnished
confidential information regarding Target in connection with the solicitation
of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months
prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information.
Target agrees not to, and to cause the Target Subsidiaries not to, release
any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which Target or the Target Subsidiaries is or may become a party,
and will immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that
may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any
person to make an Acquisition Proposal.

Prior to the Closing, Target will deliver to Parent a signed IRS Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, with respect to the entities set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ (the " _Electing Entities_ "), consenting to an election by each of such Electing Entities to be disregarded as an entity separate from its sole owner effective on the day prior to the Effective Time.
