to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to this ___Section 2.4(c)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Certificate evidencing Acquiror Common
Shares is held in electronic form, then surrender of such Certificate will be

(d) The Holders of such Company LLC Interests will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor such Holder's portion of the PCT Merger Shares

Holder's portion of the PCT Merger Shares that the holders of Company LLC
Interests were entitled to receive in respect of such interests pursuant to
this ___Section 2.4(d)_.

aggregate of 50% of the Earnout Shares; and

such Change in Control is equal to or greater than $10.00 per share, Holdings
will, no later than immediately prior to the consummation of such Change in

recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Holdings Common Shares, occurring on or after

obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.7(f)_.

Section 4.8.   _Trust Account_. As of November 9, 2020, Acquiror has
$76,528,652.26 (less, as of the Closing, payments to be paid to the Redeeming
Stockholders) in the trust account established by Acquiror for the benefit of
its Acquiror Public Stockholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "
_Trust Account_ "), and such monies are invested in "government
securities" (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended), having a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations, and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of May 4, 2020, between Acquiror and the Trustee (the "
_Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and
effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms and has not been amended
or modified. There are no separate agreements, side letters or other
agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the
Acquiror SEC Documents to be inaccurate in any material respect or that would
entitle any Person (other than payments to Roth and C-H for deferred
underwriting commissions as described in the Acquiror SEC Documents and
the Acquiror Public Stockholders who elect to redeem their shares of Acquiror
Common Stock pursuant to Acquiror's certificate of incorporation), to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except (x) to pay income
and other Tax obligations from any interest income earned in the Trust
Account or (y) to redeem Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Acquiror's Organizational Documents and the Trust Agreement.
Acquiror has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it
under, and is not in material default or delinquent in performance or any
other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement,
and, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, no event has occurred which, with due
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder. There
are no Proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account. Since May 4,
2020, Acquiror has not released any money from the Trust Account (other than
interest income earned on the principal held in the Trust Account as permitted
by the Trust Agreement). As of the RH Effective Time, the obligations of
Acquiror to dissolve or liquidate pursuant to Acquiror's
Organizational Documents will terminate, and as of the RH Effective Time,
Acquiror will have no obligation whatsoever pursuant to
Acquiror's Organizational Documents to dissolve and liquidate the assets of
Acquiror, and following the RH Effective Time, no Acquiror Stockholder will
be entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent
such Acquiror Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder. Acquiror has no reason
to believe that, as of the RH Effective Time, any of the conditions to the use
of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the
Trust Account will not be available to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates on
the Closing Date, other than with respect to satisfy any redemption payments
owed to Redeeming Stockholders.

  



  

Section 4.9.   _Listing_. Acquiror Units, Acquiror Common Stock and
Acquiror Warrants are listed on Nasdaq, with trading tickers ROCHU, ROCH and

Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror by Nasdaq with respect to any intention
by such entity to prohibit or terminate the listing of Acquiror Units,
Acquiror Common Stock or Acquiror Warrants on Nasdaq.

furnished by Acquiror with the SEC since Acquiror's formation under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, together with any amendments,
restatements or supplements thereto (the " _Acquiror SEC Documents_ ").
Acquiror SEC Documents were prepared in all material respects in accordance
with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Acquiror SEC Documents did not at the time they were filed
with the SEC (except to the extent that information contained in any Acquiror
SEC Document has been or is revised or superseded by a later filed Acquiror
SEC Document, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As
used in this ___Section 4.12_, the term "file" will be broadly construed to
include any manner in which a document or information is furnished,
supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

  



  

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any
notes thereto) contained in the Acquiror SEC Documents (i) was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and in accordance
with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for
public companies and (ii) fairly presents, in all material respects, the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Acquiror as at the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein.

  



  

(c)  Acquiror has timely filed all certifications and statements
required by (x) Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (y) 18

Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and

responsible for the preparation of Acquiror's SEC filings and other public
disclosure documents.

(e)  Acquiror maintains a standard system of accounting established
and administered in accordance with GAAP. Acquiror has designed and maintains
a system of internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Acquiror maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable

(g)  Neither Acquiror nor, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, any manager,
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
Acquiror has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Acquiror or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Acquiror has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney representing
Acquiror, whether or not employed by Acquiror, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Acquiror or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
to Acquiror's board of directors (or any committee thereof) or to any director
or officer of Acquiror. Since Acquiror's inception, there have been no

Documents, there is no agreement, commitment, or Order binding upon Acquiror
or to which Acquiror is a party that has or would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of prohibiting or impairing any business practice of Acquiror,
any acquisition of property by Acquiror or the conduct of business by
Acquiror as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the
Closing, other than such effects, individually or in the aggregate, which have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect or an adverse effect on the ability of Acquiror to enter into

venture, business, trust or other entity.

  



  

Section 4.14.   _Acquiror Contracts_. No Acquiror Party is a party to any

which Acquiror is a party that were entered into in the ordinary course of its
business and the Subscription Agreements).

  



  

Section 4.15.   _Employees_. No Acquiror Party has ever had any
employees. Other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the officers and directors of any Acquiror Party in connection with activities
on an Acquiror Party's behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the
amount of cash held by Acquiror outside of the Trust Account, no Acquiror
Party has any unsatisfied Liability with respect to any officer or director
of the Acquiror Parties.

Party or (ii) any record or beneficial owner of the outstanding equity
interests of an Acquiror Party.

decree, injunction or Order of any Governmental Authority. There are no
Proceedings (at Law or in equity) or investigations pending or, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, threatened, seeking to or that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, hinder, modify, delay or challenge the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.18.   _Organization of Merger Sub Corp, Merger Sub LLC and

formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and
has no assets or Liabilities of any nature other than those incident to the
formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.19.   _PIPE Financing_. In connection with the PIPE Placement,
Acquiror has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of
each Subscription Agreement executed on or prior to the date hereof, pursuant
to which certain Persons, evidenced in such Subscription Agreements, who have
committed to purchasing Acquiror Common Stock (on a transitory basis, then
immediately exchangeable for Holdings Common Shares pursuant to the RH
Merger) in connection with the Transactions (each, a " _PIPE Investor_ "). To
the Knowledge of Acquiror, each Subscription Agreement is in full force and
effect and is legal, valid and binding upon Acquiror and the applicable PIPE
Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, no
Subscription Agreement has been withdrawn, terminated, amended or modified
since the date of delivery hereunder and, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, no
such withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated, and
the commitments contained in each Subscription Agreement have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded by the applicable PIPE Investor in any
respect. There are no side letters or Contracts to which Acquiror or Merger
Sub Corp is a party related to the provision or funding, as applicable, of the
purchases contemplated by each Subscription Agreement or the Transactions
other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, each
Subscription Agreement or any other agreement entered into (or to be entered
into) in connection with the Transactions delivered to the Company. Acquiror
has, and to the Knowledge of Acquiror, each PIPE Investor has, complied with
all of its obligations under each Subscription Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the consummation of the
purchases set forth in each Subscription Agreement, other than as expressly
set forth in each Subscription Agreement as of the date hereof. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Acquiror or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror as of the date hereof, any PIPE
Investor, (ii) assuming the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and
_Section 8.2_ will be satisfied, constitute a failure to satisfy a condition
on the part of Acquiror or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror as of the date

Agreement being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof,
assuming the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ will
be satisfied, Acquiror has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the consummation of the purchases under each Subscription Agreement will not
be satisfied, and, as of the date hereof, Acquiror is not aware of the
existence of any fact or event that would or would reasonably be expected to
cause such conditions not to be satisfied.

is or may be required in connection with the Transactions;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in each case (i) no such notification will affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, (ii) no such notification
will be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Letter or to cure any
breach of any covenant or agreement or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty and (iii) the failure to comply with this _Section 5.5_ will not
result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing
in _Article VIII_, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement
under  _Article IX_, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure
would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

Directors_.

reasonable efforts to obtain, in consultation with Acquiror, and pay for a
"tail" officers' and directors' liability insurance policy with a claims
period of six years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage

less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company as the
Company's existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _D andO
Tail Policy_"). Acquiror will bear the cost of the DandO Tail Policy as
an Acquiror Transaction Expense, provided, that (i) Acquiror will not be
responsible for an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company for its existing officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy. During the term of the DandO Tail Policy, Holdings will not
(and will cause the PCT Surviving Company not to) take any action
following the Closing to cause the DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any
provision therein to be amended or waived and (ii) if any claim is asserted
or made within such six year period, any insurance required to be maintained
under this ___Section 5.6_ will be continued in respect of such claim until
the final disposition thereof.

defend and hold harmless, as set forth as of the date hereof in

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who, at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such
individual's heirs, executors or administrators, the " _Indemnified Persons_
") with respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals'
services as officers, directors, employees or agents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the execution of, and the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that any such Indemnified Person is or becomes involved, in any
capacity, in any Proceeding in connection with any matter for which
indemnification is available pursuant to the foregoing sentence, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Holdings, from and after the
Effective Time, will pay, as incurred, such Indemnified Person's legal and
other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation)
incurred in connection therewith, within 30 days after any request for
advancement (including attorneys' fees which may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing this ___Section 5.6_), subject to receipt of
an undertaking from such Indemnified Person to repay such advancement if such
Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of
the Company, Holdings and Acquiror contained in this ___Section 5.6_ will be
binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company, Holdings and Acquiror.
In the event the Company, Holdings or Acquiror, or any of their respective
successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company, Holdings or Acquiror, as the case may
be, honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this
___Section 5.6_.

  



  

(d)  This ___Section 5.6_ will survive the consummation of
the Transactions, is intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by each
Indemnified Person and their respective successors, heirs and
representatives, and will not be amended in any manner that is adverse to an
Indemnified Person.

terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE IX_, neither the Company, on the one

and use reasonable best efforts to cause, each of their respective
members, officers, directors, Affiliates, managers, consultants, employees,
representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage,
solicit, initiate, engage, participate, enter into discussions or negotiations
with any Person concerning any Alternative Transaction, (ii) take any other
action intended or designed to facilitate the efforts of any Person
relating to a possible Alternative Transaction or (iii) approve, recommend or
enter into any Alternative Transaction or any Contract related to any

for, or an indication of interest in entering into, an Alternative
Transaction (including any revision, modification or follow-up with respect
thereto), communicated in writing to the Company or Acquiror or any of their
respective representatives or agents (each, an " _Alternative Proposal_
"), such party will as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one
Business Day after receipt) advise the other Party orally and in writing of
such Alternative Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
Person making such Alternative Proposal.

  



  

   

\- 47 -

 



    



  

Section 7.2.   _Proxy Statement; Acquiror Stockholders ' Meeting._

  



  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than
five Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Acquiror and Holdings
will, in consultation with the Company, prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4 (which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) for the purposes of
(i) registering under the Securities Act the Holdings Common Shares issuable
hereunder, (ii) providing Acquiror's stockholders with the opportunity to
redeem their Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the Transactions and
(iii) soliciting proxies from Acquiror Stockholders to obtain the Acquiror
Stockholder Approval at a meeting of the Acquiror Stockholders to be called
and held for such purpose (the " _Acquiror Stockholders ' Meeting_"). As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Acquiror and Holdings will, in consultation with the Company, prepare and
file any other filings required under, and in accordance with, the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act, the applicable Nasdaq listing rules or any other
Laws relating to the Transactions (collectively, the " _Other Filings_
"). Holdings or Acquiror, as applicable, will notify the Company promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other
Filing or for additional information. As promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, Holdings or Acquiror, as applicable, will provide the
Company and its counsel notice and a copy of all written correspondence (or,
to the extent such correspondence is oral, a complete summary thereof),
including any comments from the SEC or its staff, between Acquiror, Holdings
or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing. Holdings and
Acquiror will permit the Company and its counsel to review the Form S-4, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto and will consult with the Company and its advisors, in good faith,
concerning such correspondence from the SEC with respect thereto, and will
reasonably consider and take into account the reasonable suggestions, comments
or opinions of the Company and its advisors, and will not file the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto or any response letters to any comments from the SEC without the prior
written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to prior
compliance with the notice and cooperation obligations set forth in this
___Section 7.2(a)_, Holdings or Acquiror, as applicable, will be permitted
to make such filing or response in the absence of such consent if the
basis of the Company's failure to consent is the Company's unwillingness to
permit the inclusion in such filing or response of information that, based on
the advice of outside counsel to Acquiror, is required by the SEC and United
States securities Laws to be included therein. Whenever any event occurs
which would reasonably be expected to result in the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus containing any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, Holdings, Acquiror or the Company, as the case may be, will
promptly inform the other Parties of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing
to stockholders of Acquiror, an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

  



  

   

\- 48 -

 



    



  

(b)  The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be sent to the Acquiror
Stockholders as soon as practicable after the date on which all comments to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus have been cleared (but in any event, within
three Business Days following such date) for the purpose of soliciting
proxies from holders of Acquiror Common Stock to vote at the Acquiror
Stockholders' Meeting in favor of: (i) the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Mergers and the other Transactions; (ii) approval of
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Holdings; (iii)
approval of the Holdings equity compensation plan in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the " _Holdings Equity Compensation Plan_ "),
(iv) approval of issuances of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the
Subscription Agreements, to the extent required by Nasdaq Listing Rules
5635(a) and (d), and (v) the adjournment of the Acquiror Stockholders'
Meeting (the matters described in clauses (i) through (v), are referred to as
the " _Voting Matters_ " and approval of the Voting Matters by the Acquiror
Required Vote of Acquiror Stockholders at the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting
or any postponement or adjournment thereof is referred to as the " _Acquiror
Stockholder Approval_ "). Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to
hold the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting by January 25, 2021. Acquiror will
keep the Company reasonably informed regarding all matters relating to the
Voting Matters and the Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting, including by promptly
furnishing any voting or proxy solicitation reports received by Acquiror in
respect of such matters and similar updates regarding any redemptions in
respect of the Offer. Concurrently with the dissemination of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Acquiror will commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act) an offer to the Acquiror Public Stockholders to
redeem all or a portion of their Acquiror Public Shares, up to that number of
Acquiror Public Shares that would permit Acquiror to maintain net tangible
assets of at least $5,000,001, all in accordance with and as required by
Acquiror's Organizational Documents, applicable Law, and any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC (the " _Offer_ "). In accordance with Acquiror's
Organizational Documents, the proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used
for the redemption of Acquiror Public Shares held by Acquiror Public
Stockholders who have elected to redeem such Acquiror Public Shares.

  



  

(c)  Acquiror will extend the Offer for any minimum period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, Nasdaq or the
respective staff thereof that is applicable to the Offer, and pursuant to
Acquiror's Organizational Documents. Nothing in this _Section _ _7.2(c)_
will (i) impose any obligation on Acquiror to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date or (ii) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any
manner the right of Acquiror to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
___ARTICLE IX_.

  



  

(d)  If Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to the PIPE Financing
is not registered on the Form S-4, within ten days following the filing of
the Form S-4, Acquiror will file a registration statement on Form S-1 (or
other applicable form) with respect to the resale of Acquiror Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the PIPE Financing, and Acquiror will take all or any
action require or advisable under any applicable Law in connection with the
issuance of Acquiror Public Shares to the subscribers in the PIPE Financing
at or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the

the extent required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or

proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods or obtain required approvals, as applicable under Antitrust

Company will, in connection with its efforts to obtain all requisite
approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under any Antitrust
Law, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other Party or its Affiliates in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by private Persons, (ii) keep the other

agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order or ruling or statute, rule or regulation that would
adversely affect the ability of the Parties to consummate the
Transactions, to use reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

each of Acquiror and the Company will take all such reasonable steps (to the
extent permitted under applicable Law), including the board of directors of
Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, adopting resolutions consistent with

derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by
each individual who may become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 7.7.   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Following the Closing, Holdings will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
another Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation includes the
retention and (upon such other Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

  



  

(b)  All transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement
will be borne by each Person that is responsible for such Taxes
under applicable Law. Holdings and each applicable Person will cooperate in
filing, when required by applicable Law, all necessary documentation and Tax
Returns with respect to such transfer Taxes.

  



  

(c)  Based on the applicable corporate law requiring the actual
issuance of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the PIPE Placement, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the PIPE Investors' beneficial ownership of the
Acquiror Common Stock will be disregarded as transitory, and the PIPE
Placement will be treated as transferred by the PIPE Investors to Holdings for
Holdings Common Shares as part of the same plan as the transfer of other
property to Holdings for Holdings Common Shares, in a single integrated
transaction that satisfies the requirements of Section 351 of the Code.
Holdings and its Subsidiaries will report the exchanges resulting from the
Mergers as nonrecognition transactions under either (i) Section 351 of the
Code or (ii) a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of
the Code and Section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the
Code, as applicable (collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), unless
otherwise required under applicable Law. This Agreement constitutes a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).
The Parties will not, and will cause their Affiliates to not, treat or report
the Transactions in a manner inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment
unless required to do so pursuant to a "final determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code. From and after the date of this
Agreement, none of the Parties will, nor will they permit any of their
Affiliates to, knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken or
omit to take any action which could cause the transactions to fail to qualify
for, or fail to be reported in a manner consistent with, the Intended Tax
Treatment.

made by such provisions apply to any income Tax Return of the Company with
respect to any Tax period beginning on or before December 31, 2017. The
Parties agree that if the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") (or
applicable state Governmental Authority) issues a notice of final partnership
adjustment assessing an "imputed underpayment" against the Company with
respect to any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after December 31,
2017 and ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or any Tax period beginning
on or before December 31, 2017 for which an election under Section 1101(g)(4)
of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was made, the Company will make the
election under Section 6226 of the Code (or any similar provision of Law) and
the partnership representative and each Party agrees to cooperate, and to
cause its respective Affiliates and the "partnership representative" and
"designated individual" (as those terms are used in Section 6223 of the Code
and Treasury Regulation Section 301.6223-1(b)(3) (or any similar provision of
Law)) of the Company, to cooperate, with the Company and its Affiliates, in

requested by the Company and assisting the Company in the preparation of any
statements or other information required to be provided to the IRS or any
other Person as required by Section 6226 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (or any similar provision of Law). With
respect to any income tax audit or other tax proceeding of the Company for
which the Company is treated as a fiscally transparent entity, (i) the Person
designated as the "partnership representative" on the 2019 (or if different,
2020) United States federal income tax return of the Company will be entitled
to control such audit or other tax proceeding (the " _Partnership
Representative_ "), (ii) the Partnership Representative will be designated as
the "tax matters partner" (as defined in Section 6231 of the Code (prior to
amendment by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) or any similar provision of
Law) and the "partnership representative" (as defined in Section 6223 of the
Code (after amendment by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) or any similar
provision of Law) of the Company, as applicable, (iii) the Partnership
Representative may select any "designated individual" (as that term is used in
Treasury Regulation Section 301.6223-1(b)(3) or any similar provision of
Law), and (iv) the Parties and their Affiliates will cooperate in so
designating the Partnership Representative as the "tax matter partner" and
"partnership representative" of the Company and, as reasonably requested by
the Partnership Representative, will cooperate with the Partnership
Representative in connection with any such audit or other tax proceeding.

(f)  Prior to the Closing Date, the Company may, at its sole
discretion, file an election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3 to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal Tax purposes, and
such election, if made, will be effective prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(g)  The Parties agree that the Partnership Representative will be
