(d) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company will mail or will cause to be
mailed to each record holder of (i) Certificates that represented as of the
Effective Time outstanding shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, (ii)
issued and outstanding Options and (iii) issued and outstanding Warrants, a
letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, only upon proper surrender of the Certificates, delivery of an
option cancellation agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ (" _Option
Cancellation Agreement_ ") or delivery of a warrant cancellation agreement in
the form attached as _Exhibit E_ (" _Warrant Cancellation Agreement_ "), as
applicable, together with such Letter of Transmittal properly completed and
duly executed, and a duly executed Stockholder Support Agreement, and
instructions for use in (A) surrendering such Certificates and receiving the
Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration in respect of Common Stock
evidenced thereby or the applicable portion of the Preferred Stock Redemption
Amount in respect of Preferred Stock evidenced thereby, (B) executing such
Option Cancellation Agreement and receiving the Per Option Merger
Consideration in respect of the issued and outstanding Options and (C)
executing such Warrant Cancellation Agreement and receiving the Per Warrant

the surrender to (x) Parent at the Closing or (y) the Paying Agent after the
Closing, of each such Certificate or delivery of an Option Cancellation
Agreement or Warrant Cancellation Agreement, as applicable, a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and a duly executed
Stockholder Support Agreement, the Paying Agent shall (except as provided
below with respect to holders of Options) pay the holder the applicable amount
of consideration that such holder has right to receive pursuant to _Sections
2.7_ , _2.9_ and _2.10_ in consideration therefor after giving effect to any
applicable withholding Taxes, and such Certificate, Option or Warrant, as
applicable, shall forthwith be canceled. For the avoidance of doubt, except
with respect to the payment of the Per Option Merger Consideration to any
Optionholder (which shall be paid as described herein), to the extent a Fully-
Diluted Stockholder has complied with the foregoing at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall pay all
amounts due to such Fully-Diluted Stockholder pursuant to _Sections 2.7_ ,
_2.9_ and _2.10_ on the Closing Date and, to the extent a Fully-Diluted
Stockholder complies with the foregoing after the Effective Time, such
payments shall be made by the Paying Agent within three (3) Business Days.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate, Option or Warrant (other than
Certificates representing Common Stock or Preferred Stock held by the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries or held in the treasury of the Company or
Dissenting Shares) shall represent solely the right to receive the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration (in the case of a Certificate for Common
Stock), the applicable portion of the Preferred Stock Redemption Amount (in
the case of a Certificate for Preferred Stock), the Per Option Merger
Consideration or the Per Warrant Merger Consideration

 



      
 

 



 

relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the delivery of a
Letter of Transmittal and an executed Option Cancellation Agreement, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions therein, by
any Optionholder, such Optionholder shall, following the Closing, receive in
exchange therefor payment of the applicable Per Option Merger Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.9_, after
giving effect to any applicable withholding Taxes, through the Companys
regular payroll payment processes on the next regular payroll date of the
Company that occurs at least three (3) Business Days after the date such
Optionholder delivers a Letter of Transmittal and an executed Option
Cancellation Agreement.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock are presented to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be surrendered and canceled as
provided in this _Article II_. If, after the Effective Time, Option
Cancellation Agreements or Warrant Cancellation Agreements are delivered to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the underlying Options
or Warrants, as applicable, shall be assigned and canceled, as provided in
this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) No interest shall accrue or be paid on the amounts payable upon the
delivery of Certificates, Option Cancellation Agreements, Warrant Cancellation
Agreements, Letters of Transmittal and the Stockholder Support Agreement.

 



 

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and containing customary
indemnification provisions in favor of Parent and/or the Paying Agent
reasonably acceptable to Parent, Parent will, or will cause the Paying Agent
to, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
payments with respect to such Certificate to which such Person is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

(h) If payment of any portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration or Final
Merger Consideration in respect of Common Stock is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name a surrendered certificate of Common Stock
is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the certificate of
Common Stock so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not payable.

 



 

(i) At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, all cash
deposited with the Paying Agent (if the Paying Agent is an entity other than
Parent) pursuant to _Section 2.12(c)(vii)_ that remains undistributed to the
Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
thereafter the affected Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar law) only as general creditors thereof and subject to this
_Article II_. In addition, notwithstanding

 



      
 

 



 

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Representative shall be liable to
any Fully-Diluted Stockholder for any amount delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

2.13 _Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Subsequent to the Closing and subject to _Section 2.13(f)_, the Estimated
Merger Consideration shall, for the purposes of calculating the Final Merger
Consideration, be:

 



 

(i) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Cash exceeds the
Estimated Cash or _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Estimated
Cash exceeds the Final Cash;

 



 

(ii) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Working Capital
exceeds the Estimated Working Capital or _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by
which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Final Working Capital;

 



 

(iii) _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Closing
Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Closing Indebtedness or _increased_ by the
amount (if any) by which the Estimated Closing Indebtedness exceeds the Final
Closing Indebtedness;

 



 

(iv) _decreased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Seller Transaction
Expenses exceeds the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses or _increased_ by
the amount (if any) by which the Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses exceeds
the Final Seller Transaction Expenses; and

 



 

(v) _increased_ by the amount (if any) by which the Final Transaction Tax
Benefits exceeds the Estimated Transaction Tax Benefits or _decreased_ by the
amount (if any) by which the Estimated Transaction Tax Benefits exceeds the
Final Transaction Tax Benefits.

 



 

The Estimated Merger Consideration, as so increased or decreased in accordance
with this _Section 2.13(a)_, shall be the " _Final Merger Consideration_ "
hereunder.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than seventy-five (75)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) prepare a statement of
the calculation of Cash and Working Capital, in each case as of the Closing
Date, together with calculations of the Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Tax
Benefits, the Seller Transaction Expenses and the Final Merger Consideration
(the " _Closing Date Statement_ "), and (ii) deliver the Closing Date
Statement to the Representative. The Closing Date Statement shall be prepared
in accordance with _Section 2.13(g)_.

 



 

(c) In connection with the Representatives review of the Closing Date
Statement, Parent shall permit the Representative and its representatives
reasonable access to books and records, personnel and facilities of the
Company to the extent reasonably necessary to review the Closing Date
Statement. The Representative shall have the right to review the work papers
of Parent underlying or utilized in preparing the Closing Date Statement and
Parents calculation of

 



      
 

 



 

the Final Merger Consideration to the extent reasonably necessary to verify
the accuracy and fairness of the presentation of the Closing Date Statement
and Parents calculation of the Final Merger Consideration in conformity with
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, the Representative shall either inform Parent in writing that the
Closing Date Statement is acceptable or object thereto in writing, setting
forth a specific description of each of its objections to the calculations
prepared by Parent in the Closing Date Statement. If the Representative so
objects and the parties do not resolve such objections on a mutually agreeable
basis within thirty (30) calendar days after Parents receipt of the
Representatives objections, the remaining disputed items shall be resolved
within an additional thirty (30) calendar days by McGladrey, LLP or another
mutually agreed accounting firm (the " _Referral Firm_ "). The Representative
shall make available to Parent (upon request following the giving of any
objection to the Closing Date Statement) the work papers of the Representative
generated in connection with its review of the Closing Date Statement. Upon
the agreement of the parties, a decision of the Referral Firm as set forth in
_clause (e)_ below or if the Representative fails to deliver an objection to
Parent within the first 30-day period referred to above, then the Closing Date
Statement, as adjusted (if applicable) (the " _Final Closing Date Statement_
"), shall be final, conclusive and binding against the parties hereto. The
statements of Cash, Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Tax
Benefits and the statement of Seller Transaction Expenses which were unpaid as
of 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date set forth in the Final Closing
Statement shall be the " _Final Cash_ ", " _Final Working Capital_ ", " _Final
Closing Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Transaction Tax Benefits_ " and " _Final
Seller Transaction Expenses_ " for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(e) In resolving any disputed item, the Referral Firm (i) shall be bound by
the provisions of this _Section 2.13_, (ii) may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Parent or the Representative,
(iii) shall limit its decision to such items as are in dispute and (iv) shall
make its determination based solely on presentations by Parent and the
Representative which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set
forth in this Agreement (i.e. not on the basis of independent review). The
decision of the Referral Firm with respect to any disputed items shall be
final and binding upon Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Representative
and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders. The fees and expenses of the Referral Firm
shall be allocated between Parent and the Representative in such a way that
(A) Parent shall be responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value
of disputed items submitted to the Referral Firm that are resolved against
Parent (as finally determined by the Referral Firm) and the denominator of
which is the total dollar value of the disputed items so submitted and (B) the
Representative shall be responsible for the remaining amount of fees and
expenses. In the event of any dispute regarding such allocation, the Referral
Firm shall determine the allocation of its fees and expenses as between Parent
and the Representative in accordance with such allocation methodology, such
determination to be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Representative and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders.

 



 

(f) Promptly after their receipt of the Final Closing Date Statement, the
Representative and Parent shall compute the difference, if any, between the
Estimated Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration and the Final Merger Consideration. If the Estimated Merger
Consideration exceeds the Final Merger Consideration, then Parent shall be
entitled to receive, promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days,
from the Fully-Diluted Stockholders (in accordance with their Ownership
Percentages) an amount in cash equal to such excess amount to be paid solely
out of the Escrow Amount, plus interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per
annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment. PARENT AGREES THAT ITS
SOLE SOURCE OF RECOVERY UNDER THIS _SECTION 2.13_ SHALL BE LIMITED TO, AND
SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE, THE ESCROW AMOUNT. If the Estimated Merger
Consideration is less than the Final Merger Consideration, the Representative
shall be entitled to receive, promptly and in any event within five (5)
Business Days, from Parent an amount in cash equal to such deficiency, plus
interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum from the Closing Date to
the date of payment, which amount will be distributed by the Representative to
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in accordance with their Ownership Percentages.
In the event that, immediately following the payments of the amounts described
above, more than $20,000,000 remains in the Escrow Account, then Parent and
the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to, or at the direction of, the
Representative, an amount in cash equal to (i) the amount of funds remaining
in the Escrow Account _minus_ (ii) the sum of (a) $20,000,000 _plus_ (b) the
amount of any pending claims against the Escrow Account, which amount will be
distributed by the Representative to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders in
accordance with their Ownership Percentages.

 



 

(g) The parties agree that the Initial Closing Date Statement, the Closing
Date Statement and the Final Closing Date Statement will measure the Cash, the
Working Capital and the Closing Indebtedness (each of the foregoing as of
12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date), the Transaction Tax Benefits and
the Seller Transaction Expenses, all in accordance with the definitions
thereof.

 



 

2.14 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
deliverable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, such
amounts that Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under the Code, the Treasury Regulations issued
thereunder, or any provision of state, local, provincial or non-U.S. Law. If
Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, intends to deduct or withhold any amounts from any payment made in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence (other than as a result of any failure by the
Company to deliver the certificate set forth in _Section 2.2(b)(xi)_ and
other than with respect to the payment of the Per Option Merger Consideration
to any Optionholder), such Person shall (i) provide the Representative or
other recipient reasonable advance notice of its intent to withhold such
amounts and the basis for such withholding, (ii) provide a reasonable
opportunity for the Representative or such other recipient to provide forms or
other evidence that would mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or
withholding and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Representative, such other recipient and the advisors thereof, as
applicable, to mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. To
the extent that Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Escrow Agent withholds any such amounts with respect to any Person and remits
such withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been paid to or on
behalf of such Person.

Support Agreement, or the rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_.

 



 

4.5 _Investigation; Limitation on Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other Person acting on behalf of the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or assets, except as expressly set

the Letters of Transmittal and the Stockholder Support Agreement. Without
limiting the scope of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article
III_, and/or in the Letters of Transmittal and/or the Stockholder Support
Agreement, or the rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_, Parent
and Merger Sub further agree that no Stockholder will have or be subject to
any liability to Parent or any other Person resulting from the distribution or
use by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or any of
their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other representatives of
any such information, and any legal opinions, memoranda, summaries or any
other information, document or material made available to Parent or its
Affiliates or representatives in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or any other form otherwise provided in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Letters of Transmittal and the Stockholder Support Agreement.

 



 

(c) Except for the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set

Transmittal and the Stockholder Support Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that (i) they are relying on their own investigation and analysis
in entering into the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) they are
knowledgeable about the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate and (iii) they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
Merger as contemplated by this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and are able to bear the substantial economic risk of such
investment for an indefinite period of time.

 



 

(d) In connection with Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub have received from or on behalf of
the Company certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certain business plan information of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Parent
and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and that Parent and
Merger Sub shall have no claim against any Stockholder or any other Person
with respect thereto. Accordingly, the Company makes no representations or
warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts). The foregoing shall in
no way be construed to limit or impair (i) the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in _Article III_ or those made by the Stockholders
in the Letters of Transmittal and/or the Stockholder Support Agreement, (ii)
the rights to indemnification under _Article IX_ or (iii) Parents or its
Affiliates right to make claims against any Person for or in the nature of

4.6 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the executed commitment letter, dated as of January 30, 2014
between Merger Sub, Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated (as amended to the extent permitted hereunder, the " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, Bank of America, N.A. has agreed to lend the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Financing Commitment has
not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of
the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As
of the date hereof, there are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party relating to the Debt
Financing Commitment that could affect the availability of the Financing,
other than (i) the fee letter relating to fees with respect to the Debt
Financing Commitment (a complete copy of which has been provided to the
Company, with only fee amounts, pricing caps and certain economic terms
redacted, which redacted items do not include any conditions precedent related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing and do not otherwise
include any terms or provisions that could delay or restrict the availability
of the full amount of the Financing ) (the " _Fee Letter_ "), and (ii) as
expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof,
the Debt Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligations of each of Parent, Merger Sub and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers or other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). There are
no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of

 



      
 

 



 

the Financing (including any "flex" provisions), other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Fee Letter or expressly
contemplated thereby. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing, together with
available cash of Parent, will be sufficient for Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Estimated Merger Consideration and all related fees and
expenses. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that would result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) by Parent under the Debt Financing
Commitment, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to
Parents and Merger Subs obligations hereunder, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees, if any,
required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Parent and the Company agree that a breach of this representation and
warranty shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to the
Companys obligations under this Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach)
Parent is willing and able to consummate the Acquisition on the Closing Date.

 



 

4.7 _Solvency_. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and
Merger Subs obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
set forth in _Article VI_, immediately after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section 4.7_, " _Solvent_
" shall mean that, with respect to any Person and as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the " _present fair saleable value_ " of the
assets of such Person, will, as of such date, exceed the amount of all "
_liabilities of such Person, contingent or otherwise,_ " as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) the
present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person will, as of such
date, be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the liability of
such Person on its indebtedness as its indebtedness becomes absolute and
matured, (c) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital with which to conduct its business and (d) such Person will
not have incurred indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as it matures. For
purposes of the foregoing definition only, " _indebtedness_ " means a
liability in connection with another Persons (x) right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured or (y) right to any equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not
such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 



 

4.8 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, proceedings, orders or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
affecting Parent or Merger Sub, at law or in equity, or before or by any
federal, state, municipal or other governmental department, commission, board,
bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, which would materially
adversely affect Parents or Merger Subs performance under this Agreement,
the Related Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 



 

4.9 _Acquisition for Investment; Restricted Securities_. Parent is acquiring
the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation solely for Parents own
account, for investment purposes

 



       
 

 



 

only, and not with a view to, or with any present intention of, reselling or
otherwise distributing the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or
dividing its participation herein with others. Parent understands and
acknowledges that (a) none of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
has been registered or qualified under the Securities Act, or under any
securities laws of any state of the United States or other jurisdiction, in
reliance upon specific exemptions thereunder for transactions not involving
any public offering; (b) all of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
constitutes " _restricted securities_ " as defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act; (c) none of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation is
traded or tradable on any securities exchange or over-the-counter; and (d)
none of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation may be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of unless a registration statement under the
Securities Act with respect to such capital stock and qualification in
accordance with any applicable state securities laws becomes effective or
unless such registration and qualification is inapplicable, or an exemption
therefrom is available. Parent will not transfer or otherwise dispose any of
the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation acquired hereunder or any
interest therein in any manner that may cause any Fully-Diluted Stockholder to
be in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws.
Parent is an " _accredited investor_ " as defined in Rule 501(a) of the
Securities Act.

 



 

4.10 _Plant Closings and Mass Lay-Offs_. Parent does not currently plan or
contemplate any plant closings, reductions in force or terminations that, in
the aggregate, would constitute a mass lay-off of the employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under or any federal, state or local statute or
ordinance.

 



 

4.11 _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has used, paid, has
become obligated to pay, or will pay or become obligated to pay, any fee or
commission to any broker, investment banker, financial advisor or finder in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the
Company or any of its Stockholders could become liable or obligated.

employees of the Joint Venture Entities, available to Parent and Merger Sub
and their representatives as Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives
shall from time to time reasonably request, in each case of the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , to the extent that such access and disclosure
would not obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Joint
Venture Entities to take any actions that would unreasonably disrupt the
normal course of

 



      
 

 



 

their businesses; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company
to provide access or to disclose any information to Parent if such access or

would cause significant competitive harm to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Joint Venture Entities if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (B) would be in violation
of applicable Laws (including the HSR Act and other anti-trust laws) or (C)
would violate an obligation of confidentiality under a Contract with a third
party to which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Joint
Venture Entities is bound or adversely affect the ability to assert attorney-
client, attorney work product or other similar privilege, _provided_ that in
the cases of _subclauses (A)_ through _(B)_ above, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the consent of any Person
necessary to permit such disclosure or make appropriate alternate

consultant or other advisors, providing a summary of such information and/or
making such information available in a "clean room" or similar place where
access is restricted to Person permitted to view such information. Parent is
not authorized to and shall not (and shall cause its employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates to not) contact any customer, supplier,
distributor, lender or other material third party business relation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Companys business or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing without
the prior written consent of Thaddeus J. Fortin (it being understood that
nothing in this _Section 5.1(a)_ shall restrict the right of Parent or any
such Person from contacting (y) any such customer, supplier, distributor,
lender or other material third party business relation in the ordinary course
of conducting its own business or (z) any lender of the Company with respect
to such lenders potential participation in the Financing).

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives shall
treat and hold strictly confidential any Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality

and shall use the Companys commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint
Venture Entities to conduct its business in the ordinary and usual course of
business consistent with past practice. From the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is terminated, other
than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as set forth in _Section
5.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule or with the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Venture Entities not to,
directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions:

 



 

(a) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividends, distributions or other

information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist
or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any
Person to effect a Competing Transaction, or accept any proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to a potential
Competing Transaction. The Company shall, and shall cause all Persons acting
on behalf of it to immediately cease any existing activities, discussions and
negotiations with any Persons with respect to any of the foregoing.

 



 

5.4 _Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each party hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as practicable (a) obtain from
Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary or may be required
for or as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) make all necessary filings with respect to this
Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby required under applicable
Law. The " _commercially reasonable efforts_ " of the Company shall not
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their Affiliates or
representatives to expend any money to remedy any breach of any representation
or warranty hereunder, to obtain any consent required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or to provide financing to Parent for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that if the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their Affiliates or representatives elect
to remedy such breach, the Company shall not be deemed to be in breach of such
representation or warranty, or

 



      
 

 



 

in violation of any covenant pursuant to _Section 5.2_, for purposes of
determining Parents obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

 



 

5.5 _Competition Clearance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting _Section 5.4_, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within seven (7) Business Days of the date hereof
and to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional
information and documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all
other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable and to obtain all requisite authorizations and approvals under
other Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall request
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act unless both Parent
and the Company otherwise agree.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand,
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 5.5(a)_ to
obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ
or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Law_ " means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, Foreign Competition Laws and all other
federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Sections 5.5(a)_ and _(b)_ , if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law
or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all such actions as may be necessary to resolve

 



      
 

 



 

objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner, including (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, regardless of the consideration, the sale,
divestiture, license or disposition of any assets or businesses of the Company
or the Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates or of Parent or controlled
Affiliates, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that
after the Closing Date would limit Parents, the Companys or the
Subsidiaries or their controlled Affiliates freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its businesses, product lines or
assets, in each case as may be required in order to effect the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ and _Article VII_ prior to the
Termination Date and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other legal requirement in any
suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the Termination Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any order, requirement, condition, understanding or
agreement of or with a Governmental Authority to sell, to license, to hold
separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, unless such order, requirement, condition, understanding or
agreement is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written
consent of Parent, publicly or before any Governmental Authority or other
third party, offer, suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any sale,
disposition, license, prohibition, restriction, limitation or other action of
a type described in this _Section 5.5(c)_.

 



 

(d) Parent shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under the
HSR Act.

 



 

5.6 _Supplemental Information_. From time to time prior to the Closing, each
party hereto shall give prompt notice in writing to the other parties of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any matter which occurrence or failure (a)
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement would have been
required to be disclosed or (b) would render inaccurate, or result in a breach
of, any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of such
party contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not (i) be deemed to have
modified any representation or warranty or cured any breach for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in _Article
VI_ or _VII_ , as applicable, a partys right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VIII_ or a partys right to indemnification pursuant to
_Article IX_, (ii) limit in any way or otherwise affect the remedies
available to a party hereunder or (iii) constitute an acknowledgment or
admission of a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

5.7 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access and Cooperation; Litigation
Support_.

 



 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such other
period (if longer) required by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall
preserve and retain, all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human
resources, Tax and other books and records of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries (including any documents relating to any

 



      
 

 



 

governmental or non-governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations) relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Except as determined in good faith by Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(i) as is necessary to ensure compliance with applicable Law, (ii) the
preservation of attorney-client, attorney work product or other similar
privilege, or (iii) compliance with confidentiality obligations under
Contracts with third parties, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall,
after the Closing Date, afford promptly to the Representative reasonable
access during normal business hours to the books and records of the Surviving
Corporation upon the reasonable written request by the Representative,
including on behalf of any Fully-Diluted Stockholder, for a reasonable
business purpose pertaining to a Fully-Diluted Stockholders prior ownership
and solely to the extent that such access will not unreasonably interfere with
the normal conduct of Parents or the Surviving Corporations business;
provided, however, that in the case of a determination by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation referred to in _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ above,
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the consent of any Person necessary to permit
such disclosure or make appropriate alternate arrangements, (B) limit such
access or information only to the extent the provision of such access or
information is restricted or harmful and (C) reasonably cooperate with the
Representative to eliminate or limit such restriction and allow such access or
information to the maximum extent possible, including by providing such access
or information to the Representatives attorney, accountants, consultant or
other advisors, providing a summary of such information and/or making such
information available in a "clean room" or similar place where access is
restricted to Person permitted to view such information..

 



 

5.8 _Employees and Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Parent has no present intention to terminate the employment of or
materially change the terms and conditions of employment of any persons who
are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(the " _Employees_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent agree
to reasonably cooperate with (which shall include providing Parent a
meaningful opportunity to review and comment on all material documents and
communications) and to provide information to each other, in each case as
necessary or appropriate to comply with or satisfy any requirement or custom
to consult with or provide information to, with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any employee or labor
organization representing or related to employees of any of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) For a period of no less than one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause the Employees to
be provided with (i) a base salary or wages that are no less favorable than,
(ii) variable/incentive/bonus pay programs that provide the same or better
target bonus opportunities (excluding any value attributable to equity and
equity-based compensation) as compared to, and (iii) other benefit plans and
arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than, in each of
_clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , those provided to such Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 5.8_ shall not limit the obligation of any of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates to comply with applicable Laws or
the terms of any existing compensation

 



      
 

 



 

arrangement or benefit plan (as such arrangement or benefit plan may be
modified, amended or terminated in accordance with its terms). No provision of
this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of
any Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit
Parent and the Surviving Corporation from having the right to terminate the
employment of any Employee; _provided_ that any such termination is effected
in accordance with applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan.

 



 

(c) Each Employee and former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates (and any predecessor
entities thereof, to the extent such predecessor service is credited under the
applicable plan by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing)
before the Closing Date under any employee benefit plan of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates providing benefits similar to
those provided under a Benefit Plan (including under any applicable pension,
401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave
or other leave entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance,
termination indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) to the same extent
as such employee or former employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to
credit for such service under such Benefit Plan for purposes of eligibility to
participate, level of vacation or severance benefits, vesting and benefit
accrual (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan),
except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits
for the same period of service. With respect to the calendar year in which
Parent or any of its Affiliates ceases to maintain any particular Benefit Plan
(or to the extent an employee ceases to participate in a Benefit Plan in
connection with or following the Closing Date), each employee shall be given
credit for amounts paid under such Benefit Plan for the applicable plan year
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
(including any lifetime maximums) as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Parent or its Affiliate, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Parent shall waive for each Employee and his or her dependents any waiting
period provision, payment requirement to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing
condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement and any other restriction
that would prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates applicable to
such Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have
been applicable to such Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) On and after Closing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any and all notices, liabilities, costs,
payments and expenses arising from any action by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (including breach of contract,
defamation or retaliatory discharge) regarding Employees who are employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, including any
such liability (i) under any applicable law that relates to employees,
employee benefit matters or labor matters, (ii) for dismissal, wrongful
termination or constructive dismissal or termination, or severance pay or
other termination pay, or (iii) under or with respect to any benefit plan,
program, contract, policy, commitment, or arrangement of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

severance or retention plans to the extent such severance or retention plans
provide payments or benefits with respect to any Employee; _provided_ , that
this _Section 5.8(e)_ shall not limit any other right or remedy of Parent
under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) At the written request of Parent provided to the Representative not less
than ten (10) days prior to the Closing, the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary shall adopt a resolution terminating the Haas Group International
Inc. 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_") effective as of or immediately prior
to the Closing Date, contingent upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Employees who, while employed by the Surviving
Corporation after Closing, receive an eligible rollover distribution (within
the meaning of Section 402(f)(2) of the Code) that constitutes a direct
rollover distribution within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and
regulations thereunder from the 401(k) Plan shall, subject to the provisions
of Section 402 of the Code, be permitted to make a rollover contribution to a
plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code that is maintained by Parent
or one of its Affiliates. Parent shall take all action necessary to ensure
that any Employee who has an outstanding loan under the 401(k) Plan at the
Closing Date and elects a direct rollover in accordance with the preceding
sentence will be permitted to continue to repay such loan under the 401(k)
plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliate.

 



 

(g) In any termination or layoff of any Employee by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation on or after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
comply fully, if applicable, with the WARN Act and all other applicable
foreign, federal, state and local laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and requiring notice to employees. Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to not, at any time prior
to sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, effectuate a " _plant closing_ " or
" _mass layoff_ " as those terms are defined in the WARN Act affecting in
whole or in part any facility, site of employment, operating unit or employee
of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries without complying fully with
the requirements of the WARN Act. With respect to any acts or omissions by
Parent or Surviving Corporation on or after the Closing, Parent and Surviving
Corporation will bear the cost of compliance with (or failure to comply with)
any such laws.

 



 

5.9 _Public Announcements_. Prior to or following the Closing, the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Representative shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to, issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statements or disclosures with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the terms hereof, without the prior consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except that no consent shall be necessary to the extent such statements or
disclosures are required by applicable Law or by the rules of any national
securities exchange (in which case such party agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other parties prior to
issuing or causing the publication of such press release or other public
announcement). The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Representative will
consult with each other in good faith before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements or disclosures with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the terms hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Related
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, The Jordan Company, L.P. and its
Affiliates may provide (a) the financial results achieved by The Jordan
Company, L.P. and its Affiliates with respect to their beneficial interest in
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (b) a general description of the

 



       
 

 



 

Company and its Subsidiaries (including their financial performance, and The
Jordan Company, L.P.s and its Affiliates investment and role therein), to
the current or prospective limited partners or other business affiliates of
The Jordan Company, L.P. or such Affiliates and their respective advisors.

 



 

5.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation agree to indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present officers and directors of the Company and of its Subsidiaries to the
same extent such Persons are currently indemnified by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys or its Subsidiarys Constituent
Documents for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date, and
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Surviving
Corporations or any of its Subsidiaries Constituent Documents relating to
the exculpation or indemnification of former officers and directors in a
manner less favorable than such provisions in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except as may be, and only to the extent, required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 5.10_ and
not in limitation thereof (and without in any way limiting or modifying the
obligations of any insurance carrier contemplated by this _Section 5.10_),
for six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO
Indemnifying Party_"), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), the individuals who, on or
prior the Closing Date, were officers or directors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_" and collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnitees_") against all DandO Expenses (as defined below), losses, claims,
damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Costs_") in respect
of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising
out of or relating to (i) the fact that such Person is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) arising out of acts
or omissions taken by the DandO Indemnitees in such capacity occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date (including in respect of acts or omissions in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby) (in
each case, a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_"), except for acts or omissions
constituting fraud or which involve conduct known to such Person at the time
to constitute a material violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such indemnification of a DandO Indemnitee shall not be available with
respect to any amount that the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
recover from a DandO Indemnitee under _Article IX_ of this Agreement or
pursuant to the Stockholder Support Agreement or any Letter of Transmittal.
Each DandO Indemnitee shall be entitled to advances of all DandO Expenses incurred
in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances
where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such claim)
promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor; _provided_
, that any DandO Indemnitee to whom DandO Expenses are advanced undertakes to
repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that such DandO
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claims
made on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, shall
continue in effect until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all
judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO
Indemnifiable Claim are fully

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section 5.10(b)_, " _D andO Expenses_"
shall include reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs,
charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to defend, to be a witness in or participate in any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses, judgments and amounts paid in
settlement (which items are included in the definition of DandO Costs).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely. In
the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors and
assigns of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall expressly
assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.10_
applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnitee.

 



 

5.11 _Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
timely manner, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof and on or before the Closing Date with
respect to any Tax. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared, and any positions
and elections relating thereto made, in a manner consistent with the prior
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file
or cause to be prepared and filed in a timely manner, all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared, and any positions and elections relating
thereto made, in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company
and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable Laws. The
Surviving Corporation shall permit the Representative to comment on any Tax
Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period at least
thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as is reasonable taking into account
the Tax period of the respective Tax Return and other relevant circumstances)
prior to filing, and shall make any reasonable revisions to such Tax Returns
as are requested by the Representative to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and to the extent such revisions relate to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws or otherwise permitted by
this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), file any amended Tax Return with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that would result in a breach of any of the Companys representations
or warranties contained herein, or otherwise give rise to a claim for
indemnification under _Section 9.2_ or any obligations of the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders. Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby covenant and agree
that neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall, unless required by applicable Laws or otherwise permitted
by this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (i) retroactively apply any
changes, amendments or alterations in the Tax positions or elections, or
method of Tax accounting taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
any manner or (ii) enter into or commence negotiations regarding any closing,
settlement, or other agreement with any Governmental Authority relating to
Taxes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period that, in each such case, would result in a
breach of any of the Companys representations or warranties contained herein
or otherwise give rise to a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ or
any obligations of the Fully-Diluted Stockholders.

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall elect (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to elect) to treat all applicable taxable periods
as ending on the Closing Date; provided that if the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the
portion of any Taxes that are payable for such Straddle Period and relate or
are attributable or allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of ad valorem or property Taxes, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable as computed on a
closing of the books basis as if the relevant Tax period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts, if
any, included in the income of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a United
States shareholder (within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code) under
Section 951 of the Code with respect to the Straddle Period of any controlled
foreign corporation (within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code) shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods of the Company or such
Subsidiary by assuming that, for purposes of Section 951 of the Code, the
Straddle Period of the controlled foreign corporation consisted of two taxable
years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the
other of which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt
by such party of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments
or other actions or proceedings relating to Taxes for which the other party
may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise have
liability (" _Tax Contest Claim_ "); provided, however, that no failure or
delay by any party to provide notice of a Tax Contest Claim shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations of the indemnitor hereunder, except to the
extent the defense of such Tax Contest Claim is adversely affected thereby.
Parent and the Representative shall cooperate with each other in the conduct
of any Tax Contest Claim. The Representative shall have the right to elect to
control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim that relates solely to Taxes with
respect to a taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date for which
the Parent Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under
_Article IX_ (a " _Seller Tax Contest Claim_ "); _provided_ , that (i) the
Representative shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the progress
and substantive aspects of such Seller Tax Contest Claim (including providing
copies of all written correspondence), (ii) Parent shall be entitled to
participate in such Seller Tax Contest Claim, at its sole expense, and (iii)
the Representative shall not compromise or settle any such Seller Tax Contest
Claim without obtaining Parents prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have the right to control
any Seller Tax Contest Claim if the reasonably expected liability for Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeds two times the

 



      
 

 



 

amount for which the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to receive
pursuant to Article IX after taking into account the reasonably expected
liability for other claims under Article IX. Parent shall have the right to
control all Tax Contest Claims (other than any Seller Tax Contest Claim the
Representative is entitled to control pursuant to this Section 5.11(c));
provided that with respect to any such Tax Contest Claim for which the Parent
Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification under _Article IX_,
(i) Parent shall keep the Representative reasonably informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim (including
providing copies of all written correspondence), (ii) the Representative shall
be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest Claim, at its sole expense,
with respect to issues in such Tax Contest Claim for which Parent is entitled
to indemnification under _Article IX_ and (iii) Parent shall not compromise
or settle any such issues in such Tax Contest Claim that could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Fully Diluted Stockholders
without obtaining the Representatives prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent there is any
conflict between the provisions of this _Section 5.11(c)_ and _Article IX_,
the provisions of this _Section 5.11(c)_ shall control.

 



 

(d) Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders
and the Representative shall cooperate fully, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably required by the
other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Section 5.11_ and any administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention of, and upon the other
partys request, the provision of records and information reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return or proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material providing hereunder, and the provision of such powers or attorney
as may be necessary to allow for the control of any administrative or judicial
proceedings with respect to Taxes. Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
the Representative and their Affiliates, upon the reasonable request of the
other party, shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) The parties agree, for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes,
to treat and report the consideration received by the Stockholders in respect
of Preferred Stock as full payment in exchange for such stock, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



 

5.12 _Transactions Outside the Ordinary Course of Business_.

 



 

(a) Any Taxes incurred as a result of any actions or transactions on the
Closing Date, but after the Closing, taken by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or their Affiliates that are not in the ordinary course of
business and not contemplated by this Agreement shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Laws, be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and for
purposes of filing all relevant Tax Returns as occurring on the day after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Subsidiary of the Company that is characterized as a
foreign corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (a " _Foreign
Corporate Subsidiary_ "), from the Closing Date through the end of the taxable
period of such entity that includes the Closing Date,

 



      
 

 



 

neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall take, or cause its
Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries of the Company) to take any action or
enter into any transaction that would be considered under the Code to
constitute the payment of an actual or deemed dividend by such Foreign
Corporate Subsidiary, including pursuant to Section 304 of the Code, which
dividend would result in a diminution of foreign tax credits that, absent such
transaction, may be claimed in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without obtaining the
Representatives prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) Parent shall not make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with
respect to the acquisition of the Company or the Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.13 _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local and non-U.S. transfer,
excise, sales, use, value added, registration, stamp, recording, property and
similar Taxes or fees (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
described in _Section 2.14_) applicable to, imposed upon, or arising out of
the transfer of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants shall be
paid by Parent.

 



 

5.14 _Stockholders Action_.

 



 

(a) Within one (1) Business Day following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent the Stockholder Support Agreement executed by
holders of 90% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and the Preferred
Stock, which agreement shall include resolutions adopted by written consent of
the holders of 90% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and the
holders of 90% of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock evidencing the
adoption and approval by such holders of the Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with the DGCL
and the Companys Constituent Documents.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and deliver to any Fully-Diluted Stockholder who has not executed the
Stockholder Support Agreement a notice that complies with Section 228(e) of
the DGCL of the adoption and the approval of this Agreement, the Stockholder
Support Agreement and the other Related Agreements to which the Company is
party, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
by written consent of the Companys stockholders, which notice shall also
constitute the notice required under applicable Laws that appraisal or similar
rights may be available to the Stockholders who did not execute the
Stockholder Support Agreement, under certain circumstances. Any materials to
be submitted to the Stockholders by the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to Parents
advance review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(c) If required to avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the
Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary payment or benefit
waivers and shall deliver to its stockholders a disclosure statement intended
to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code, soliciting the consent of its stockholders to the transactions
disclosed therein. Parent shall provide the Representative with all relevant
terms of any employment contracts or other arrangements that

 



      
 

 



 

will be entered with the "disqualified individuals" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or before the
Closing Date that could result in payments and other terms (including, rights
to severances or signing bonuses) that need to be approved (or disclosed) to
ensure the disclosure and consent under the previous sentence is valid. To the
extent such information provided by Parent is incorrect or incomplete in any
respect, all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be computed for purposes of this
Agreement assuming that no payment made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any payments included in the Transaction Tax Benefits)
is nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code, but only to the extent that
the incorrect or incomplete information provided by Parent is the sole cause
for a payment being nondeductible under Section 280G.

 



 

5.15 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Without the prior written consent of the Company, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing
Commitment if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement would or
would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (ii)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto. Subject to the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment
and this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things within their control that are necessary to arrange the
Financing on substantially the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitment (provided that Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt
Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment
as of the date hereof), including using its reasonable best efforts to (w)
maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment, (x) satisfy all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing at the Closing
set forth therein that are within its control, (y) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitment or, subject to the previous sentence, on such
other terms acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources
(and provide copies thereof to the Company) and (z) upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Debt Financing Commitment and such amounts are required to pay the Estimated
Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable to
Parent and Merger Sub and in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion of the Financing. Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing
Sources providing the Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date if all conditions set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in the Debt Financing Commitment have been satisfied or waived (other
than the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions. For purposes of
this _Section 5.15_ and _Section 4.5_, references to " _Financing_ " shall
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as
permitted by this _Section 5.15_ to be amended, modified or replaced and
references to " _Debt Financing Commitment_ " shall include such documents as
permitted by this _Section 5.15_ to be amended, modified or replaced, in each
case from and after such amendment, modification or replacement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with
Parent (and use reasonable best efforts to cause the independent accounting
firm and other advisers retained by the Company to cooperate with Parent) in
connection with the Financing contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment,
including, without limitation, (i) facilitating customary due diligence, (ii)
arranging for members of senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions
(or other sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies),
drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies or other syndication
activities reasonably required in order to satisfy the conditions to
consummation of the Financing, (iii) assisting Parent and the Financing
Sources with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda (including customary authorization
and representation letters) and other written offering materials used to
syndicate such Financing, to the extent information contained therein relates
to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iv)(A) assisting with the preparation of
any pledge and security documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest
hedging agreement, and other definitive financing documents and using
reasonable best efforts to assist in the negotiation and execution of
collateral related documentation involving third parties and (B) providing
documents requested by Parent or the Financing Sources relating to the
existing indebtedness of the Company and the release of related Liens,
including customary payoff letters, (v) facilitating the pledging of
collateral and the granting of security interests in collateral in connection
with the Financing, _provided_ that no pledge or grant of security interests
shall be effective until the Closing, and (vi) furnishing to Parent and its
Financing Sources as promptly as practicable such financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to satisfy the conditions to consummation of
the Financing, including, without limitation, applicable "know your customer"
information and the Required Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or similar fees in
connection with the Financing and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to enter into any binding commitment or incur any liability in
connection with the Financing which is not contingent upon the Closing or that
would be effective prior to Closing. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders, their
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section 5.15(b)_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith, other than to the extent any of the foregoing arise from
(A) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any of the Company, the
Subsidiaries or its or their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives or (B) any
information provided by any of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors which is

 



      
 

 



 

the subject of any of the representations or warranties set forth in _Article
III_ and such information would constitute a breach of any such representation
or warranty. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable out of pocket costs incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation
required by this _Section 5.15(b)_. The Company consents to the reasonable
use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing in a manner customary for financing transactions,
and no fees or commissions in connection with the Financing shall constitute
Seller Transaction Expenses.

 



 

5.16 _Consideration Allocation Spreadsheet_.

 



 

(a) No later than two (2) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory

(ii) the Preferred Stock Redemption Amount (as well as the aggregate Series A

price per share of such Warrants.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders understands that
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on such certificate for
the purposes of making any payments hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

5.17 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Non-Assertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

employee of any of the foregoing (individually and collectively, the " _Seller

transactions contemplated hereby, by any legal counsel currently representing
the Seller Group in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Current Representation_ ").

 



 

(b) Parent waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause the Surviving

and any member of the Seller Group occurring during the Current Representation

with a dispute with Parent and, following the Closing, with the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that all rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such
attorney-client privilege shall be retained by the Company; _provided_ that
the foregoing waiver and acknowledgment of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby, or to communications with any Person other
than the Seller Group.

 



 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to discuss and
obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of,
and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel.

 



 

5.18 _FineChem Dividends_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not
exercise an approval or other similar right to prevent, or otherwise take

(b) By either the Company or Parent if the Closing of the Merger shall not
have occurred on or before March 30, 2014 (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Termination Date shall automatically be

have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement as of the date

this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or directly resulted in, the
failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of either party hereunder.

 



 

8.2 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses. As used in this

termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in
_Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party,
specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made
and the basis therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement will
forthwith become void and have no further force or effect, without any
Liability (other than as set forth in _Section 8.2_, this _Section 8.3_ and
_Section 8.4_) on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of _Section
8.2_, this _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_, _Sections 5.1(b)_ , _9.4_ , _10.6_
, _10.7_ , _10.9_ , _10.12_ and _10.13_ will survive any termination hereof;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that subject to the terms of this
_Section 8.3_ and _Section 8.4_, nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall
relieve any party of any Liability for any material breach by such party of
any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement or for fraud.

 



 

8.4 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, then Parent shall pay the Company an amount in
cash equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") as set forth in this
_Section 8.4_. Parent shall pay the Termination Fee to the Company, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company, within two (2) Business Days after the date of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_.

 



 

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Termination Fee
shall constitute liquidated damages, and not a penalty, that the Company would
not have entered into this Agreement without the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.4_ and that the payment of the Termination Fee in the
circumstances specified herein is supported by due and sufficient
consideration. If Parent fails to pay the Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 8.4(a)_, Parent shall pay to the Company, together with the
Termination Fee, (a) interest on the Termination Fee from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate equal to five percent (5%) per annum
and (b) if, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences an action
or proceeding against Parent for the Termination Fee, any reasonable and
documented legal fees and costs incurred by the Company in connection with any
such action or proceeding.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than the
Companys right to seek specific performance pursuant to _Section 8.5_, the
Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ or
_Section 8.1(g)_ and receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.4(a)_ and any amounts under _Section 8.4(b)_ shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether in respect of any other document or theory of law or
equity, in contract in tort or otherwise) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and the Representative and any of their respective former,
current or future direct or indirect stockholders, controlling persons,
general or limited partners, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, assignees, representatives or Affiliates or any former,
current, or future direct or indirect stockholder, controlling person, general
or limited partner, member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent,
assignee, representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively
the " _Company Related Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing
Sources, any other potential debt financing source or any of their respective
former, current or future direct or indirect stockholders, controlling
persons, general or limited partners, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, assignees, representatives or

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates or any former, current or future direct or indirect stockholder,
controlling person, general or limited partner, member, manager, director,
officer, employee, agent, assignee, representative or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing (collectively the " _Parent Related Parties_ " and, with respect to
the Financing Sources, such Persons collectively, the " _Financing Parties_ ")
for all Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or in respect of this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Debt
Financing Commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful and intentional,
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement except with respect to
any obligations that survive such termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.3_) or in connection with any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection therewith or in respect of any other document
or theory of law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and, upon
receipt of the Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 8.4_,
including any further amounts due under _Section 8.4(b)_, none of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to any of the
Company Related Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Related Agreements, the Debt Financing Commitment, or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including in respect of any breach, whether
or not willful and intentional, of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement) or in connection with any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection therewith or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Company
Related Parties shall seek to recover any other monetary damages or seek any
other remedy based on a claim at law or in equity with respect thereto, except
with respect to any obligations that survive such termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

 



 

(d) While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief under _Section 8.5_, followed by, if available in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 8.4_, the payment of the Termination Fee
under this _Section 8.4_, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance or other
equitable relief (excluding interlocutory relief) and the Termination Fee in
connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

8.5 _Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages
alone. Subject to _Sections 8.4(c)_ and _8.4(d)_ , except as otherwise set
forth in this _Section 8.5_, the parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 8.5_. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

 



      
 

 



 

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.5_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 8.5_, the
parties hereto agree that the Company shall not be entitled to seek specific
performance to cause Parent to consummate the Closing of the transaction.

 



 

(c) To the extent any party hereto brings any action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3_ hereof) when
expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time
during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

SURVIVAL AND REMEDY; INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

9.1 _Survival_. All of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, together
with the warranties, representations, agreements and covenants contained
herein or in any instrument or document delivered or to be delivered pursuant
to this Agreement, shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the representations and
warranties of the Company in _Section 3.11_ (other than the representations
and warranties in _Sections 3.11(g)_ , _(h)_ and _(l)_ ) will not survive
Closing, (b) all other representations and warranties of the Company
(including the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.11(g)_ , _(h)_
and _(l)_ ), Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement and in any certificate
delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing
and continue for a period of twelve(12) months after the Closing Date, (c) all
covenants and agreements of the parties in this Agreement to be performed or
complied with prior to Closing shall survive the Closing for a period of
twelve (12) months and (d) all covenants and agreements of the parties in this
Agreement which, by their terms, are to be performed or complied with at or
following the Closing shall survive in accordance with their terms. The
parties hereto agree that if notice of an indemnification claim in accordance
with _Section 9.5_ or _Section 9.6_ is given on or prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period indicated in the foregoing sentence (each,
an " _Indemnification Period_ "), then, notwithstanding that such
Indemnification Period shall have expired, the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and obligations relating to such claim shall continue to
survive until the claim is finally resolved. Thereafter, neither the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Company nor the Fully Diluted Stockholders shall be
under any obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or any certificate in respect
thereto. It is acknowledged that the representations, warranties and covenants
made by the Company are made as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing on behalf of the Company, and are not made by the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

9.2 _Indemnification from the Escrow Amount_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Article IX_ (including _Sections
9.4_ and _9.7_ ), from and after the Closing, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Affiliates, and

 



      
 

 



 

their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, representatives
and agents (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall have the right assert
a claim against the Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement, including the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Sections 9.4_ and _9.7_ , for any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any
of the Parent Indemnified Parties arising out of any of the following:

 



 

(i) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
the Company pursuant to _Article III_ of this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith or therewith;

 



 

(ii) any breach of or failure by the Company to perform any agreement,
covenant or obligation of the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered or to be delivered in connection herewith or therewith;

 



 

(iii) any appraisal remedies under the DGCL in respect of any Dissenting
Shares pursuant to _Section 2.8_ of this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) any inaccuracy in the payment amounts or instructions provided in the
Consideration Allocation Certificate; and

 



 

(v) any Taxes attributable or allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (for this
purpose, determined without regard to any Transactions Tax Deductions);
provided, that for purposes of this clause (v), references to "Taxes" (x)
shall be deemed to include amounts that would have constituted "Taxes" but for
the set-off or other utilization of any loss, deduction, credit or other Tax
benefit or asset generated in or with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period and
(y) shall not include (I) any such Taxes to the extent such Taxes were
reflected in Final Closing Indebtedness or Final Working Capital or (II) any
such Taxes resulting from a breach by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
under _Section 5.11(a)_.

 



 

(b) On the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing, the Escrow
Agent shall release the balance of the Escrow Amount to the Fully Diluted
Stockholders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Ownership
Percentages and otherwise in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; provided,
that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the then-remaining balance
of the Escrow Amount) equal to the aggregate amount of claims for
indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ asserted prior to such date ("
_Unresolved Indemnity Claims_ "). The portion of the Escrow Amount retained
for any such Unresolved Indemnity Claims shall be subsequently released by the
Escrow Agent following the resolution of all such Unresolved Indemnity Claims
in accordance with this _Article IX_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent with respect to each release of
funds described in this _Section 9.2(b)_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the right of
any party to indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ or other remedy
based on any representations, warranties, covenants and obligations will not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before

 



      
 

 



 

or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification or other remedies based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, references in this _Article IX_ to
"indemnitor" when a Parent Indemnified Party is an indemnitee shall be deemed
to be references to the Fully-Diluted Stockholders collectively, and any
notice requirement with respect to any notice required to be provided under
this _Article IX_ by an indemnitee to the indemnitor when a Parent
Indemnified Party is the indemnitee shall be deemed satisfied if such notice
is delivered to the Representative.

 



 

9.3 _Indemnification by Parent_. From and after the Closing, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation agree to indemnify the Fully-Diluted
Stockholders and their Affiliates, and each of their respective officers,
directors, partners, trustees, employees, stockholders, representatives and
agents, against, and agrees to hold them harmless from, any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by the Fully-Diluted Stockholders or any of the foregoing
Persons (or any combination thereof) (the " _Stockholder Indemnified Parties_
") arising out of (a) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to _Article IV_ of this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered or to be delivered in connection
herewith or therewith and (b) any breach of or failure by Parent or Merger Sub
to perform any agreement, covenant or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub set
out in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered or to be delivered in
connection herewith or therewith. In no event will the aggregate liability of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation for Losses arising under
claims of indemnification brought by the Stockholder Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ exceed $25,000,000; _provided_ , that this
limitation shall not apply to Parents obligations under _Article II_ or
_Article VIII._

 



 

9.4 _Indemnification Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except in
the case of fraud, subject to _Section 9.6_, the sole recourse and exclusive
remedy of the parties to this Agreement for the breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall be
to assert a claim for indemnification under the indemnification provisions of
_Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ (as applicable); _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Article IX_ shall limit any partys right to seek specific performance or
other equitable relief pursuant to _Section 8.5_. Except for claims pursuant
to this _Article IX_, each indemnified party hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims, and causes of action it may have against any indemnifying
party arising under this Agreement or any certificate delivered or to be
delivered in connection herewith based upon predecessor or successor
liability, contribution, tort or strict liability or any federal, state, local
or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation or ordinance or otherwise. No Person
who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, general or
limited partner, direct or indirect stockholder or equityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this Agreement or any
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
manager, general or limited partner, direct or indirect stockholder or
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative

 



      
 

 



 

of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), nor any
Financing Party shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of
an entity party against its owners or affiliates, or otherwise) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or the negotiation or execution hereof or thereof; and each party
hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations
against any such Non-Party Affiliates and any such Financing Parties. Non-
Party Affiliates and Financing Parties are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

 



 

9.5 _Third-Party Claims_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
following procedures shall be applicable with respect to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_ relating to or arising out of claims or actions
by Governmental Authorities or other third parties. Promptly after receipt by
the party seeking indemnification hereunder (hereinafter the " _indemnitee_ ")
of notice of the commencement of any action or the assertion of any claim,
liability or obligation by a Governmental Authority or a third party (whether
by legal process or otherwise), against which claim, liability or obligation a
party under this _Article IX_ (hereinafter the " _indemnitor_ ") that is, or
may be, required under this Agreement to indemnify such indemnitee, the
indemnitee will, if a claim thereon is to be, or may be, made against the
indemnitor pursuant to this _Article IX_, promptly notify the indemnitor in
writing of the commencement or assertion thereof, including the reasonable
details with respect to the factual and legal basis for such claim; _provided_
, that the failure of any indemnitee to give prompt notice hereunder shall not
affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the
indemnitor demonstrates actual material prejudice caused by such failure. The
indemnitor shall have, in all instances, the right to participate in the
defense of such action with counsel of reputable standing. The indemnitor
shall have the right to assume the defense of such action, unless such action
(a) may result in orders or mandatory injunctions materially impacting the
indemnitees on-going operation of the business, (b) may result in liabilities
which, taken with other then-existing claims under this _Article IX_, would
not be fully indemnified hereunder or (c) may result in potential criminal
liability. The indemnitor shall have twenty (20) days, after receipt of notice
of such claim, process, legal proceeding and other written notice, to assume
the defense thereof. If the indemnitor does assume such defense, it will,
within such twenty (20) days, so notify the indemnitee. If the indemnitor does
not assume such defense and so notifies the indemnitee, or if the indemnitor
is barred from assuming such defense pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, then the
indemnitee shall have the right to assume such defense, subject to the
participation of the indemnitor, as provided in this _Section 9.5_, and the
indemnitees fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with such defense will be borne by the indemnitor. In
any case, the indemnitor and indemnitee shall cooperate and assist each other
in such defense, and shall make available to the other all records, documents,
employees and information (written or otherwise) relevant to such defense. If
the indemnitee shall be required by judgment or a settlement agreement to pay
any amount or perform any action in respect of any obligation or liability
pursuant to which the indemnitee may make a claim against the Escrow Amount,
the indemnitee shall make a claim with the Escrow Agent for the Losses
incurred in performing such action (which shall include all reasonable legal
fees and expenses related thereto) to be withdrawn from the Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement, subject to
this _Article IX_. Prior to paying any claims against which an indemnitor is,
or may be, obligated under this Agreement to indemnify an

 



      
 

 



 

indemnitee pursuant to a settlement agreement (or judgment), the indemnitee
must supply the indemnitor with a copy of the proposed settlement (or court
judgment or decree, holding the indemnitee liable on such claim or failing
such judgment or decree) and must receive the written approval of the terms
and conditions of such settlement from the indemnitor (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ ,
indemnitors consent shall not be required for settlements (A) which consist
principally of equitable remedies in respect of the indemnitee or its
business, or (B) that result in payments by the indemnitee which, taken with
other then existing claims under this _Article IX_, would not be subject to
indemnification hereunder. An indemnitor or indemnitee shall have the
authority to settle or compromise any claim for which it has assumed or
conducted the defense pursuant to this _Section 9.5_; provided that an
indemnitor shall not settle or compromise any such claim if such settlement or
compromise (i) would result in an order, injunction or other equitable remedy
in respect of the indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (ii) would otherwise
have a direct effect upon the business or continuing operations of the
indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (iii) contains any admission or statement
suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the indemnitee or any of
its Affiliates, (iv) would result in any liabilities or Losses which, taken
together with other existing claims under this _Article IX_, would not be
fully indemnified by the indemnitor hereunder, or (v) would result in
potential criminal liability; in each case, without the prior written consent
of the indemnitee. An indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own
counsel in any case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the indemnitee, unless (x) the employment of such counsel shall
have been authorized in writing by the indemnitor in connection with the
defense of such action or claim, (y) the indemnitor shall not have assumed the
defense, or shall be barred from assuming the defense, of such action or claim
pursuant to this _Section 9.5_, or (z) such indemnitee shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be defenses available to it which are contrary to, or
inconsistent with, those available to the indemnitor, in any of which events
such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnitee shall be borne
by the indemnitor and paid in accordance with _Section 9.6_ and _Section
9.8_. If the parties are unable to agree on the amount of any partys
indemnification obligation pursuant to this _Section 9.5_ (or otherwise have
disputes pursuant to this _Section 9.5_), then such dispute shall be
submitted to arbitration conducted pursuant to the rules and procedures of the
American Arbitration Association (and the last three sentences of _Section
9.6_ shall apply to such arbitration proceeding).

 



 

9.6 _Procedure for Other Claims_. In the event that any indemnitee believes
that it is entitled to claim indemnification from an indemnitor under this
_Article IX_ and such claim is not subject to _Section 9.5_, the indemnitee
shall notify the indemnitor of such claim, the amount or estimated amount
thereof and the reasonable details with respect to the factual and legal basis
for such claim; _provided_ , that the failure of any indemnitee to give notice
hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent that the indemnitor demonstrates actual material prejudice caused by
such failure. The indemnitor and indemnitee will proceed, in good faith, to
agree on the amount of such indemnification claim. If the indemnitor and the
indemnitee agree on the amount of such indemnification claim, such amount will
be paid by the indemnitor or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, in
accordance with _Section 9.8_. If they are unable to agree on the amount of
such indemnification claim within thirty (30) days after such notice, then the
indemnification claim will be submitted to arbitration conducted pursuant to
the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The place of
such arbitration shall be New York, NY. The determination of the amount of any
indemnification claim pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to this _Section 9.6_ will be final, binding and conclusive, and the
indemnitee, upon final determination of the amount of the indemnification
claim, will be paid by the indemnitor or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be,
in accordance with _Section 9.8_, the full amount, in cash, of such
indemnification claim, as finally determined, and will be entitled to apply to
any court or authority of competent jurisdiction described in _Section 10.12_
to enforce such payment. Any arbitration costs, costs of any enforcement
proceeding and reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such arbitration
or enforcement proceeding, including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees, incurred by the indemnitor and indemnitee shall be borne by the
indemnitor and indemnitee in inverse proportion to their relative success in
such proceeding.

 



 

9.7 _Indemnification Limits_.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to any claims for indemnification relating to breaches
of any of the Fundamental Representations or any of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.11_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_
until such time as its respective aggregate right to such indemnification
exceeds $5,500,000 (it being agreed that in the event such threshold is
reached and exceeded, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders will only be liable for
Losses in excess of such amount), and only to the extent that the amount of
each individual claim for Losses (or series of related claims, in the
aggregate) exceeds $150,000. For the purposes of calculating the amount of the
Losses with respect to _Section 9.2(a)_, the representations and warranties
of the Company shall be deemed to exclude any materiality (including the words
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect") or similar qualifiers or exceptions
contained therein.

 



 

(b) EACH OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB AGREES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, ITS AFFILIATES
(INCLUDING THE SURVIVING CORPORATION), SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, STOCKHOLDERS, REPRESENTATIVES AND
AGENTS, THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF RECOVERY FOR ANY SUCH PERSONS
INDEMNIFICATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
SHALL BE LIMITED TO AND SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE ESCROW AMOUNT
EXCEPT FOR (I) CLAIMS AGAINST ANY STOCKHOLDER, ON A SEVERAL (AND NOT JOINT OR
JOINT AND SEVERAL) BASIS, PURSUANT TO THE STOCKHOLDER SUPPORT AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER RELATED AGREEMENT AS SET FORTH THEREIN AND (II) FRAUD. FOR AVOIDANCE OF
DOUBT, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, NO SUCH CLAIM BY
PARENT OR MERGER SUB SHALL BE SEPARATELY ASSERTED AGAINST THE STOCKHOLDERS
OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE.

 



 

(c) To the extent that any Losses which would otherwise be subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ were reflected in the
calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.12(a)_ or in the calculation of the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.13(a)_ (including items in the Final Closing Date Statement), were
expressly reflected in Working Capital or, other than with respect to any
Taxes, were reflected in the reserves and accruals in the Financial Statements
to the extent of those reserves and accruals, (i) Parent, Surviving
Corporation or other indemnitee shall not be able to recover for such Losses
from the Escrow Amount in each case only to the extent of the amount included

 



       
 

 



 

in such calculation, adjustment, accrual or reserve, and (ii) such Losses
shall not be counted in the determination of whether any deductible, basket,
cap or other threshold hereunder has been met, in each case only to the extent
of the amount included in such calculation, adjustment, accrual or reserve.

 



 

(d) In no event shall any indemnification of or recovery by the Surviving
Corporation or any other indemnitee for Losses pursuant to _Section 9.2_ that
are recoverable in excess of the Escrow Amount exceed, with respect to any
Fully-Diluted Stockholder, the amount of the Final Merger Consideration
actually received by such Person.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ with respect to any claim or
liability by any employee employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries arising
(i) as the result of the termination of such employees employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (unless the notice
of termination was provided prior to Closing) or (ii) as a result of the
hiring of any person on and after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 9.7(e)_ shall limit any right of Parent
Indemnified Parties with respect to any breaches of representations and
warranties in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) From and after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain or cause to be maintained customary property, casualty, business
interruption and other insurance in respect of the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with Parents general practices.

 



 

(g) Any amounts payable under _Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_ shall be
treated by Parent and the Fully-Diluted Stockholders as an adjustment to the
Final Merger Consideration, and shall be calculated after giving effect to (i)
any proceeds actually received from insurance policies (net of any deductible
or co-payment, Parents reasonable estimate of any increase in premiums
attributable to such recovery and all out of pocket costs and expenses related
to such recovery) covering the damage, loss, liability or expense that is the
subject to the claim for indemnity or (ii) any proceeds actually received from
third parties (net of any out of pocket costs and expenses related to such
recovery) through indemnification, counterclaim or reimbursement agreements or
otherwise in compensation for the subject matter of an indemnification claim
by such indemnitee (such arrangements referenced in _clauses (i)_ through
_(ii)_ in this _Section 9.7(g)_, collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_
"), and (iii) the Tax Advantage actually realized by the indemnitee resulting
from, or as a consequence of, the damage, loss, liability or expense that is
the subject of the indemnity.

 



 

(h) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall utilize their commercially
reasonable efforts, consistent with normal practices and policies and good
commercial practice, to mitigate any amounts payable under _Section 9.2_,
including pursuing rights and remedies to (i) collect any proceeds pursuant to
Alternative Arrangements covering the Loss that is the subject to the claim
for indemnity and (ii) obtain the Tax Advantage to the indemnitee resulting
from the Loss that is the subject of the indemnity; provided, that the
requirements in the foregoing _clause (i)_ (other than with respect to
insurance policies) shall be subject to the indemnitees good faith
determination that pursuing such other indemnification rights would not be
materially adverse to its business relationships. If any such proceeds,
benefits or recoveries are received by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any Losses after Parent or the Surviving Corporation

 



      
 

 



 

has received proceeds from the Escrow Amount, Parent or Surviving Corporation
shall promptly, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the receipt, realization or recovery of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries,
(i) deposit such proceeds, benefits or recoveries in the Escrow Account if the
Escrow Amount has not been released to the Fully-Diluted Shareholders pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement or (ii) if the Escrow Amount has been
released pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to
the Fully-Diluted Shareholders, shall distribute the amount to the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders in accordance with their respective Ownership
Percentages.

 



 

(i) The obligation to indemnify any indemnitee for Losses incurred by it in
connection with Response Actions on properties which are leased by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall arise only if and to the extent that Parent
or the Surviving Corporation has used commercially reasonable efforts to first
seek recovery from the owner of the property, provided that all costs incurred
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation related to such efforts to seek
recovery shall be promptly reimbursed from the Escrow Amount.

 



 

(j) Without limiting the generality of any of the provisions of this _Article
IX_, except with respect to claims based on fraud, Parent understands and
agrees that its right to indemnification under this _Article IX_ (as limited
by this _Section 9.7_) for breach of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.14_ shall constitute its sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any environmental, health, or safety matter relating to the
past, current or future facilities, properties or operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and all of their respective predecessors or Affiliates,
including any such matter arising under any Environmental Law. Aside from such
right to indemnification, Parent hereby waives any right, whether arising at
law or in equity, to seek contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other
recourse or remedy from the Escrow Amount or Fully-Diluted Stockholders, or
any Affiliate thereof, and hereby releases each such Person from any claim,
demand or liability, with respect to any such environmental, health, or safety
matter (including any matter arising under any Environmental Law). Except as
set forth above, Parent hereby unconditionally agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Fully-Diluted Stockholders from any and all liability, loss,
cost or expense with respect to any such environmental, health, or safety
matter (including any matter arising under any Environmental Law). Any
Response Action performed by Parent in connection with an alleged breach of
the representations in _Section 3.14_, as the alleged breach relates to
Environmental Claims, Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, shall be
performed in a Commercially Reasonable Manner. Parent shall not be entitled to
any indemnification hereunder for Losses related to a Response Action that
results from physically invasive tests of soil, groundwater or other
environmental media allowed by Parent or at Parents direction after the
Closing Date, unless such tests are (A) required to comply with Environmental
Law or the terms of any lease; (B) required by the directive of any
Governmental Authority; or (C) required by a judgment rendered in favor of any
Person.

 



 

(k) Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (each a " _Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
legal representatives, successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and
forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders, the Representative, and each of their respective past,
present or future officers, managers, directors, shareholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, employees, counsel and agents (each a " _Releasee_ ") of,
from and against any and all actions,

 



      
 

 



 

causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits
of every kind, nature and description whatsoever (collectively " _Claims_ ")
which such Releasor or its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns
ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever, arising out of or relating to any circumstance, agreement,
activity, action, omission, event or matter occurring or existing, in each
case, prior to the date of the Closing (collectively, " _Released Claims_ ");
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Released Claims shall
not include: (i) any claims that are expressly permitted pursuant to this
Agreement, the Stockholder Support Agreement or any other Related Agreements,
(ii) any indemnification claims by the Parent Indemnified Parties expressly
permitted pursuant to this _Article IX_, (iii) any claims to specifically
enforce any covenants or agreements of the Representative or any of the Fully-
Diluted Stockholders in this Agreement, the Stockholder Support Agreement or
any other Related Agreements, in each case, to the extent such covenant or
agreement, by its terms, expressly contemplates performance after the Closing
Date, (iv) any claims to enforce the covenants or agreements of any
Stockholder (other than a Designated Releasee) under the surviving provisions
of any Stockholder Agreements, (v) any claims with respect to the payment of
any adjustment amounts required to be paid in accordance with _Section
2.13(f)_; (vi) any claims based on fraud or resulting from any criminal acts;
or (vii) any claims that do not arise solely out of or in relation to such
Releasees capacity as a stockholder of the Company, other than with respect
to the Designated Releasees. Each Releasor agrees not to, and agrees to cause
its respective Affiliates and subsidiaries not to, assert any Released Claim
against the Releasees. For the sake of clarification, none of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed a Releasee for the purposes of
this _Section 9.7(k)_. In addition, each Releasor specifically waives the
benefit of the provisions of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of
California (" _Section 1542_"), which reads as follows:

 



 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH DEBTOR.

 



 

Each Releasor understands and acknowledges the significance and consequence of
this specific waiver of the provisions of Section 1542. Each Releasor
acknowledges that it has received or has had the opportunity to receive
independent legal advice from its attorneys regarding this waiver, and each
Releasor hereby assumes full responsibility for any damages, loss or liability
which it may hereunder incur by reason of such waiver.

 



 

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH FULLY-DILUTED
STOCKHOLDER WILL ONLY BE LIABLE SEVERALLY, AND NOT JOINTLY OR JOINTLY AND
SEVERALLY, FOR ANY OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FULLY-DILUTED
STOCKHOLDERS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS.

 



 

9.8 _Manner of Payment_. The payment of a claim for indemnification pursuant
to this _Article IX_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Representative or Parent, as
the case may be, within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the
amount thereof, whether pursuant to a final judgment, settlement or agreement
among the parties hereto; provided, that, to the extent that all or any
portion of any

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification payment to be made to any indemnitee is to be satisfied
through the Escrow Amount, the Representative and Parent shall, within three
(3) Business Days after the determination of the amount thereof, deliver joint
written instructions in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to the Escrow
Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to release the appropriate portion of the
Escrow Amount.

10.3 _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition
or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

 



 

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and such
counterparts may be delivered in electronic format (including by fax and
email). Such delivery of counterparts shall be conclusive evidence of the
intent to be bound hereby and each such counterpart and copies produced

10.5 _Interpretation_. The headings preceding the text of Articles and
Sections included in this Agreement and the headings to Sections of the
Disclosure Schedule are for convenience only and shall not be deemed part of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule or be given any effect in
interpreting this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule. The use of the
masculine, feminine or neuter gender herein shall not limit any provision of
this Agreement. The use of the terms "including" or "include" shall in all
cases herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include, without
limitation," respectively. The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and other
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the
Disclosure Schedule and all Exhibits hereto, as the same may be from time to
time amended, restated, modified or supplemented, and not to any particular
section, subsection, clause or subclause contained in this Agreement. Time is
of the essence of each and every covenant, agreement and obligation in this
Agreement. Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on
the other hand, shall be deemed to be in breach of any covenant contained in
this Agreement if such partys deemed breach is solely the result of any
action or inaction on the part of the other. All monetary figures shall be in
United States dollars, except where otherwise stated.

 



      
 

 



 

10.6 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT

JURISDICTION.

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
(including by operation of law) by any party without the prior written consent
of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the consent of any
party, Parent may assign its rights and/or obligations hereunder to (a) one or
more direct or indirect subsidiaries of Parent, (b) any lender providing
financing (or any agent or collateral trustee for such lender) (including
pursuant to the terms thereof to the extent necessary for the purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning this Agreement and
its rights hereunder as collateral in respect of such financing) or (c)
following the Closing, any successor-in-interest to Parent or any third party
purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that no such assignment will relieve Parent of its
obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in contravention of
this _Section 10.8_ shall be null and void.

 



 

10.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the parties hereto and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
confer upon third parties, either express or implied, any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) subject to _Section 10.18_, if the
Closing is consummated, the Fully-Diluted Stockholders shall be third party

thereof. In addition to the foregoing, Mayer Brown LLP (including its partners
and employees) shall be a third party beneficiary of _Sections 5.17_ and

(including specific performance or other equitable relief) in the event of any
breach thereof.

Representative, each party will on and after the Closing Date execute and
deliver to the other parties such other documents, assignments and other
instruments as may be reasonably required to effectuate completely the Merger,

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF ANY FEDERAL COURT SHOULD DECIDE THAT IT

COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

 



 

10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING THE FINANCING PARTIES. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.13_.

 



 

10.14 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule shall identify exceptions
and other matters with respect to the representations and warranties of the
Company herein and be arranged in certain specific sections corresponding to
the sections of _Article III_ of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter
in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the representations
and warranties of the Company in such corresponding section of _Article III_
and shall qualify any other section of _Article III_ to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
relevant to such section of _Article III_. The inclusion of information in
the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In
addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the
Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth
of any such

 



      
 

 



 

amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of setting forth
or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy
between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

10.15 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the remedies and
limitations set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 8.4_) shall be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases (a) the
liability of any party (or the liability of any Financing Party) or any of its
stockholders, partners, members, managers, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents or (b) the obligations hereunder.

 



 

10.16 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any federal,
state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise.

 



 

10.17 _Provision Respecting Representation of the Company_. Each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its directors, member, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that
Mayer Brown LLP may serve as counsel to each and any member of the Seller
Group, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Mayer Brown LLP may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any
director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group,
in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries,

 



      
 

 



 

and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict
of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any
Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation.

 



 

10.18 _Authority and Rights of the Representative; Limitations on Liability_.
The Representative shall have such powers and authority as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement and
the Related Agreements. All actions, notices, communications and
determinations by the Representative to carry out such functions shall
conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and shall be binding upon,
the Fully-Diluted Stockholders. Neither the Representative nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates will
have any liability to the Company or the Fully-Diluted Stockholders with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in such
capacity (or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives or Affiliates in connection therewith), except with respect to
the Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other
agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Representative) shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The foregoing
shall in no way limit the rights of the Representative pursuant to the
Stockholder Support Agreements.
