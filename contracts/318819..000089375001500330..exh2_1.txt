Greenwich Water System, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of AWW ("GWS" and together with AWW, the "Sellers") and
Aquarion Company, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer").   Background   A.
Connecticut-American Water Company, a Connecticut corporation

per share (the "Common Stock"), and 3,050 of its 6,890 shares of preferred
stock, par value $100 per share (the "Preferred Stock"), of the Company as

Sellers, and the Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, for the consideration
hereinafter provided, all of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and
Preferred Stock of the Company owned by the Sellers (collectively, the

representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS   1.1. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the

ARTICLE II  THE TRANSACTION   2.1. The Purchase and Sale.   (a) Purchase
and Sale of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to sell, assign and
convey the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, acquire and accept
the Shares from the Sellers.   (b) American Water Capital Corp. Debt. At the
Closing, Buyer shall pay to American Water Capital Corp. by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to all liabilities and
obligations owed by the Company to American Water Capital Corp. as of the
Closing Date as stated in the pay-off letter from American Water Capital
Corp. dated as of the Closing Date (the "AWCC Debt").   (c) Purchase Price.
In addition to the payment of the AWCC Debt, the aggregate purchase price for
the Shares (the "Purchase Price") shall be equal to (i) two (2) times the
Total Stockholders\' Equity of the Company as of the Closing Date plus (ii)
$400,000. "Total Stockholders\' Equity" shall mean the amount equal to the
common stockholders\' equity of the Company plus the amount of all preferred
stocks of the Company owned by AWW as such items    4   are properly
accrued and reflected on the books and records of the Company in accordance
with Pro Forma GAAP. "Pro Forma GAAP" means Adjusted GAAP as specifically
adjusted as set forth on Schedule 2.1(c) hereto and reflected in the July 31,
2001 balance sheet previously delivered by the Sellers and agreed to by Buyer
(the "Pro Forma Balance Sheet"). "Adjusted GAAP" means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, (i) using the same accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, with consistent classification,
judgments, estimation methodology, as were used by the Company in preparing
the December 31, 2000 balance sheet of the Company, (ii) without taking into
account the pay-off of the AWCC Debt and any changes in circumstances or
events occurring after the opening of business on the Closing Date and (iii)
after giving effect to the elimination of intercompany payables and
receivables pursuant to Section 5.14.   (d) Payment of Initial Cash Payment.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Initial Cash
Payment shall be paid by Buyer on the Closing Date by wire transfers of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Sellers in
writing at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date. The
"Initial Cash Payment" shall mean an amount in cash equal to two (2) times
the Total Stockholders\' Equity Estimate as defined in Section 2.1(e)(i) plus
$400,000. Payments shall be allocated between AWW and GWS in accordance with
Schedule 2.1(d) hereto.   (e) Adjustment to Purchase Price.   (i) Pre-
Closing Statement. At least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date,
AWW shall furnish to Buyer a statement of the Company (the "Pre-Closing
Statement"), prepared as of the last day of the latest month ending at least
20 days prior to the Closing Date, reflecting the Sellers\' good faith
estimate of the Total Stockholders\' Equity of the Company immediately prior
to the Closing Date (the "Total Stockholders\' Equity Estimate").   (ii)
Post-Closing Statement.   (A) As soon as practicable, but in no event more
than 60 business days after the Closing Date, AWW shall furnish to Buyer
a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") reflecting the Total
Stockholders\' Equity of the Company immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Closing Total Stockholders\' Equity Amount") prepared in accordance with Pro
Forma GAAP. Each of Buyer and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective auditors to, provide the other party and their representatives
with reasonable access to any information, including work papers, necessary
to prepare or review the Post-Closing Statement. Buyer shall make available
any employees of the Company reasonably necessary to assist in the timely
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement. Each of Buyer and AWW shall, and
shall cause its auditors (if used), agents and representatives to, cooperate
and assist in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and in the
conduct of any reviews and dispute resolution process referred to in this
Section 2.1.   (B) Within 30 business days after the delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement to Buyer, Buyer shall either accept the amount (whether a
positive or negative number) equal to the difference between the
Closing Total Stockholders\' Equity Amount minus the Total Stockholders\'
Equity Estimate (the "Proposed Closing Differential") as reflected on
the Post-Closing Statement as correct or object to the Proposed
Closing Differential, specifying in reasonable detail in writing the nature
of its objection(s) (including any supporting schedules,   
5   analyses, working papers and other documentation); provided, however,
that Buyer may only include objections based on mathematical errors or a
claim that Total Stockholders\' Equity was not determined in accordance with
Pro Forma GAAP; provided further, that Buyer\'s objections to any matters
other than mathematical errors must equal at least a $550,000 adjustment to
the Purchase Price (the "Designated Amount"). In the event Buyer does not
object to the Proposed Closing Differential within said 30-business day
period, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the Proposed Closing
Differential as the "Closing Differential." In the event Buyer objects to the
Proposed Closing Differential, then, during a 15-business day period
subsequent to the receipt by AWW of notice of Buyer\'s objection(s), Buyer
and AWW shall attempt in good faith to resolve the differences respecting
such Proposed Closing Differential. In the event Buyer and AWW are unable to
resolve their differences within said 15-business day period, the parties
agree that the matter shall be submitted to Arthur Andersen LLP or such other
independent accountants mutually agreed to by the Sellers and Buyer, the
costs and expenses of which firm shall be allocated between Buyer and AWW so
that Buyer\'s share of such costs and expenses shall be in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed amounts so submitted by
Buyer to Arthur Andersen LLP or such other independent accountants mutually
agreed to by the Sellers and Buyer that is unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer
(as finally determined by Arthur Andersen LLP or such other independent
accountants mutually agreed to by the Sellers and Buyer) bears to the total
amount of the disputed amounts so submitted by Buyer. Such certified public
accountants shall determine the Closing Differential pursuant to this Section
2.1 and such determination shall be final and binding upon the parties;
provided, however, that such accountants shall (x) limit their review to
those issues specifically disputed by Buyer in its notice of objections, (y)
further limit their review to whether the Post-Closing Statement contained
mathematical errors or the Proposed Closing Differential was calculated in
accordance with Pro Forma GAAP and (z) not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by Buyer and AWW or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or AWW.   (C) Based on
the Post-Closing Statement, within three (3) business days after the final
determination of the Closing Differential, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted and any differential shall be paid as follows: If the amount of the
Closing Differential is a positive amount which is greater than the
Designated Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by an
amount equal to two (2) times the Closing Differential, with interest thereon
at a rate equal to five percent (5%) per annum from the Closing Date to the
date of payment. In such case, Buyer shall make a payment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Sellers in the amount of the increase of
the Purchase Price resulting from such adjustment. Conversely, if the amount
of the Closing Differential is a negative amount which is greater than the
Designated Amount, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an
amount equal to two (2) times the Closing Differential (expressed as a
positive amount), with interest thereon at a rate equal to five percent (5%)
per annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment. In such case, the
Sellers shall make a payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to Buyer in the amount of the decrease in the Purchase Price resulting from
such adjustment.   2.2. Closing. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated
pursuant to Section 7, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares
(the "Closing") will take place as promptly as practicable, but no later than
two (2) business days following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Section 6, at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett, 425
Lexington    6   Avenue, New York, New York unless another place or time
is agreed to in writing by Buyer and AWW. The date upon which the Closing
actually occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date."   ARTICLE
III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS   For purposes of this
Agreement, the exceptions, modifications, descriptions and disclosures in any
Schedule attached hereto are made for all purposes of this Agreement and are
exceptions to all representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement

AWW and GWS, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to Buyer as
follows:   3.1. Corporate Status. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and is qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is required to be so
qualified, except where the failure so to qualify would not, individually or

certificate of incorporation and by-laws as amended through the date hereof,
each of which is in full force and effect. The Company has no
subsidiaries.   3.2. Authorization and Enforceability. The Company has the
requisite power and authority to own its property and to carry on its

and documents contemplated hereby or thereby (the "Transaction Documents")
to which it is a party and to perform the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. Such execution, delivery and performance by each of AWW and GWS
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. Each
Transaction Document to which it is a party executed and delivered by AWW or
GWS has been duly executed and delivered by AWW or GWS, as the case may be,
and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of AWW or GWS, as the
case may be, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms.
As of the Closing Date, each of the other Transaction Documents to which AWW,
GWS or the Company is a party will be duly executed and delivered by such
party and will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of such
party enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.   3.3.
Consents and Approvals.   (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3(a),
neither the execution and delivery by AWW or GWS of the Transaction Documents

and (iii) violate or conflict with the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws
or other similar governing documents of AWW or GWS, except in the case of any

would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or render impracticable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder.   7    (b) Except as set forth on Schedule
3.3(b), neither the execution and delivery by AWW or GWS of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, nor the performance by each of them or by

applicable to the Company, (iii) violate or conflict with the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws or other similar governing documents of the Company,

cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of the Company
(including without limitation, the obligation of the Company to prepay any
outstanding indebtedness) under any provision of any agreement, contract or
other instrument binding upon the Company or any license, franchise, permit
or similar authorization held by the Company, or (v) result in the creation
or imposition of any lien, encumbrance, charge or claim upon any of the
assets of the Company, except in the case of any of the foregoing clauses
(i)-(v) for any such violation, conflict, default, right or lien which would
not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or render impracticable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder.   (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3(c), the
execution, delivery and performance by AWW and GWS of this Agreement and the
consummation by each of them or of the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not require any consent from or filing with any person
or governmental body, agency or official except for (i) the filing of a

or similar state regulatory bodies ("PUCs"), each of which is identified on
Schedule 3.3(c); and (iv) consents and filings which, if not obtained or
made, will not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or render impracticable the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.   3.4. Capitalization and Stock

of 30,000 shares of Preferred Stock, 6,890 shares of which are issued

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.4(c), there are no voting trusts,

or which impose any restrictions upon the sale or disposition of, any capital
stock of the Company.   8    3.5. Financial Statements.   (a) Schedule
3.5(a) sets forth (i) the audited balance sheet of the Company as of December

the Interim Financials have been prepared in accordance with the books and
records of the Company. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(a), (A) the

in conformity with Adjusted GAAP and (B) the Interim Financials fairly
present, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as
of July 31, 2001 and the results of operations of the Company for the 7-month
period then ended in conformity with Adjusted GAAP (except for the absence of
footnotes and for normal year end adjustments). All references in this

other agreement with a labor organization), whether written or unwritten,
qualified or nonqualified, funded or unfunded, foreign or domestic, (i)

would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001 of

respect of any Employee or former employee of the Company, or (ii) with

reasonably be expected to enhance benefits under such Benefit Plan.   (c)
Each Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (as designated on Schedule 3.11(a)) has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to such Benefit Plan\'s qualification
under Section 401(a) of the Code or has remaining a period of time under an
applicable remedial amendment period in which to apply for such letter and to
the Knowledge of the Sellers nothing has occurred whether by action or
failure to act, which is reasonably likely to cause the loss or denial of
such qualification. Neither AWW nor the Company has received correspondence
from the IRS relating to the failure of any such Benefit Plan to be qualified
or the failure to be otherwise in compliance with Section 401(a) of the
Code.    15    (d) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.11(d), each Benefit

Liabilities") to any material liability or Tax under the Code or ERISA (other
than claims for benefits in the ordinary course).   (g) No Benefit Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. All

any Benefit Plan have been duly and timely made except for such failure as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.   (h) Except as disclosed on
Schedule 3.11(h), there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers,

assessments, complaints, proceedings or investigations of any kind in any
court or governmental agency with respect to any Benefit Plan.   (i) No
liability under Title IV of ERISA related to the termination of or withdrawal

incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA related to
the termination of or withdrawal from any plan.   (j) None of AWW, the
Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, any ERISA Affiliate has engaged

of the Code.   (k) No "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in
Section 302(a)(2) of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived,
exists with respect to any Benefit Plan.   (l) No Benefit Plan has
experienced a "Reportable Event" (as such term is defined in Section 4043(c)

the reporting requirement which would be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.   (m) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is
funded wholly or partially through an insurance policy, all premiums required
to have been paid to date under the insurance policy have been paid, all
premiums required to be paid under the insurance policy through the Closing
Date will have been paid on or before the Closing Date, in each case except
for such failure as would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect and, as of the    16   Closing Date, there will be no
material liability of the Company under any insurance policy or ancillary
agreement with respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a
retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring
prior to the Closing Date.   (n) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.11(n),
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event (i.e., a "double trigger") will pursuant to the terms of any
Benefit Plan (i) restrict or prohibit AWW or any ERISA Affiliate from
amending any Benefit Plan, (ii) result in any material payment (except for
severance payments required by the terms of this Agreement) (including,
without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "Excess Parachute
Payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of
indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any Employee or former Employee of
the Company under any Benefit Plan, (iii) materially increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan, or (iv) result in any acceleration
of the time of payment or vesting of any benefits under any Benefit Plan.  
(o) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.11(o), no Benefit Plan provides welfare
benefits, including without limitation, death or medical benefits, beyond
termination of service or retirement other than (i) coverage mandated by law,
or (ii) death benefits under a Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code or a nonqualified pension or retirement plan. Seller has made
available to Buyer all such Benefit Plans (or written summaries of any such
unwritten Benefit Plan) disclosed on Schedule 3.11(o).   (p) With respect to
plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, AWW and its ERISA Affiliates have made
all required minimum funding contributions, as required by ERISA and the
Code, other than failures to contribute that do not present a material risk
to AWW or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a material liability under ERISA
or the Code.   3.12. Absence of Changes or Events. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.12 or in any other Schedule to this Agreement, since the Balance

burdensome restrictions. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, since December

hereby, to respectively use their best efforts to prevent the entry,

that nothing in this Section 5.6 shall require either party or their
respective Affiliates to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or take
any action or suffer an event to exist if such sale, holding separate,
disposition, action or event would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or either party.   5.7. Further Assurances. Upon the terms and

announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any United
States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall allow AWW or Buyer, as the case may
be, reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.   5.10. Employee Matters.   (a) Employees - Continued
Employment; Compensation and Benefits. Subject to the following sentence,
Buyer agrees to continue the employment immediately following the Closing
Date of each employee covered under the collective bargaining agreements (the
"Collective Bargaining Agreements") between the Company and Local No. 384 of
the Utility Workers Union of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O., in effect on the Closing
Date (the "Union Employees") and each employee of the Company who is not
covered under the Collective Bargaining Agreements and the employee(s) of
American Water Works Service Company identified on Schedule 5.10(a) who will
be transferred to the Company on or before the Closing Date (the "Non-Union
Employees"; collectively with the Union Employees, the "Employees"). Union
Employees who are laid off or on disability leave, authorized leave of
absence or military service as of the Closing Date shall be offered
employment by, or have their employment continue with, Buyer to the same
extent, if any, as the Sellers would be required to offer employment in
accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreements, any Benefit Plan or
applicable law. Non-Union Employees who are on disability leave or authorized
leave of absence or in military service as of the Closing Date shall be
offered employment by, or shall have their employment continue with, Buyer to
the same extent, if any, as the Sellers would be required to offer employment
or continue employment in accordance with applicable law or any Benefit Plan.
With respect to the Union Employees, Buyer shall continue their employment
and provide pay and benefits and benefit plans, programs and policies in
accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreements and the American Water
Works Benefits Negotiations Memorandum of Agreement, dated March 7, 2001 (the
"MOA"). With respect to the Non-Union Employees (and former employees to the
extent applicable), Buyer shall provide and continue in effect for one year
following the Closing Date, compensation and benefit plans, programs and
policies which are substantially comparable to those provided to the
Employees (and former employees to the extent applicable) by the Sellers, the
Company or their Affiliates on the date hereof (excluding the Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan). For the one-year period following the
Closing Date, such Non-Union Employees\' employment shall be continued in
the     27   same or substantially comparable positions and at rates of
pay at least equal to the rates of pay in effect on the Closing Date. For
purposes of this Section 5.10(a), references to "pay" with respect to such
Non-Union Employees shall include base pay plus any commission, bonus or
incentive pay. In addition, for one year following the Closing Date, the
principal worksite of each such Employee shall be at a location within a
35-mile radius of such Employee\'s location of employment as of the Closing
Date subject, in the case of Union Employees, to any applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreements and the MOA. Schedule 5.10(a) (which shall be updated
by the Sellers on the Closing Date) shall set forth the name of each
Employee, and his or her current rate of pay, position and date of hire, and
in the case of those Employees on disability leave, military service or leave
of absence, the period of, or cause for, such leave. Employees shall be
provided credit by Buyer for all service with the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates (and any other entity to the extent credit has been given by a
plan of either the Sellers or their ERISA Affiliates), to the same extent as
such service was credited for such purpose by the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates, under (x) all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
fringe benefits of Buyer for all purposes including, without limitation, of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual and (y) severance plans, programs
and policies for all purposes including, without limitation, calculating the
amount of each Employee\'s severance benefits, except in each case to the
extent duplication of benefits would result. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall cause any Employee to be other than an
employee at will and nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will
obligate Buyer to provide continued employment to any individual Employee for
any specified period of time following the Closing Date. Buyer will be the
sole judge of the number, identity and qualifications of employees necessary
for the conduct of its business operations and reserves the right to take any
personnel action it deems necessary or appropriate with respect to the
Employees, subject, in the case of Union Employees, to any applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreements and the MOA. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 5.10(a), with respect to pay and benefits for Non-Union
Employees, Sections 5.10(b), (c), (e) and (f) and as may be required under
any Benefit Plan or applicable law, Buyer shall be under no obligation to
provide or continue any Benefit Plan or any other plan or arrangement
after the Closing Date and may amend or terminate any such plan or
arrangement in whole or in part and may modify any provision thereof. Buyer
shall only be obligated to provide Union Employees with the pay and benefits
specified in the Collective Bargaining Agreements and the MOA, as such
agreements may be amended, modified or terminated consistent with Buyer\'s
obligations under applicable law.   (b) Savings Plan Account Transfer.  
(i) As soon as practicable, but in no event more than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will designate an existing or establish a new savings
plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) and including a cash or deferred
feature under Code Section 401(k) and a related trust thereunder which shall
be exempt under Code Section 501(a) ("Buyer\'s Savings Plan"). With respect
to the Non-Union Employees, benefits under Buyer\'s Savings Plan will be
substantially comparable in all respects to the Sellers\' Savings Plan
(as defined below) as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, except that
new contributions to Buyer\'s Savings Plan after the Closing Date will not
be invested in the common stock of AWW.   (ii) The Sellers will, as soon as
practicable after Buyer establishes or designates Buyer\'s Savings Plan and
provides the Sellers with an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Sellers that Buyer\'s Savings Plan is qualified under Code section
401(a), cause    28   the Savings Plan for Employees of American Water
Works Company, Inc. and its Designated Subsidiaries ("Sellers\' 401(k) Plan")
to transfer to Buyer\'s Savings Plan, the full account balances of the
Employees and former employees of the Company who are participating in
Sellers\' 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date (including for
purposes of such transfer any balance held for an Alternate Payee, as that
term is defined by section 414(p) of the Code, of any Employee or former
employee of the Company, who is entitled to any benefit thereunder pursuant
to the terms of a domestic relations order that has been determined by the
administrator of Sellers\' 401(k) Plan to be qualified within the meaning of
section 414(p) of the Code) (herein, the "Participating Employees"),
determined as of the date of transfer, and determined without regard to any
applicable vesting schedule under Sellers\' 401(k) Plan. That transfer shall
be made in kind based on those investment funds (including the AWW common
stock fund) in which such account balances are then invested; provided,
however, that any loans from Sellers\' 401(k) Plan to the Participating
Employees shall be transferred in the form of notes. The Sellers and Buyer
shall make all required filings and submissions to the appropriate
governmental agencies in connection with such transfer.   (iii) In
consideration for the transfer of assets described herein, Buyer shall,
effective as of the date of transfer described herein, assume all of the
obligations of Sellers\' Savings Plan and the Sellers and their ERISA
Affiliates in respect of the account balances accumulated by
the Participating Employees under Sellers\' Savings Plan as of such date
of transfer; provided that Buyer shall not assume, and the Sellers shall
retain, any other obligations arising under or attributable to Sellers\'
Savings Plan.   (iv) If the account balances transferred as provided in
(ii) above are determined, within one year after Closing, to have been
incorrect, the Sellers and Buyer agree to make appropriate payments or asset
transfers to correct such error (appropriately adjusted for subsequent
investment experience and expenses incurred).   (c) Pension Plan Spin-
off.   (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer will designate
an existing, or establish a new, pension plan qualified under Code Section
401(a) and a related trust thereunder which shall be exempt under Code
Section 501(a) ("Buyer\'s Pension Plan"). With respect to the Non-Union
Employees, benefits under Buyer\'s Pension Plan shall be substantially
comparable in all respects to Sellers\' Pension Plan (as defined below) as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, and subject to the Sellers\' receipt of an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers that Buyer\'s Pension Plan is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the Sellers shall cause the
trustee of the Pension Plan for Employees of American Water Works, Inc. and
its Designated Subsidiaries ("Sellers\' Pension Plan") to segregate, in
accordance with the spinoff provisions set forth under Section 414(l) of the
Code, and to transfer to Buyer\'s Pension Plan, the assets of Sellers\'
Pension Plan allocable under ERISA Section 4044 (determined using the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation assumptions set forth in 29 C.F.R. Part 4044 and
the assumptions set forth on Schedule 5.10(c)) to the Employees who were
participants in Sellers\' Pension Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
(including, for purposes of such transfer, benefits held for an Alternate
Payee, as that term is defined by Section 414(p) of the Code, of any Employee
who is entitled to benefits thereunder pursuant to the terms of a domestic
relations order that has been determined by the administrator of Sellers\'
Pension Plan to be qualified within the meaning of Section    
29   414(p) of the Code) and former employees of the Company (other than
those for whom an annuity has been purchased) (herein, the "Pension
Participating Employees"), such amount to be calculated as of the Closing
Date, but adjusted for benefit payments and reasonable administrative
expenses attributable to such Pension Participating Employees between the
Closing Date and the transfer date. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Sellers
and Buyer, the form of the assets to be transferred shall consist of cash.
The Sellers and Buyer shall make all required filings and submissions to the
appropriate governmental agencies in connection with such asset transfer.  
(ii) In consideration for the transfer of assets described herein, Buyer
shall, effective as of the date of transfer described herein, assume all of
the obligations of Sellers\' Pension Plan and the Sellers and their ERISA
Affiliates in respect of benefits accrued by Pension Participating Employees
under Sellers\' Pension Plan on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that
Buyer shall not assume, and the Sellers shall retain, any other obligations
arising under or attributable to Sellers\' Pension Plan.   (iii) If the
assets transferred are thereafter determined, within one year after Closing,
to have been incorrect, the Sellers and Buyer agree to make appropriate
payments or asset transfers to correct such error (appropriately adjusted for
subsequent investment experience and expenses incurred).   (iv) The Sellers
shall, at their own cost and expense, take such corrective actions with
respect to the Sellers\' Pension Plan as the IRS may require as a condition
to continuing the qualified status of the Sellers\' Pension Plan in
connection with its audit of the Sellers\' Pension Plan for the 1998 plan
year and shall notify Buyer of any such corrective actions so required by the
IRS or so taken by the Sellers. In the event that any such corrective actions
have not been taken or completed as of the date of the transfer of assets
described herein and such corrective actions affect the assets transferred to
or the obligations assumed by Buyer as provided herein, the Sellers shall
reimburse Buyer upon demand for Buyer\'s reasonable cost of taking or
completing such corrective actions with respect to such assets
or obligations, without regard to the limitations set forth in Article 8 of
this Agreement.   (d) Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The Sellers and the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Employees of American Water Works, Inc. and
its Designated Subsidiaries ("Sellers\' ESOP") shall retain all liabilities
for benefits accrued under Sellers\' ESOP for any Employees or former
employees and shall cause those benefits to be paid for Employees, former
employees and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of Sellers\'
ESOP.   (e) Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations.   (i) Effective as of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall designate an existing, or establish or cause to
be established a new, group insurance plan ("Buyer\'s Group Insurance Plan")
and one or more related trusts (Buyer\'s VEBA) for the purpose of funding
claims under Buyer\'s Group Insurance Plan, which trust or trusts shall meet
the requirements of Code Sections 419, 419A, 501 and 501(c)(9), in order to
provide medical and dental coverage, group-term life insurance coverage, Code
Section 125 cafeteria plan coverage, medical and dependent care expense
reimbursement account coverage, short- and long-term disability coverage,
retiree medical and dental coverage and post-retirement life insurance
coverage for the benefit of the Employees and former employees of the Company
who were participants in Sellers\' Group    30   Insurance Plan (as
described on Schedule 3.11(a)) and related trust or trusts ("Sellers\' VEBA")
immediately prior to the Closing Date (herein, the "Welfare Participating
Employees"); provided that a Non-Union Employee who is on disability leave or
authorized leave of absence or in military service on the Closing Date shall
become a Welfare Participating Employee as of the date such Employee returns
to work with Buyer or its affiliates. With respect to the Non-Union
Employees, benefits under Buyer\'s Group Insurance Plan shall
be substantially comparable to Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing.   (ii) Effective as of the Closing
Date, all liabilities to or relating to Welfare Participating Employees under
Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan and VEBA with respect to medical and dental
coverage, group-term life insurance coverage, Code Section 125 cafeteria plan
coverage, medical and dependent care expense reimbursement account coverage
and short- and long-term disability coverage shall cease to be liabilities of
Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan and VEBA and shall be assumed by Buyer\'s
Group Insurance Plan and VEBA.   (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
claims incurred by a Welfare Participating Employee prior to the Closing Date
shall be paid by Seller\'s Group Insurance Plan and VEBA but Buyer shall be
responsible for all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from
such claims on or after the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, a claim is
deemed incurred when the services that are the subject of the claim are
performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death occurs; in the case
of a hospital stay, when the person first enters the hospital; and in the
case of continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, when the person first becomes eligible for such
continuation coverage.   (iv) The Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to
assist Buyer to enter into such group insurance policies and contracts with
third-party administrators as Buyer considers appropriate, such policies and
contracts to become effective as of the Closing Date.   (v) The Sellers
shall provide Buyer with a list of all Employees who are eligible as of the
Closing Date to receive retiree medical or dental coverage or post-retirement
life insurance coverage under Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan and the type of
retiree medical or dental coverage and the level of life insurance coverage
for which they are eligible, as applicable. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall assume full liability for the foregoing coverages under Sellers\'
Group Insurance Plan with respect to such Employees and shall assume full
liability for such coverages for the Employees who have not satisfied the
requirements for such retiree medical or dental coverage or post-retirement
life insurance coverage under Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan as of the
Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall cause the trustee of Sellers\' VEBA to transfer to the trustee of
Buyer\'s VEBA assets equal to the amount of assets in the Sellers\' VEBA as
of the Closing Date, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is equal
to the Accumulated Post-Retirement Benefit Obligation under FAS 106 ("APBO")
for the current and former employees of the Company and the denominator of
which is the APBO for the Sellers as a whole. APBO shall be calculated by the
Sellers\' actuary using the actuarial assumptions set forth on Schedule
5.10(e). For at least one year after the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain
retiree medical and dental coverage and post-retirement life insurance
coverage that is substantially identical to that provided by Sellers\' Group
Insurance Plan for all Employees (and former employees of the Company covered
by Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan who retire on or before the Closing Date).
Thereafter, subject to the terms of any applicable plan and applicable law,
all Employees and former employees (other    31   than Employees hired
after any discontinuation after the date of this Agreement of the Sellers\'
policy of offering retiree welfare benefits to new hires) shall be entitled
to receive retiree welfare benefits no less favorable than those provided to
Buyer\'s retirees who were hired prior to July 1, 1996. Set forth on Schedule
5.10(e) is a list of all former Company employees who, as of the date of this
Agreement, are receiving retiree medical or dental coverage or post-
retirement life insurance coverage under Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan and
the type and level of coverage that each is receiving, and the Sellers shall
provide Buyer with an update of such list on or prior to the Closing Date
providing such information as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall assume
liability for providing retiree medical and dental coverage and post-
retirement life insurance coverage to such former Company employees
in accordance with this Section.   (vi) Buyer shall cause Buyer\'s Group
Insurance Plan to recognize and give credit for all amounts applied to
deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums, and other applicable benefit coverage
limits with respect to which such expenses have been incurred by the Welfare
Participating Employees under Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan. Buyer shall
waive any waiting periods or limitations for preexisting conditions under
Buyer\'s Group Insurance Plan with respect to the Welfare Participating
Employees.   (vii) To the extent any Welfare Participating
Employee contributed to a dependent care or medical expense reimbursement
account under Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan during the calendar year that
includes the Closing Date, the Sellers shall transfer to Buyer\'s Group
Insurance Plan the account balances of Welfare Participating Employees for
such calendar year under the dependent care and medical expense reimbursement
accounts maintained under Sellers\' Group Insurance Plan, and Buyer\'s Group
Insurance Plan shall provide dependent care and medical expense reimbursement
account programs substantially comparable to those provided under Sellers\'
Group Insurance Plan to the Welfare Participating Employees at least through
the end of the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date; provided, that
notwithstanding paragraph (iii) above, the Buyer shall be responsible for all
liability for and administration of reimbursement claims that have not been
received by Sellers as of the date Sellers transfer assets to Buyer,
regardless of when the claim was incurred.   (viii) Subject to any
confidentiality limitations reasonably required by Sellers, both the Sellers
and Buyer shall, to the extent reasonably available, have access to claims
data, eligibility data and disability, medical and demographic data for all
historical periods for all vendors administering Sellers\' and Buyer\'s Group
Insurance Plan and VEBAs with respect to the Welfare Participating Employees.
Both the Sellers and Buyer shall have the right to access and use such data
for such purposes as each determines is reasonably necessary. Each party
shall pay the cost, if any, of collection and delivery of such data requested
by it.   (f) Severance Plans. For a period of at least one year following
the Closing Date, Buyer will continue in effect, in accordance with their
terms on the date hereof, the severance plans included on Schedule 5.10(f)
(including the Enhanced Severance Plan and the Severance Policy), or
provide substantially comparable benefits under a severance plan maintained
by Buyer. Except for employees terminated or laid off as a result of the
actions contemplated by Section 5.20, Buyer or Buyer\'s severance plan will
pay all severance benefits to which the Employees become entitled on or after
the Closing Date including, without limitation, any entitlement arising under
the Sellers\' or the Company\'s severance plans on account of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   32    (g) Collective
Bargaining Agreements. Buyer will assume and honor the terms of the
Collective Bargaining Agreements and the MOA and will recognize any labor
organization or other collective bargaining representative of such Employees,
subject to and to the extent required by the National Labor Relations Act or
any other applicable law.   5.11. Violations. Within fifteen (15) days after
the receipt of notice of violation, the Sellers shall notify Buyer of any
violations of state or federal drinking water standards which, if such
violations existed on the date hereof, would be required to be disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.14(j) hereof, and shall promptly notify Buyer of the
actions proposed to be taken by the Sellers to correct or otherwise respond
to such violations.   5.12. Transition Plan. Within 30 days after the
execution date of this Agreement, the parties jointly shall establish a
transitional services team, which shall include expertise from various
functional specialties associated with or involved in providing rate
regulation, human resources, accounting, engineering, laboratory, billing,
payroll and other support services provided to the Company by any automated
or manual process using facilities or employees that are not included among
the Company\'s assets or Employees. Such team will be responsible for
preparing, and timely implementing, a transition plan which will identify and
describe substantially all of the various transition activities that the
parties will cause to occur before and after Closing and any other transfer
of control matters that any party reasonably believes should be addressed in
such transition plan. The transition plan will set forth reasonable
arrangements providing Buyer, at Buyer\'s sole expense, with appropriate
access to the Sellers\' relevant computer systems to allow for a full
conversion of the relevant data and functionality to Buyer\'s systems on the
Closing Date and for the provision by the Sellers or their Affiliates
of appropriate services to the Buyer as may be necessary or desirable to
effect a reasonable transition on the Closing Date, including the transfer to
Buyer of originals or copies of engineering, laboratory, human resources,
accounting and other data and records in advance of the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall make arrangements satisfactory to Buyer for the transfer to
Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date, of originals or copies of all books
and records and other data and information relating to the Company, its
properties, business and operations, which is in the possession or control of
the Sellers and their Affiliates. Buyer and the Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their representatives on such
transition team to cooperate in good faith and take all reasonable steps
necessary to develop a mutually acceptable transition plan no later than 60
days prior to the Closing Date, and if requested by Buyer, on or prior to the
Closing Date, the parties hereto agree to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate and execute on or prior to the Closing Date an agreement
with respect to those transition services specified by Buyer (the "Transition
Services Agreement"). The term of each transitional service shall be as
agreed between the parties in such Transition Services Agreement but in no
event shall extend beyond December 31, 2002.   5.13. Tax Matters.   (a)
AWW shall cause to be prepared and filed all federal, state, foreign or local
corporation income tax returns required to be filed by the Company for
taxable periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date or which include the
Closing Date (including consolidated, combined or unitary federal, state and
local income tax returns which include the Company and including amended
returns, applications for loss carryback refunds (Forms 1139)
and applications for estimated tax refunds (Forms 4466)) (all such income
tax returns, amended    33   returns and refund applications, whether
separate, consolidated, combined or unitary, are referred to as the
"Seller\'s Returns"). The Seller\'s Returns shall be prepared, where
relevant, in a manner consistent with the Company\'s past practices except to
the extent counsel for AWW reasonably determines that under applicable law
there is no reasonable basis therefor. Buyer shall cause the Company to
submit pro-forma federal, state, and local income tax returns (tax return
packages) for calendar year 2001 and for the taxable year ending on the
Closing Date to AWW. AWW shall advise of the date or dates on which
it intends to file Seller\'s Returns and Buyer shall provide AWW with the
related pro forma return within 45 days prior to the intended filing date,
but Buyer shall not be required to deliver a pro forma return sooner than 45
days after AWW\'s request therefor. AWW and Buyer shall, unless prohibited by
applicable law, elect to close the taxable period of the Company (for
federal, state and local income Tax purposes) as of the close of the Closing
Date, subject to the application of the "next day rule" provided in Treas.
Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). In any case where applicable law does
not permit the Company to close its taxable period on the Closing Date, any
Taxes attributable to a taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date shall be allocated (i) for the account of the Sellers for the
period up to and including the Closing Date, and (ii) for the account of the
Company and Buyer for the period subsequent to the Closing Date, and such
allocation of Taxes shall apply in all events, including where applicable law
does not permit the Company to close its taxable period on the Closing Date,
and the Sellers shall reimburse the Company to the extent that such Taxes
allocated to the Sellers exceed the provision therefor reflected in the Post-
Closing Statement and Buyer shall cause the Company to reimburse the Sellers
to the extent that any Taxes allocated hereunder to the Sellers are less than
the provision therefor reflected in the Post-Closing Statement. For purposes
of this section, Taxes for the period up to and including the Closing Date
will be determined on the basis of an interim closing of the books of the
Company. If reasonably requested by AWW, Buyer will cause a duly authorized
officer of the Company (or any successors) timely to execute and file the
Sellers\' Returns as prepared by AWW. Buyer shall promptly notify AWW
following receipt of any notice of audit or other proceeding relating to any
of the Seller\'s Returns or any other federal, state, foreign or local
corporation income or franchise tax return of the Company filed on or before
the Closing Date (together with all of the Seller\'s Returns, the "Prior
Period Returns"). AWW shall have the right to control any and all audits or
other proceedings relating to any Prior Period Return, including the filing
of an amended return or claim for refund; provided, however, that AWW shall
not agree to the resolution of any audit or other proceeding relating to any
Prior Period Return or file an amended Prior Period Return or refund claim
that would have any Material Adverse Effect on the Company without Buyer\'s
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall make
available or shall cause the Company to make available to AWW any and all
books and records of the Company and other documents requested by AWW and
shall make available employees of the Company reasonably necessary to enable
AWW to defend any audit or other proceeding or to prosecute any refund claim
with respect to any Prior Period Return and shall cooperate with AWW, at
their expense, in defense of such audits or refund claims. Buyer shall cause
the Company to file any and all other tax returns of the Company, which are
not Seller\'s Returns and which are to be filed after the Closing Date
("Buyer\'s Returns"). Buyer shall cause the Company to pay to AWW the amount
of any refund, credit or offset (including any interest paid or credited or
any offset allowed with respect thereto but reduced by any Taxes that the
Buyer or the Company shall be required to pay with respect thereto) received
or used, in the case of a credit or offset, by the Buyer or the Company of
Taxes relating to the Prior Period Returns. Buyer and the Company shall elect
not to carry back any Tax losses of the Company arising in a Buyer\'s Return
to any Tax period included in a Prior Period Return.   34    (b) The
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall (a) each provide the
other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by either of them
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any Taxing Authority or any judicial or
administrative proceeding with respect to Taxes; (b) each provide the other
or its representatives with any records or other information which may be
relevant to such return, audit, examination or proceeding, and (c) each
provide the other with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding or determination that affects any amount required to
be shown on any Tax Return of the other for any period (which shall be
maintained confidentially). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other, shall retain, until
the applicable statutes of limitations (including all extensions) have
expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting workpapers, and other books
and records or information which may be relevant to such returns for all Tax
periods or portions thereof ending before or including the Closing Date, and
shall not destroy or dispose of such records or information without first
providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy
the same. Any information obtained under this Section 5.13(b) shall be kept
confidential, except as otherwise may be necessary in conjunction with the
filing of any Tax Return, claims for refunds or conducting an audit or other
proceeding.   (c) Following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company to, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
affiliates from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Company for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date, (ii) all liability for Taxes
attributable to a Buyer Tax Act (as defined below) or to a breach by the
Buyer of any representation, warranty or covenant with respect to Taxes under
this Agreement, and (iii) all liability for Taxes of the Company to the
extent of the accrual, if any, established therefor in the Post-Closing
Statement. "Buyer Tax Act" means any action taken after the Closing Date by
the Buyer, any of its affiliates (including the Company), or any transferee
of the Buyer or any of its affiliates (other than any such action expressly
required by applicable law or by this Agreement) which causes a liability for
Taxes. The Sellers\' rights to indemnification set forth in this Section
5.13(c) shall be in addition to the indemnification rights set forth in
Article 8 and shall not be subject to limitations set forth in such Article
8.   (d) Following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless (i) the Buyer and its affiliates
from all liability for (A) Taxes of the Company for any taxable period ending
prior to or on the Closing Date and (B) any Taxes of the Company described
in Section 5.13(a) that are attributable to any taxable period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date for the period up to and including
the Closing Date and (ii) each of Buyer\'s officers from any liability of
such officer resulting from such officer\'s signing any of the Sellers\'
Returns pursuant to Section 5.13(a) unless and to the extent such Sellers\'
Returns reflect information provided by Buyer. Buyer\'s right to
indemnification set forth in this Section 5.13(d) shall be in addition to the
indemnification rights set forth in Article 8 and shall not be subject to
limitations set forth in such Article 8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers shall not indemnify and hold harmless any of the Buyer, its
affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from
any liability for Taxes attributable to Taxes of the Company to the extent of
the accrual, if any, established therefore or for a Buyer Tax Act. Estimated
Taxes paid by or on behalf of the Companies and their Subsidiaries on or
prior to the Closing Date shall be credited to Taxes with respect to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period. The Seller\'s responsibility under this Section 5.13(d)
to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company) against, or to pay or cause to be paid, any  
35   Taxes shall not include any such responsibility with respect to any
Taxes collected or withheld by the Company, if any (including, without
limitation, all sales and use taxes and all withholding or employment taxes)
with respect to events occurring through the Closing Date, the proceeds of
which are held by the Company on the Closing Date.   5.14. Intercompany
Payables and Receivables. As of the Closing Date, AWW shall cause all
outstanding intercompany payables and receivables of the Company outstanding
on the Closing Date owing to or from any of their Affiliates to be
eliminated, except for (i) the AWCC Debt and (ii) outstanding intercompany
payables and receivables of the Company owing to or from the entities being
sold pursuant to the Related Purchase Agreements.   5.15. Post-Closing
Access to Information. At all times after the Closing Date, each party will
permit the others and its representatives (including its counsel and
auditors) upon written notice and during normal business hours, to have
reasonable access to and examine and make copies, at the expense of
the copying party, of all books, records, files and documents in its
possession which relate to the conduct of the Company\'s business prior to
the Closing Date.   5.16. Disclosure Schedules. As promptly as practicable,
the Sellers will provide Buyer with a supplement or amendment to the
Schedules hereto with respect to any matter, condition or occurrence which is
required to be set forth or described in the Schedules. For the avoidance of
doubt, a matter, condition or occurrence shall only be "required" to be set
forth or described in the Schedules if the failure to be so disclosed would
result in a breach of the applicable representation or warranty (qualified by
materiality or Material Adverse Effect where applicable) on the date hereof
or on the Closing Date. In addition, the Sellers shall have the right at any
time and from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the
Schedules. The Sellers may provide Disclosure Schedules with respect to any
representation or warranty of this Agreement whether or not a specific
schedule is referred to therein. In the event that any supplement or
amendment of such Schedules shall be provided later than five (5) business
days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have the right to delay the
Closing for a period of five (5) business days in order for Buyer to review
such supplement or amendment. No such supplement or amendment shall be deemed
to cure any breach of or alter any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement unless Buyer specifically agrees thereto in writing. The Sellers
shall promptly inform Buyer, and Buyer will promptly inform the Sellers of
any fact or event which comes to their attention, the existence of which
constitutes or likely will constitute a breach in any material respects of
any representation or warranty in this Agreement.   5.17. Corporate Name.
Buyer shall not acquire, nor shall the Company retain, any rights to the
names "Connecticut-American Water Company," "American," "American Water," or
"American Water Works" (or any variations thereof) or any trademarks, trade
names or symbols related thereto. As soon as practicable after the Closing
(and in any event, no later than the 90th day thereafter), Buyer will cause
the Company to amend its organizational documents to the extent necessary to
remove the "Connecticut-American Water Company" name (and any variations
thereof) from the name of the Company and to remove all trademarks, trade
names and symbols related to the names "Connecticut-American Water Company,"
"American," "American Water," or "American Water Works" (or any variations
thereof) from the properties and assets (including all signs) of the
Company.   36    5.18. Negotiations. Neither the Sellers nor any Person
controlled by the Sellers under common control with the Sellers (each such
Person being a "Section 5.19 Affiliate"), nor any officer, director,
employee, representative or agent of the Seller or any of their Section 5.19
Affiliates, shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate or participate
in any way in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information or
assistance to, or enter into an agreement with any Person or group of Persons
(other than Buyer or any Person controlled by Buyer or under common control
with Buyer or any Persons providing financing to the parties hereto in
connection with facilitating the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) concerning any acquisition, merger,
consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, disposition or other transactions
(or series of such transactions) that would (a) result in the transfer to any
such Person or group of Persons of any of the Shares or substantially all of
the Company\'s properties or assets or (b) prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   5.19. Maintenance of Books
and Records. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate fully with each other
after the Closing so that (subject to any limitations that are reasonably
required to preserve any applicable attorney-client privilege) each party has
access to the business records, contracts and other information existing at
the Closing Date and relating in any manner to the Company or the conduct of
the Company\'s business (whether in the possession of the Sellers or Buyer).
No files, books or records existing at the Closing Date and relating in any
manner to the Company or the conduct of the Company\'s business shall be
destroyed by any party for a period of six years after the Closing Date
without giving the other party at least 30 days\' prior written notice,
during which time such other party shall have the right (subject to the
provisions hereof) to examine and to remove any such files, books and records
prior to their destruction. The access to files, books and records
contemplated by this Section 5.20 shall be during normal business hours and
upon not less than two (2) business days\' prior written request, shall be
subject to such reasonable limitations as the party having custody or control
thereof may impose to preserve the confidentiality of information contained
therein, and shall not extend to material subject to a claim of privilege
unless expressly waived by the party entitled to claim the same.   5.20.
Call Center Closing. In view of (a) the Buyer\'s currently operating customer
service facilities serving the same functions as the Sellers\' customer
service centers in New York and Massachusetts (the "Call Centers") and (b)
the Sellers\' previously announced intention to close the Call Centers, the
parties agree that the Sellers shall undertake to have the Call
Centers closed effective at the close of business on the day before the
Closing Date. The Sellers and Buyer agree to work together to coordinate this
closing in such a manner as to minimize the disruptive impact on customers
and employees of the Company.   5.21. WARN.   (a) Neither the Sellers nor
the Company shall, at any time within the 90-day period prior to the Closing
Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as
amended, ("WARN") or any state law, affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee of the Sellers without
notifying Buyer in advance and without complying with the notice requirements
and all other provisions of WARN and any similar state law.   37    (b)
Buyer agrees that between the Closing Date and a period ninety (90) calendar
days thereafter it will comply with WARN in all respects and, with respect to
the Company, not effect a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in WARN without complying with the notice requirements and all other
provisions of WARN and any applicable state law.   ARTICLE VI 
CONDITIONS   6.1. Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligations. All obligations
of each party to consummate the transactions are subject to satisfaction (or
waiver in writing, where permissible, by the party to which the condition
relates) at or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following
conditions:   (a) Governmental Approvals. Any waiting period applicable to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have expired
or been terminated and all consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers
and amendments from any governmental authority which are necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby set forth on
Schedule 3.3(c) and Schedule 4.3 shall have been obtained. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) the waiting period under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall have expired
or terminated without the imposition of any restrictions or conditions by
the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice

Material Adverse Effect on the Company or either of the parties.   (b) No

promulgated, enforced or issued by any governmental authority or other legal

7.1. Termination of Agreement.   (a) Subject to the provisions of Section
7.2, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:   (i) by mutual
written consent of the Sellers and Buyer; or   (ii) by either the Sellers or
Buyer, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to December 31, 2002;
provided, however, that this right of termination shall not be available to
any party whose material breach has caused the failure of the consummation of
the Agreement by such date;   (iii) by the Sellers or Buyer if any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment; provided, however, that this right of termination shall not be
available to any party whose material breach has caused such conditions to be
incapable of fulfillment;   (iv) by Buyer if any of the conditions set forth
in Section 6.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have
been waived by Buyer; provided, however, that this right of termination shall
not be available to Buyer if Buyer\'s material breach has caused such
conditions to be incapable of fulfillment; or   (v) by the Sellers if any
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by the Sellers; provided,
however, that this right of termination shall not be available to the Sellers
if the Sellers\' material breach has caused such conditions to be incapable
of fulfillment.   40    (b) In the event of termination by the Sellers or
Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be
given to the other and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be terminated, without further action by any party. If the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein:   (i)
Buyer shall return all documents and other material received from the Sellers
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before
or after the execution hereof, to the Sellers; and   (ii) all confidential
information received by Buyer with respect to the business of the Sellers and
the Company shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the
termination of this Agreement.   7.2. Effect of Termination. If this
Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are
abandoned as described in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become null and
void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of
Sections 5.4, 5.9 and this Article 7. Nothing in this Section 7.2 shall be
deemed to release any party from any liability for any breach by such party
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any
party to compel specific performance by any other party of its obligations
under this Agreement.   7.3. Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and
in the certificates delivered pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 shall
terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing, except that the
representations contained in Section 3.6 and the related indemnity
obligations contained in Article 8 shall terminate on, and no action or claim
with respect thereto may be brought following the expiration of, the
applicable statute of limitations (or extensions or waivers thereof). The
covenants to be performed prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement
shall terminate upon the Closing. All other covenants shall survive the
Closing and remain in effect indefinitely.   ARTICLE VIII 
INDEMNIFICATION   8.1. Indemnification by the Sellers.   (a) Subject to
the limitations contained in this Article 8, after the Closing, the Sellers,
jointly and severally, hereby agree to indemnify Buyer and its respective
officers, directors and Affiliates against and hold them harmless from and
against any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Sellers or
the Company in this Agreement or in any document or certificate required to
be furnished to Buyer by any of the Sellers or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement (including the Transaction Documents).   (b) Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that the Sellers shall not have any liability under any provision
of this Agreement for any Damages to the extent that such Damages relate to
actions taken by or omitted to be taken by Buyer or the Company after the
Closing Date.   41    (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Damages" shall
mean any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, damages (including costs
of investigation, clean-up and remediation), deficiencies, interest, costs
and expenses and any claims, actions, demands, causes of action, judgments,
costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and all
other reasonable expense incurred in investigating, preparing or defending
any litigation or proceeding, commenced or threatened, incident to the
successful enforcement of this Agreement). Damages shall not include the loss
of profits of the party seeking indemnification, or punitive damages unless
the party seeking indemnification has had punitive damages assessed or
asserted against it.   (d) Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise to Damages, including incurring
costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives
rise to such Damages.   8.2. Indemnification by Buyer.   (a) Subject to
the limitations contained in this Article 8, after the Closing, Buyer hereby
agrees to indemnify the Sellers and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates against and hold them harmless from any Damages suffered or
incurred by any such indemnified party (i) as a direct consequence of (A) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement
or in the certificates delivered to the Sellers pursuant to Section 6, (B)
any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (C) any
obligation or liability of the Company regardless of when such obligation or
liability arose to the extent such liability or obligation does not give rise
to a claim against the Sellers under Section 8.1(a), and (D) any claim,
proceeding or suit brought against AWW or GWS under WARN or any other local,
state, Federal or foreign law, which relates to actions taken by Buyer or the
Company at any time after the Closing with regard to the employment of the
Company\'s employees or (ii) arising out of or otherwise in respect of: (A)
termination by the Buyer or the Company of any Employee of the Company at any
time after the Closing; (B) failure of Buyer or the Company to comply with
its obligations under Section 5.10(a) hereof; (C) failure of Buyer or, after
the Closing, the Company to comply with its obligations including, but not
limited to, any statutory bargaining obligations, with respect to or under
the Collective Bargaining Agreements or the MOA; (D) liability on the part of
either Seller or any of their Affiliates resulting from any failure of Buyer
to obtain the consent of the Union to the substitution of Buyer\'s
compensation and employee benefit plans for the Sellers\' compensation and
employee benefit plans, or (E) any claim by any Employee of the Company for
severance pay on account of this Agreement (except for employees terminated
or laid off as a result of the actions contemplated by Section 5.20).   (b)
The Sellers shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any
Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise to Damages, including incurring costs only to the
minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to such
Damages.   8.3. Limitations. The Sellers shall not be liable under Sections
8.1 for Damages thereunder unless the aggregate of all Damages, for which the
Sellers would (but for this Section 8.3) be liable, together with all other
claims for Damages under Section 8.1 of each of the    42   Related
Purchase Agreements, exceeds on a cumulative basis $1,000,000 (the "Threshold
Amount"), and then only to the extent of any such aggregate excess and in no
event shall the liability of the Sellers under Section 8.1 of this Agreement
and the Related Purchase Agreements exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate (the
"Ceiling").   8.4. Other Limitations. From and after the Closing, no claim
for indemnity shall be made by either Buyer or the Sellers if such claim is
based on or related to (a) an event or facts disclosed to such party in
writing prior to the Closing or of which the party seeking indemnification
otherwise was aware prior to the Closing, or (b) to the extent and in the
dollar amount such matter is reflected in the Post-Closing Statement.  
8.5. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto, (i) pursuant to Sections 8.1(a) and 8.2(a)(i), shall
terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant
to Section 7.3, and (ii) pursuant to the other clauses of Sections 8.1 and
8.2, shall not terminate; provided, however, that as to clauses (i) and (ii)
above such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate
with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified shall have,
before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by
delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to
the party providing the indemnification; provided, further that any such
claim shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and waived eighteen (18) months
after being made, unless (A) court proceedings shall have been commenced with
respect to such claim within such 18-month period, or (B) such claim shall
have been waived or satisfied within such 18-month period.   8.6. Procedures
Relating to Indemnification.   (a) A party seeking indemnification pursuant
to this Article 8 (an "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written notice
to the party from whom such indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the assertion of any claim, the incurrence of any Damages, or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding of which it has knowledge and
in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a "Third Party
Claim"), and will give the Indemnifying Party such information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give
such required notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual
prejudice thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) business days after the Indemnified
Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written
notice to the Indemnified Party after receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of or assertion of any claim or action, suit or
proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim which involves
(and continues to involve) solely monetary damages using counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, that (A) the Indemnifying
Party expressly agrees in such notice that, as between the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party, solely the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated
to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim, (B) such Third Party Claim
does not include a request or demand for injunctive or other equitable relief
and (C) the Indemnifying Party makes reasonably adequate provision to assure
the Indemnified Party of the ability of the Indemnifying Party to satisfy the
full amount of any    43   adverse monetary judgment that is reasonably
likely to result. The Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have satisfied
the condition set forth in clause (C) of the preceding sentence if it is a
regulated utility. Should the Indemnifying Party elect to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.6, the Indemnifying Party
will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof.  
(b) Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (c) The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in
(but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim
which the other party is defending as provided in this Agreement.   (d) The
Indemnifying Party, if it shall have assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, shall have the right, upon 30 days
prior written notice to the Indemnified Party, to consent to the entry of
judgment with respect to, or otherwise settle such Third Party Claim.   (e)
In the event of any indemnification claim under this Article 8 involving a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully (and shall
cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully) with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any such claim under this Article 8. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall furnish
the Indemnifying Party with such documentary or other evidence as is then in
its or any of its Affiliates\' possession as may reasonably be requested by
the Indemnifying Party for the purpose of defending against any such
claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute
any claim involving a third party, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal
business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable
retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection therewith.   (f) The parties acknowledge that Buyer
(and the other Persons for which they can claim indemnity hereunder) shall be
entitled to indemnification for Damages in respect of intentional and willful
breaches of covenants or agreements in this Agreement irrespective of the
Threshold Amount or the Ceiling (it being understood that the failure to cure
a breach shall not, by itself, be an intentional and willful breach).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 8, Buyer (or the
other Persons for which they can claim indemnification) shall be entitled to
indemnification for Damages in respect of a breach of Section 3.2 and 3.6
irrespective of the Threshold Amount or the Ceiling.   (g) Each of the
parties hereto agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing
with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Company,
the     44   events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein or contemplated hereby, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article 8. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, as a material inducement to the other
parties hereto entering into this Agreement, Buyer hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, any claim or cause of action, known and unknown, foreseen
and unforeseen, which it or any of its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company) may have against the other parties hereto, including
without limitation under the common law or federal or state securities laws,
trade regulation laws or other laws (including CERCLA and any other
Environmental Laws), by reason of this Agreement, the events giving rise to
this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein or contemplated
hereby or thereby, except for claims or causes of action brought under and
subject to the terms and conditions of the indemnification provisions
contained in this Article 8.   (h) Indemnification for any claim under this
Article 8 shall not be available to any Indemnified Party unless such
Indemnified Party, if requested to do so by the Indemnifying Party, first
seeks recovery from any Collateral Source for such claim before making any
claim for indemnification by the Indemnifying Party; provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in seeking such recovery from such Collateral Source. Any
Indemnifying Party may, in its sole discretion, require any Indemnified Party
to grant an assignment of the right of such Indemnified Party to assert a
claim against any Collateral Source if the Indemnifying Party has first fully
satisfied the claim by the Indemnified Party. In the event of such
assignment, the Indemnifying Party will pursue such claim at its own
expense.   (i) No right to indemnification under this Article 8 shall
be limited by reason of any investigation or audit, conducted before or after
the Closing, of any party hereto including, without limitation, the knowledge
of such party of any breach of any representation, warranty, agreement
or covenant by the other party at any time, or the decision by such party
to complete the Closing provided that such party has informed the breaching
party of its desire to preserve its rights in respect of such breach despite
the Closing and the Indemnifying Party has waived in writing Section
8.4(a) hereof.   (j) No party shall have any liability to another party
under this Article 8 for Damages (and no cost or expense relating to such
Damages shall be included in determining the extent of Damages incurred by
such party for purposes of Section 8.3) to the extent that:   (A) the
Indemnified Party recovers insurance proceeds covering  the Damages or
otherwise recovers payments in respect of such  Damages from any other source
(whether in a lump sum or stream of  payments); or   (B) the Indemnified
Party\'s Tax liability is actually  reduced as a result of a tax benefit to
which the Indemnified Party  becomes entitled in respect of the Damages.  
(k) Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to give timely
and effective written notice to the appropriate insurance carrier(s) of any
occurrence or circumstances which, in the judgment of Buyer consistent with
its customary risk management practices, appear likely to give rise to
a claim against Buyer that is likely to involve one or more insurance
policies of Buyer. Any such notice shall be given in good faith by Buyer
without regard to the possibility   45   of indemnification payments by
the Sellers under this Article 8, and shall be processed by Buyer in good
faith and in a manner consistent with its risk management practices involving
claims for which no third party contractual indemnification is available.  
(l) If at any time subsequent to the receipt by an Indemnified Party of an
indemnity payment hereunder, such Indemnified Party (or any
Affiliate thereof) receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment
with respect to the Damages for which it received such indemnity payment
(including insurance proceeds and other payments pursuant to Section
8.6(h)(A) and a tax benefit pursuant to Section 8.6(h)(B)) (the "Recovery"),
such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to the amount of such Recovery, less any expense incurred by such
Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) in connection with such Recovery, but
in no event shall any such payment exceed the amount of such indemnity
payment.   ARTICLE IX  MISCELLANEOUS   9.1. Entire Agreement. This
Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, Schedules, exhibits

been contained herein. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived

Sellers, in the case of compliance by Buyer, with any term or provision of
this Agreement that the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, was or is obligated to perform or comply with, by a written instrument
duly executed by Buyer or the Sellers. The failure of any party at any time
or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner
affect the right of such party at a later time to enforce the same or any
other provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of the
breach of any provision of this Agreement in one or more instances shall
operate or be construed as a waiver of any other condition or subsequent
breach.   9.3. Interpretation. Unless the context of this Agreement

any party, regardless of which party was generally responsible for the
