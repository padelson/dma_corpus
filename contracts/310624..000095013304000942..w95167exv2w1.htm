be continuing (and shall not have been waived by the Merger Sub), the Merger
Sub shall, and the Parent shall cause the Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 of the Exchange Act (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.9(a)(ii)))
the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The
obligation of the Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for the Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction of the
condition that there be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which represents at least a
majority of the then outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis (taking into
account all Shares issued and outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer and
all additional Shares that would be issued and outstanding if all vested
options, warrants or rights to purchase Shares at a price per Share less than
the Offer Consideration were exercised) (the &#147;<U>Minimum
Condition</U>&#148;) and to the satisfaction or waiver by the Merger Sub of
the other conditions set forth in Annex A (the Minimum Condition and the

the Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. The Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right to waive in whole or in part any of the Offer Conditions (other than the
Minimum Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to
make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that no change may be made without the prior
written consent of the Company which decreases the price per Share payable in

changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, imposes conditions
to the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex A, waives or
changes the Minimum Condition or makes any other change in the terms and
conditions of the Offer that is in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares
or, except as provided below, extends the Offer. Subject to the
terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction of the Minimum
Condition and the satisfaction or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the
Offer set forth in Annex A as of any expiration date of the Offer, the Merger
Sub shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is

such purposes the day the Offer is commenced as the first day of such period),
and the Offer shall be extended until such time as the Offer Conditions are

then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of
the Merger Sub, promptly increase the size of its Board of Directors or
exercise its reasonable commercial efforts to secure the resignations of such

&#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;) to receive in trust, the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.6(a). At the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit the Merger
Consideration with the Paying Agent. The Merger Consideration shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. If for any reason (including losses) the funds held by the Paying
Agent are inadequate to pay the amounts to which the Stockholders shall be
entitled under Section&nbsp;2.6(a), the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall

the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the
&#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148; or individually, a
&#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;), whose Shares were converted pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.6(a) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to a Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify) and instructions for effecting
the surrender of a Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration for the
Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably
required by the Parent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive promptly
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced
thereby, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall (i)&nbsp;have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or (ii)&nbsp;have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or that payment of Taxes is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.7, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share in cash as
contemplated by Section&nbsp;2.6.

statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which (i)&nbsp;is in effect and (ii)
has the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger (which illegality or prohibition would have a
material impact on the Parent and its Subsidiaries, on a combined basis with
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, if the Merger were
consummated notwithstanding such statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or other order).

pursuant to the Offer in violation of the terms of the Offer or this Agreement.

provided in this Article&nbsp;VII, there shall be no other conditions to the Merger,
including any financing contingency. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the existence or possible existence of any post-closing adjustment
to the purchase price payable in the DIG Purchase Agreement, any Objection (as
defined in the DIG Purchase Agreement) or pendency or resolution of any dispute
under Section&nbsp;2.8 of the DIG Purchase Agreement or any issue pertaining to the
Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in the DIG Purchase Agreement) shall not in
any way impact, hinder, prevent or otherwise delay the Parent&#146;s or the Merger
Sub&#146;s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.
