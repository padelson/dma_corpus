AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of March 10, 2004, by and among CGI Group Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the province of Quebec (the " _Parent_ "), CGI Virginia Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Merger Sub_ "), and American Management Systems, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").   

RECITALS    

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders that the Parent and the Company consummate the business combination and other transactions provided for herein;   

 WHEREAS, it is intended that the business combination be accomplished upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, by the Merger Sub commencing a cash tender offer (as such offer may be amended from time to time, the " _Offer_ ") for all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer are hereinafter referred to as the " _Shares_ ") in an amount of $19.40 per Share (the " _Offer Consideration_ ") to be followed by the Merger (as defined in Section 2.1);   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company have approved the Offer and have declared the advisability of, adopted and approved, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _DGCL_ "), this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;   

 WHEREAS, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares in the Offer, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger;   

 WHEREAS, the Parent, as the sole stockholder of the Merger Sub, has approved the Offer and, immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, will approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger;   

 WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition to the Parents and the Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain officers and directors of the Company are entering into separate voting agreements (the " _Stockholder Tender and Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which such individuals are agreeing, among other things, to tender their Shares in the Offer and to grant the Parent a proxy to vote their respective shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; and    ##### 

  

  

 WHEREAS, the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Offer and the Merger.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE OFFER    

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_.   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated and none of the events set forth in Section (a) through (i) of Annex A attached hereto and made a part hereof (" _Annex A_ ") shall have occurred and be continuing (and shall not have been waived by the Merger Sub), the Merger Sub shall, and the Parent shall cause the Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 2.9(a)(ii))) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The obligation of the Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction of the condition that there be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares which represents at least a majority of the then outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis (taking into account all Shares issued and outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer and all additional Shares that would be issued and outstanding if all vested options, warrants or rights to purchase Shares at a price per Share less than the Offer Consideration were exercised) (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and to the satisfaction or waiver by the Merger Sub of the other conditions set forth in Annex A (the Minimum Condition and the conditions set forth in Annex A collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(a)) will be tendered to the Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. The Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive in whole or in part any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no change may be made without the prior written consent of the Company which decreases the price per Share payable in the Offer, reduces the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in Annex A, waives or changes the Minimum Condition or makes any other change in the terms and conditions of the Offer that is in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or, except as provided below, extends the Offer. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex A as of any expiration date of the Offer, the Merger Sub shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is    ##### 

  

  

permitted to do so under applicable Legal Requirements (as defined in Section
3.2(d)). The scheduled expiration date of the Offer shall initially be 20
Business Days (as defined in Section 9.3(e)) following the date of
commencement of the Offer (counting for such purposes the day the Offer is
commenced as the first day of such period), and the Offer shall be extended
until such time as the Offer Conditions are satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by this Agreement, waived; provided, however, that the scheduled
expiration date of the Offer shall not be extended  _beyond 75 calendar days
following the date of commencement of the Offer_ (counting for such purposes
the day the Offer is commenced as the first day of such period) without the
mutual written consent of the Company and the Merger Sub (such date as may be
so extended, the " _Outside Offer Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the
staff thereof or the Nasdaq National Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the
Offer (but in no event beyond the Outside Offer Date) or (ii) provide for one
or more " _subsequent offering periods_ " of up to an additional 20 Business
Days in the aggregate in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall not terminate the
Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date (as the same may be extended or
required to be extended) without the written consent of the Company except in
the event that Parent and Merger Sub terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1. At the time that the Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for
payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to the Merger Sub the funds necessary to pay for all
Shares that the Merger Sub becomes so obligated to accept for payment and pay
for pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Consideration shall, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes (as defined in Section 9.3(h)), be net to the
seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer.   

 (b) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, the Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Parent and the Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Parent and the Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Merger Sub will cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws and the DGCL. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule TO before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Parent and the Merger Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Parent or the Merger Sub or either of their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the    ##### 

  

  

Schedule TO promptly after the receipt of such comments and to consult
with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments
(and provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any such written
response and telephonic notification of any such verbal response). If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Merger Sub, the Parent and the Merger
Sub shall promptly use their respective best efforts to cause the Paying
Agent to cause all tendered Shares to be returned to the registered holders
of the Shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered to
the Paying Agent (as defined in Section 2.7(a)).   

 Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.   

 (a) The Company represents and warrants that the Companys Board of Directors, by resolutions adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting of all directors called, has duly (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) declared the advisability of, approved and adopted this Agreement and approved and adopted the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iii) approved the Stockholder Tender and Voting Agreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that (A) the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Merger Sub thereunder and, if required by Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and (B) this Agreement be submitted to the Companys stockholders for adoption at the Company Stockholder Meeting (as defined in Section 2.9(a)(i)) to the extent required under the DGCL. Subject to Section 6.1(e), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors described in this Section 1.2(a).   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") which shall contain the recommendation referred to in clause (iv) of Section 1.2(a) hereof (subject to Section 6.1(e)). The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and each of the Parent and the Merger Sub, on the other hand, will promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company will cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company agrees to provide the Parent, the Merger Sub and their counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and to consult with the Parent, the Merger Sub and their counsel prior to responding to any such comments (and provide the Parent, the Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of any such written response and telephonic notification of any such verbal response).    ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Company shall promptly furnish the Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares to the extent in possession of the Company or the transfer agent for the Shares. The Company shall furnish the Merger Sub with such additional information, including updated listings and computer files of the stockholders of the Company, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as the Parent, the Merger Sub or their Representatives (as defined in Section 6.1(a)) may reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, the Parent and the Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated or if the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly destroy, or cause to be destroyed, or deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Company all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the possession of their Representatives and shall certify in writing to the Company their compliance with this Section 1.2(c).   

 Section 1.3 _Directors of the Company_.   

 (a) Subject to compliance with applicable law, promptly upon the purchase of and payment for a number of Shares that satisfies the Minimum Condition by the Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer, the Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as is equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of directors on such Board (after giving effect to the directors designated by the Parent pursuant to this sentence) by the percentage that the number of Shares so purchased and paid for bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of the Merger Sub, promptly increase the size of its Board of Directors or exercise its reasonable commercial efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors, or both, as is necessary to enable the Parents designees to be so elected or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors and, subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, shall cause the Parents designees to be so elected or appointed. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by the Parent, also cause directors designated by the Parent and the Merger Sub to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Companys Board of Directors of each Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parents designees are appointed or elected to the Companys Board of Directors hereunder, until the Effective Time the Company shall (and the Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Company to) have at least two members of the Companys Board of Directors who are directors on the date hereof and who are neither officers of the Company nor designees of the Parent and who are otherwise "independent    ##### 

  

  

directors" under applicable NASDAQ rules (the " _Independent Directors_ ");
provided, however, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced
below two for any reason whatsoever, the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to cause
the Person designated by the remaining Independent Director to be elected to
fill such vacancy, which person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director
for all purposes of this Agreement. If no Independent Directors then remain,
the other directors of the Company then in office shall designate two Persons
to fill such vacancies who will not be directors, officers, employees or
affiliates of the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company, and such persons
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement.   

 (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its stockholders together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable the Parents designees to be elected to the Companys Board of Directors. The Parent and the Merger Sub will supply the Company any information with respect to them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(b) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of the Merger Sub, the Parent or any of their respective affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.   

 (c) Following the election or appointment of the Parents designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2), the Companys Board of Directors shall include at least one Independent Director and the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to authorize any amendment of this Agreement or the Company Charter Documents (as defined in Section 3.1(b)), any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Merger Sub or the Parent, any waiver of any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder or any action as to which consent, agreement or action of the Company is required hereunder or in connection herewith; provided, however, if the foregoing provisions of this subsection are invalid or incapable of being enforced under applicable law, then neither the Parent nor the Merger Sub shall approve (either in its capacity as a stockholder or as a party to this Agreement, as applicable), and the Parent and the Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence of, such action unless such action shall have received the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not delegate any matter covered by this Section 1.3(c) to any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company unless such committee consists only of Independent Directors.    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II

Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ".   

 Section 2.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and the Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the " _Effective Time_ _"_ ) as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined in this Section 2.2). The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Holland and Knight LLP, 1600 Tysons Boulevard, McLean, Virginia 22102, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").   

 Section 2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.   

 Section 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Subject to Section 6.8, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such certificate of incorporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is American Management Systems, Incorporated"; and provided further, any provisions relating to the incorporator or initial directors shall be eliminated. Subject to Section 6.8, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of the Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such Bylaws.   

 Section 2.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the    ##### 

  

  

Effective Time shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation from
and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly
appointed.   

 Section 2.6 _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the parties or the holders of any Shares of the Company:   

 (a) Each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.6(c) and the Dissenting Shares) automatically shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.7, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.7. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) shall be made net of applicable withholding taxes in accordance with Section 2.7(f) to the extent that such withholding is required by applicable Legal Requirements.

 Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall designate an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Shares (other than the Shares held by the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries) in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive in trust, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(a). At the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit the Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent. The Merger Consideration shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. If for any reason (including losses) the funds held by the Paying Agent are inadequate to pay the amounts to which the Stockholders shall be entitled under Section 2.6(a), the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for the payment thereof.   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ " or individually, a " _Certificate_ "), whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.6(a) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify) and instructions for effecting the surrender of a Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration for the Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably required by the Parent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced thereby, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall (i) have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (ii) have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or that payment of Taxes is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.7, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share in cash as contemplated by Section 2.6.    ##### 

  

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares, which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.   

 (d) At any time following the six month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent, and holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 (e) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article II, provided, that the Person to whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct or otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Shares represented by the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

 (f) The Parent, the Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Offer Consideration or the Merger Consideration payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger any or all such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and/or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares to which such consideration would otherwise have been paid.   

 Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares_.    ##### 

  

  

 (a) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a Company stockholder who (A) has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger; (B) shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such shares in the manner provided for in Section 262 of the DGCL; and (C) shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ , however, that (1) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish such holders entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL; (2) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares or lost his right to appraisal and payment for his Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL; or (3) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time provided for the filing of such petition in Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.7 of this Agreement, of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares.   

 (b) The Company shall give the Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company; and (B) the opportunity to lead all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL (it being understood that the Company shall be entitled to participate therein). The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 (iii) the Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC and shall file a definitive form of the Proxy/Information Statement, which shall reflect compliance with or resolution of the comments and requests in accordance with the Exchange Act from the SEC as the Company and the Parent shall deem appropriate;   

 (iv) the Company shall distribute the Proxy/Information Statement to the Companys stockholders in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements; and   

 (v) subject to Section 6.1(e), the Company shall take all such other reasonable action necessary or appropriate to obtain the lawful approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders including, to the extent necessary or advisable, soliciting from holders of Shares proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) the Company agrees that its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock, as required by this Section 2.9, shall not be affected by a Change of Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 6.1(e)); and (B) the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer.   

 (b) The Parent and the Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all information concerning the Parent, the Merger Sub and their affiliates required by the Exchange Act or as otherwise required by the SEC to be set forth in the Proxy/Information Statement.   

 (c) Each of the Company and the Parent shall consult and confer with the other and the others counsel regarding the Proxy/Information Statement and each shall have the opportunity to comment on the Proxy/Information Statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, before the Proxy/Information Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the Companys stockholders.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS    

 Section 6.1 _Acquisition Proposals_.   

 (a) _No Solicitation_. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, advisors, agents, accountants, consultants, employees, investment bankers and legal counsel (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.1(g)(i)); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except as to the existence of these provisions; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 6.1(e)); or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any transaction contemplated thereby.

The Company shall promptly request that each person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with respect to such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy (which destruction the Company shall request be certified in writing by such person) all confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to such person or any of its affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives.   

 (b) _Notification Of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_.   

 (i) As promptly as practicable after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide the Parent with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

other comparable materials providing for the terms of the
Acquisition Proposal received from the Person or group making the Acquisition
Proposal (including any amendments thereto).   

 (ii) The Company shall provide the Parent with 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors is reasonably expected to discuss or consider any Acquisition Proposal.   

 (c) _Superior Offers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.1(a), prior to the acceptance for payment and payment for Shares by the Merger Sub in the Offer, in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that its Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 6.1(g)(ii)), it may then take the following actions (but only (A) if and to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it is reasonably likely that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Legal Requirements and (B) after the Company has given written notice (" _Superior Offer Notice_ ") to the Parent that expressly states (1) that it has received a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Companys Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer; (2) that the Companys Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Legal Requirements; (3) the identity of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal; and (4) the nature of the action that the Company intends to take):   

 (i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that (A) it receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such third party on its behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.2(a)) and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to the Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously made available to Parent);   

 (ii) Engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal; and   

 (iii) Subject to compliance with Section 6.1(d), enter into definitive agreements with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) hereof.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) For a period of not less than three Business Days after the Parents receipt from the Company of each Superior Offer Notice, the Company shall, if requested by the Parent, negotiate in good faith with the Parent to revise this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Offer no longer constitutes a Superior Offer.   

 (e) _Changes of Recommendation_. Neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, modify or change, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or change, in a manner adverse to the Parent or to the Merger Sub, the Company Board of Directors recommendation that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Merger Sub thereunder and, if required by Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement and the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) in response to the receipt of a Superior Offer that has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Offer after the Companys compliance with Section 6.1(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, change or withdraw its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Merger Sub thereunder and, if required by Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement and the Merger; (B) in the case of a Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer; and (C) to the extent that the Companys Board of Directors concludes in good faith (following consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Legal Requirements, the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, change or withdraw its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the Merger Sub thereunder and, if required by the Legal Requirements, adopt this Agreement and the Merger (any of the foregoing actions in (A), (B) or (C), whether by a Board of Directors or a committee thereof, a " _Change of Company Recommendation_ "). In the case of (A) or (B), all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) shall be met:   

 (i) the Merger Sub shall not yet have accepted for payment and paid for the Shares pursuant to the Offer;   

 (ii) it shall have provided to the Parent written notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a Superior Offer; (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of the Person or group making the Superior Offer; and (3) that it intends to effect a Change of Company Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so;   

 (iii) the Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure of the Company Board of Directors to effect a Change of Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; and   

 (iv) it shall not have breached in any material respect any of the provisions set forth in this Section 6.1.    ##### 

  

  

 (f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors, in connection with a tender or exchange offer for the Companys outstanding securities by a third party, from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Companys Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_  that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.

 (c) _Notification_. Each of the Parent, the Merger Sub and the Company will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any applicable Legal Requirement.

 (a) _Treatment of Stock Options_.

(the aggregate amount payable under this Section 6.7(a), the "
_Option Consideration_ "), and (ii) obtain a release or other
documentation executed by the holder of each such Company Option, reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent and the Surviving Corporation, evidencing the
cancellation of such Company Option. The parties agree that the Company may
amend the Company Stock Option Plans and any applicable agreements as the
Company deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the Companys obligations
under this Section 6.7(a). The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the Option
Consideration such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Legal Requirement,
and the final sentence of Section 2.7(f) shall apply.   

 (b) _Treatment of Stock Option Plans_. Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) the payments or conversions into the right to receive cash set forth in Section 6.7(a) to extinguish all rights of participants under the Company Stock Option Plans and (ii) following the Effective Time such participant not to have any right thereunder to acquire equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.   

 (c) _Termination of the Company Purchase Plans_.

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) "Deferred Stock Units __" granted under the Company Stock Option Plans or any agreement between the Company and a current or former employee of the Company and outstanding, whether or not vested, immediately prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled as of the Effective Time, and (ii) the restrictions on each share of restricted stock granted under the Company Stock Option Plans or any agreement between the Company and a current or former employee of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Restricted Stock_ ") to expire as of the Effective Time, and the parties agree that each holder of Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Closing a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of Deferred Stock Units or shares of Restricted Stock, as the case may be, and (B) the Merger Consideration for a share of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time. The parties further agree that the Company may amend the Company Stock Option Plans and any applicable agreements as the Company deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the Companys obligations under this Section 6.7(d).    #####

 (f) _Change in Control_. The Parent acknowledges that each employee listed on Section 6.7(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall, upon the consummation of the Merger, be entitled to terminate employment with the Company and its Affiliates and that any such termination shall be deemed a "constructive termination" without Cause for purposes of the employment agreements or change in control agreements applicable to each such employee.   

 Section 6.8 _Indemnification_.   

 (a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, the Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any Covered Party (as hereinafter defined), subject to applicable Legal Requirements.

For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause, to be maintained in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof on terms comparable to those applicable under the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies) for a period of six years; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent annual premium would exceed 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the Parent shall cause or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage as is available for such 200% of such annual premium).   

 (c) _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 6.8 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Covered Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 6.8.   

 (d) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has    ##### 

  

  

been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the

an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement, the DIG Proceeds Loan, the other transactions and actions
contemplated hereby, and all actions taken in furtherance of any of the
foregoing), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Each
Covered Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, within ten
Business Days of receipt by the Parent from the Covered Party of a request
therefor;  _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification.   

 (e) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company.

All such taxes will be paid by the party bearing the legal responsibility for such payment.

The DIG Proceeds Loan shall be pursuant to a promissory note in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ ; provided,    ##### 

  

  

however, that in no event shall any term of the DIG Proceeds Loan require an
increase in the Offer Consideration or the Merger Consideration or other
amendment to any material term or condition of this Agreement or the Offer
Documents.

 Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in Section 6.8.

 Section 9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.

 Section 9.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_.   

 (a) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.   

 (b) _Specific Performance_. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

document.   

 Section 9.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 9.10 shall be void.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Sub reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or in part, to the Parent or to any affiliate of the Parent, the right to purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment will not relieve the Merger Sub of its obligations under the Offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.   

 Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.   

 (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware state court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware state court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal court, and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.   

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE    ##### 

  

  

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

likelihood of success;   

(b) there shall have been entered, enforced, enacted or deemed applicable
to (A) the Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company or (B) the Agreement, the

this Agreement and the expiration of the Offer (except to the extent that
such representations and warranties speak as of a specific date, in which
case as of such specific date);   

(d) the Company shall have breached any covenant, obligation or other
agreement to be performed or complied by it under the Agreement where such

ability to assume the control and provide for the orderly transition of
control of the business of the Company upon consummation of the Merger;   

(e) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;   

(f) any of the following shall have occurred since the date of this
Agreement and be continuing such that the consummation of the Offer and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are impracticable: (1) any
general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on
the Toronto Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, (2)
a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in
respect of banks in the United States or Canada (whether or not mandatory),

institutions in the United States or Canada, or (4) a commencement or, if
already commenced, a material worsening, of a war, armed hostilities or other
national or international calamity directly or indirectly involving the
United States or Canada or any terrorist activities which materially and
adversely affects the Parent or the Company or CACI International, Inc. and
DIG taken as a whole or (5) changes in legal or regulatory conditions to the
extent such changes have a material, adverse and disproportionate impact on
CACI International, Inc. relative to other business entities engaged in
substantially the same line or lines of business;
