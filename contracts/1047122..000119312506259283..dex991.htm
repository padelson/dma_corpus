estimates or reserves from the amounts in the Most Recent Balance Sheet, (ii)

changes in or adjustments to the estimates at completion included in the Most

on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, all estimates at completion,
contract profit rates, accounts requiring management estimates and loss or
other reserves associated with contracts in process listed in _Exhibit B_
attached hereto used in the preparation of the Most Recent Balance Sheet shall
be the same in the Statement of Estimated Net Selected Assets and in the

associated impacts on any other accounts that change based on a change in such
estimates at completion, contract profit rates, management estimates and loss
or other reserves shall be ignored. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
following items and changes shall be taken into account in preparing the
Statement of Estimated Net Selected Assets and the Statement of Closing Net
Selected Assets, and such items shall be the only items taken into account
for such purpose: (w) all amounts of any accrual or reserve account shall be
reduced for any cash payments with respect to such accrual or reserve account
after the Balance Sheet Date; (x) for those contracts or programs listed in
_Exhibit B_ attached hereto, estimates at completion, contract profit rates

Event, and only to the extent of the impact of that Third-Party Event as would

changes to the balances comprising the Net Selected Assets other than those in
clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph and clauses
(w), (x) and (y) of this sentence to the extent, and only to the extent, that
the changes reflect changes resulting from the operations of the Business,

receivables and the payment of payables, between the Balance Sheet Date and
the opening of business on the Closing Date.

(c) A " _Third-Party Event_ " is an event that (i) occurs between the close

Closing Date, (ii) is communicated to Parent, Target Company or Target
Subsidiary on or prior to the date thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
from a source outside the personnel, premises and operations of the Target
Companies and Target Subsidiaries, and (iii) states a claim or provides notice
of a condition, the financial statement effect of which is probable of
occurrence and reasonably stated or estimable, and would therefore require,
under GAAP, the revision, upward or downward, of a contract reserve or
estimate at completion in the absence of the other provisions of this 
_Section 2.5_. For the purposes of the previous sentence only, "communicated"
shall mean the receipt by Parent, Target Company or Target Subsidiary of a
written notice from a third-party customer, subcontractor or vendor or
a Governmental Entity. The intent of Buyer and Parent with regard to the



 

17 methodologies described above is to prohibit an adjustment to the Preliminary
Purchase Price with respect to changes in estimates at completion, levels of
reserves and/or views of risks, opportunities or judgments with respect to
agreements existing as of the Balance Sheet Date, except upon the occurrence
of a Third-Party Event.

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Parents calculation of the Closing Net Selected
Assets, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Hawker 1000 Inventory and/or Closing Net
Financing Receivables delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_, Buyer may,
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Statement of Closing
Net Selected Assets and Other Items, deliver a notice to Parent disagreeing
with any such calculation and setting forth Buyers calculation of such
amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall describe in reasonable detail
the specific nature and amount of each disagreement and shall state in
reasonable detail all bases upon which Buyer believes the Statement of Closing
Net Selected Assets and Other Items is not in conformity with the requirements
of _Section 2.5_. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items
and amounts contained in the Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and
Other Items delivered pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ which are not specifically
stated as a disagreement in the notice to Parent of any disagreements. If
Buyer shall fail to give Parent such notice of disagreement within such sixty
(60) day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with Parent as to the
Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and Other Items. Any disagreements
contained in a notice of disagreements delivered by Buyer to Parent pursuant
to this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 2.8_ below
through a single integrated process.

Section 2.7 _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

Section 2.8 _Resolution of Disagreements_.

(a) If any notice of disagreement shall be duly and timely delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ above, Buyer and Parent shall, from the time of
such delivery until the thirtieth (30th) day following the delivery of the
Statement of Closing Net Selected



 

18 Assets and Other Items pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ above, make good faith
efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts on the Statement
of Closing Net Selected Assets and Other Items. If, during such period, Buyer
and Parent are unable to reach agreement with respect to any such
disagreement(s), they shall within ten (10) business days after the end of
such period (A) jointly prepare and sign a statement (the " _Statement of
Disagreements_ ") setting forth (1) those disagreements (if any) that Buyer
and Parent have resolved and the resolution of such disagreements and (2)
those disagreements that Buyer and Parent did not resolve (the " _Unresolved
Disagreements_ ") and (B) engage a partner of an independent nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually selected by Buyer and Parent (the "
_Neutral Accountant_ ") to promptly commence a review of this Agreement and
the Unresolved Disagreements for the purpose of making a determination with
respect to the Unresolved Disagreements in accordance with the applicable
provisions of _Section 2.6(a)_. In making any such determinations, the
Neutral Accountant shall consider only the Unresolved Disagreements. In
resolving the Unresolved Disagreements, the Neutral Accountant shall accept
each of the amounts set forth on the Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets
and Other Items, unless Buyer demonstrates that such amounts are contrary to
the applicable requirements of the Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets
and Other Items set forth in _Section 2.6_. In the event Buyer is able to so
demonstrate, the Neutral Accountants resolution of each of the Unresolved
Disagreements shall consist of the determination of appropriate amounts for
each Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and Other Items item that is
the subject of the Unresolved Disagreements, which amounts shall be equal to
one of, or between, the amounts proposed by Parent in the Statement of Closing
Net Selected Assets and Other Items, and by Buyer in its notice of
disagreements. To the extent that it is determined by the Parties or by the
Neutral Accountant in accordance with this _Section 2.8(a)_ that the
Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and Other Items required
a reclassification of an account balance (or a portion thereof) from the
reclassification of such balance in the Most Recent Balance Sheet in order for
the Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and Other Items to be prepared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Target Net Selected Assets
(as defined below) shall also be adjusted with respect to the amount of the
related misclassification in the Most Recent Balance Sheet. The Neutral
Accountant shall deliver to Buyer and Parent, as promptly as practicable, a
report setting forth his or her determination(s), including a brief discussion
of the basis of the determination for each Unresolved Disagreement. Any such
report shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The Closing Net Selected
Assets, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Hawker 1000 Inventory and Closing Net
Receivables set forth in the Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and
Other Items, either as agreed to by Parent and Buyer if such statement is not
referred to the Neutral Accountant or as adjusted to include the final
determinations by the Neutral Accountant, shall be the " _Final Closing Net
Selected Assets_ ", the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ", the " _Final
Closing Hawker 1000 Inventory_ " and the " _Final Net Financing Receivables_
".

(b) The cost of any such review by and report of the Neutral Accountant shall
be borne by the Party whose position with respect to the calculations in the
Statement of Disagreements bears the greatest difference from the final
position of the Neutral Accountant.

(c) The Parties agree that they will, and agree to cause the Target Companies
and Target Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of
the Statement of Closing Net Selected Assets and Other Items, the calculation
of the Closing Net Selected



 

19 Assets, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Hawker 1000 Inventory and Closing Net
Financing Receivables and in the conduct of the reviews and through the
determinations identified by _Section 2.8(a)_, including the making

Neutral Accountant books, records, work papers and personnel.

Section 2.9 _Adjustment To Purchase Price_.

Target Net Selected Assets, (ii) reduced by the amount, if any, of
the Estimated Indebtedness, (iii)(x) reduced by the amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Hawker 1000 Inventory is less than $133,000,000 or (y) increased
by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Hawker 1000 Inventory exceeds
$133,000,000 and (iv)(x) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the

Estimated Net Selected Assets exceeds the Final Closing Net Selected Assets or
(B) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Net Selected
Assets exceeds the Estimated Net Selected Assets, (ii)(A) reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the Final Closing Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated

amount, if any, by which the Estimated Hawker 1000 Inventory exceeds the Final

_2.9(b)(i)_ , taken together.

(d) Any payment made pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_ shall be made in cash
within ten (10) business days after such calculation has been determined
either by delivery by Parent to Buyer, in the case of a reduction to the
Preliminary Purchase Price, or by Buyer to Parent, in the case of an increase
in the Preliminary Purchase Price, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to an account of the other Party or by causing such payment to be
credited to such account of such other Party as may be designated by such
other Party. Any amount payable shall bear interest from and including the
Closing Date to but excluding the actual date of payment at the Reference
Rate, compounded quarterly. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as
the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of
a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed. The Preliminary
Purchase Price as so adjusted and as adjusted pursuant to _Section 9.7(a)_ is
referred to herein as the " _Purchase Price_ ".

41 permit, representatives of Buyer (including legal counsel, accountants and

(with respect to tax records, only to the extent such tax records pertain to
the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries and not to Group Taxes),
contracts, and documents of or pertaining to each of the Target Companies and
Target Subsidiaries, excluding access to information that is privileged,
subject to confidentiality provisions, relates to Affiliates of Parent other
than the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries or that is subject to legal
restrictions on access. Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure

any development of any events or occurrences that take place after the
date of this Agreement with respect to any matter first arising after the
date of this Agreement causing a breach of any of the representations and
warranties in _Article IV_ above. Such written notice will be deemed to have
amended the Disclosure Schedule and to have qualified the representations and
warranties contained in _Article IV_ above and to cure any misrepresentation
or breach of warranty thereunder for purposes of _Article VIII_ below, but
will not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule with
respect thereto or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty for purposes of _Section 7.1_ below.

(b) Each Party will give prompt written notice to the others of any material
adverse development causing a breach of any of its own representations and
warranties in _Article III_ above. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to
this _Section 5.5(b)_, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement _Annex
V_ , _Annex VI_ , or the Disclosure Schedule with respect thereto or to
prevent or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty for purposes of
_Article VII_ or _Article VIII_ hereof.

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or as may be necessary to
protect attorney client privilege, Parent and the Sellers shall keep Buyer
informed, on a current basis, of any events, discussions, notices or changes
with respect to any criminal or regulatory investigation or action involving
the Sellers (to the extent relating to the Business), the Target Companies or
the Target Subsidiaries so that Buyer and its Affiliates will have the
opportunity to take appropriate steps to avoid or mitigate any regulatory
consequences to them that might arise from such investigation or action.



 

42 Section 5.6 _Availability of Funds; Financing_.

(a) Buyer shall comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters
and use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange and obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, (ii)
negotiate and finalize definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, which agreements shall

applicable to Buyer in such definitive agreements that are within its
control, (iv) consummate the Financing no later than the Closing, and (v)
enforce its rights under the Financing Commitments. In the event all or any

unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated therein, Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such financing from
alternative sources on terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
Buyer as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the
" _Alternative Financing_ "), including entering into definitive agreements
with respect thereto (such definitive agreements entered into pursuant to this
_Section 5.6(a)_ being referred to as the " _Financing Agreements_ "). In
furtherance of the provisions of this Section 5.6(a), one or more Debt
Commitment Letters may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or superseded to add one or more lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, to increase the amount of
indebtedness or otherwise replace one or more facilities with one or more
new facilities or modify one or more facilities to replace or otherwise
modify the Debt Commitment Letters, or otherwise in manner not less beneficial
in the aggregate to Buyer (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer)
(the " _New Debt Financing Commitments_ "), provided that the New Debt
Financing Commitments shall not (i) adversely amend the conditions to the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, in any material respect,
(ii) reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing; or (iii) reduce
the aggregate amount of available Debt Financing (unless, in the case of this
clause (iii), replaced with an amount of new equity financing on terms no less
favorable in any material respect to Parent and the Sellers than the terms
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters or one or more new debt facilities
pursuant to the new debt facilities pursuant to the New Debt Financing
Commitments). Upon and from and after each such event, the term " _Debt
Financing_ " as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the
time in question and the New Debt Financing Commitments to the extent then in
effect. Buyer shall (x) furnish complete and correct and executed copies of
the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give Parent and
the Sellers prompt notice of any material breach by any party of
the Financing Commitments or any termination of the Financing Commitments and

Commitments.

and their respective accountants, consultants, legal counsel, officers and
employees to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide to Buyer, at
Buyers sole cost and expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer
in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause, upon reasonable advance notice by Buyer and on a
reasonable number of occasions, appropriate officers and employees of the
Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries to participate in



 

43 meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies and to assist with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) furnish Buyer and its debt financing
sources as promptly as practical with financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, including financial statements of the Audited
Entities required by Regulation S-X of the Securities Act for an offering of
securities registered on Form S-1 (excluding any additional financial
statements, schedules or disclosures required by Regulation S-X as a result of
the terms of Buyers offering of debt or other securities, including under
Rule 3-10 and Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X) that would be considered current
for purposes of a registration statement at the time of Closing (it being
understood that such financial statements shall be limited to audited
financial statements as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2004,
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006 and any unaudited interim financial
statements required for 2007), any unaudited quarterly financial data as
required by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act for each of the years ended
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006 and any unaudited pro-forma
adjustments for 2006 and any required interim period in 2007 needed to
reflect assets or liabilities included in such audited or unaudited financial
statements but not being acquired by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement)
(all such information in this clause (ii), the " _Required Information_ ",
which in no event shall include selected financial information for 2002 and
2003), (iii) obtain customary accountants comfort letters (including
"negative assurance" comfort on any pro forma financial data referenced
above, but it being understood that such comfort shall not be given with
respect to selected financial information for 2002 and 2003), legal opinions,
surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer; (iv) cooperate
with the marketing efforts of Buyer and its debt financing sources for any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and
assist Buyer and its financing sources in the timely preparation of offering
documents and similar documents and materials for lender and rating agency
presentations and (v) provide to Buyer unaudited monthly financial statements
of the Audited Entities (excluding footnotes) within 25 days of the end of
each month prior to the Closing Date adjusted to reflect assets or
liabilities included in such financial statements not being acquired by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that such monthly financial
statements shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the monthly
financial statements prepared by management of the Target Companies and Target
Subsidiaries); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) no officer or
director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Target
Companies and the Target Subsidiaries) shall be required to execute any
documents, including, without limitation, any registration statement to be
filed with the SEC, any pledge or security documents or other definitive
financing documents, (y) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing and (z) Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to limit the interference with the ongoing
operations of Parent. To Parents actual knowledge (after consultation with
its accountants and legal counsel), the Required Information satisfies the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act for an offering of
securities of the Target Companies registered on Form S-1 (excluding any
additional financial statements, schedules or disclosures required by
Regulation S-X as a result of the terms of Buyers offering of debt or other
securities, including under Rule 3-10 and Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X) for
purposes of a registration statement at the time of Closing (assuming



 

44 Closing occurs in Parents first or second fiscal quarter of 2007). Buyer
shall, promptly upon request by Parent, reimburse Parent and its Subsidiaries
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Parent or its Subsidiaries
in connection with such cooperation. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and its Subsidiaries for and against any and all Adverse Consequences
arising out of any claim by a third party (other than Adverse Consequences
which are the subject matter of any indemnification claim by any Buyer
Indemnitee against Parent or any of the Sellers as a result of a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.6(b)_ above)
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the
first period of 25 consecutive days after the later of (x) the date that is
seven (7) days following the date on which Buyer and its financing sources
shall have received from Parent all of the Required Information and (y)
February 21, 2006, (A) throughout and at the end of which (1) Buyer and its
financing sources shall have the Required Information and (2) nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ and _7.1(b)_ to fail to be satisfied (other than
conditions with respect to actions the respective Parties will take at the
Closing itself) assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during
such 25 consecutive-day period, and (B) throughout and at the end of which
the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ shall be satisfied; _provided_ ,
that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on
which the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
is consummated.

Section 5.7 _Compliance with Export and Import Regulations_. Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all ITAR registrations and licenses
necessary to operate the Business. Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain all customs bonds, dual use goods licenses and other similar export or
import registrations and licenses necessary to operate the Business (other
than ITAR registrations and licenses, which shall be governed by the

and Target Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with
Buyer obtaining the bonds, licenses and registrations as contemplated by this
_Section 5.7_ and shall provide Buyer will all information reasonably
requested by Buyer relating thereto, and Buyer shall pay all out of pocket

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain all FAA certificates, approvals and authorizations, as
are legally required by Law to be obtained by Buyer prior to the Closing
Date, for the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries to continue to operate
the Business with respect to the Products as operated immediately prior to
Closing, including all rights granted by the type certificates, amended
and/or supplemental type certificates, parts manufacturer approval, production

Companies and Target Subsidiaries reasonably incurred in connection with such
cooperation.



 

45 Section 5.9 _Replacement of Seller Guarantees_. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for replacement arrangements
(which shall include a full and complete release of Parent, each Seller and
their respective Affiliates) for all Seller Guarantees listed on Section 5.9
of the Disclosure Schedule as of the date hereof (which schedule sets forth
the maximum potential exposure of Parent or its affiliates under each of those
Seller Guarantees). Buyer will consult with Parent and the Sellers from time
to time concerning the progress made with respect to such efforts, and shall
permit Parent and the Sellers reasonable participation in such process. To the
extent Buyer is unable to make such arrangements with respect to any Seller
Guarantee (other than a Seller Guarantee of a Forward Foreign Exchange
Hedging Contract) prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Parent an
irrevocable, unconditional standby letter of credit or equivalent payment
surety in favor of Parent (the " _Buyer Guarantees_ ") in maximum face amount
equal to the amount set forth on Section 5.9 of the Disclosure Schedule
opposite each Seller Guarantee, issued by a bank rated "A" or better by
Standard and Poors, which Buyer Guarantee will contain customary
provisions and provisions permitting Parent to draw-down the Buyer Guarantees
if they are not replaced by replacement Buyer Guarantees of the same tenor not
less than three months prior to their expiration. Any amounts drawn down by
Parent in the foregoing circumstances will be held in an escrow account by
Parent as security against the Parent Guarantees. The Parties agree that, to
the extent that Parents potential liability under any Parent Guarantee
diminishes, the amount of the corresponding Buyer Guarantee will diminish by
the same amount. With respect to the Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging
Contracts, at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide to Parent a notice of its election to either (i) obtain a
novation to the Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contracts effective as of the
Closing such that (a) a nationally recognized bank reasonably acceptable to
Parent shall become a counterparty to such Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging
Contracts and (b) Parent, each Seller and their respective Affiliates receive
a full and complete release from the Seller Guarantee with respect thereto or
(ii) deliver to Parent, effective as of Closing, an
irrevocable, unconditional standby letter of credit or equivalent payment
surety in favor of Parent in a face amount equal to at least 20% of the
notional principal amount of any Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contracts
that are not the subject of a novation under clause (i) issued by a
nationally recognized bank reasonably acceptable to Parent on mutually
acceptable terms including with respect to (x) settlement or escrow
arrangements and (y) Parents right to cause Buyer or the applicable Buyer
Entity to terminate such Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contracts if at any
time the amount by which such Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contracts are
"out-of-the-money" exceeds the amount of the Letter of Credit issued with
respect thereto. If Buyer shall have delivered such a notice at least ten (10)
business days prior to the Closing Date, but at the Closing fails to deliver
to Parent (1) a full and complete release from such Seller Guarantee
in accordance with this _Section 5.9_ reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
the Sellers, or (2) an irrevocable, unconditional standby letter of credit in
favor of Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.9_,
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Sellers, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries party thereto to, deliver
at the Closing irrevocable instructions to the dealer counterparty to such
Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contract terminating such Forward Foreign
Exchange Hedging Contract effective as of the opening of business of the
business day immediately following the Closing Date. If Buyer does not deliver
such notice at least ten (10) business day prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall have the right to cause the



 

46 Target Company and Target Subsidiaries to terminate such Forward Foreign
Exchange Hedging Contract(s) at any time during and throughout such ten (10)
business day period prior to the Closing Date or thereafter. If, as a result
of the termination of any such Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contract on or
prior to the Closing Date, a foreign exchange gain results from such actions,
at Closing the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount
equal to such foreign exchange gain. If, as a result of the termination of any
such Forward Foreign Exchange Hedging Contract on or prior to the
Closing Date, a foreign exchange loss results from such actions, at Closing
the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to such
foreign exchange loss.

Section 5.10 _CFIUS and DSS Approval_. As soon as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, Buyer and Parent shall prepare and file with the CFIUS a
joint voluntary notice under the Exon-Florio Amendment with respect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Parent shall provide
CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS or
its member agencies during the Exon-Florio Amendment review process. Buyer
and Parent, in cooperation with each other but at Buyers sole cost, shall
take all commercially reasonable steps advisable, necessary or desirable to
finally and successfully complete the Exon-Florio Amendment review process as
promptly as practicable. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to (as applicable)
prepare and submit to the DSS a notification under the National Industrial
Security Program Operating Manual (the " _NISPOM_ ") and provide all
reasonable support to Buyer in requesting from the DSS approval to operate the
business of the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries pursuant to a Foreign
Ownership, Control, or Influence mitigation proposal submitted in relation to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the NISPOM
that is acceptable to Buyer acting reasonably.

Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries, who are covered by _Section 6.4_
below) from maintaining the same business relationships with the Buyer and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the Target Companies
and Target Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

Section 6.4 _Nonsolicitation; Noncompetition; Confidentiality_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year from and after the Closing Date, none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly, induce,
solicit or encourage any person who is at such time an employee of the Buyer
Entities to leave or curtail his or her employment with the Buyer Entities or
otherwise adversely modify such persons relationship with the Buyer Entities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be a violation of this _Section
6.4(a)_ for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) engage in general
advertising or employee search activities targeted to a broad pool of
potential applicants for a position (and not specifically targeting employees
of the Buyer Entities) or (y)(1) engage in any discussions with an employee
of the Buyer Entities who initiates contact with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (2) hire or attempt to hire any employee of the Buyer Entities
without prior solicitation in contravention of this  _Section 6.4(a)_.

(b) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, none of
Parent, the Sellers nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates will
directly or indirectly engage or invest in any business that manufacturers or
sells general aviation aircraft and/or components and/or training and special
mission aircraft and/or components, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
after-market parts and services relating to general aviation aircraft or
business jets (a " _Competing Business_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall not prohibit or restrict Parent, directly or
through any Affiliate, from (i) conducting any business activities conducted
by Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Target Companies and the Target
Subsidiaries) as of the date of this Agreement in substantially the manner
currently conducted or natural extensions of such business activities, (ii)
owning up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting debt or equity
securities of a Person that is engaged in a Competing Business and that is
publicly traded on a



 

48 national securities exchange or over-the-counter market, (iii) acquiring the
business or assets of any Person (a " _Target Business_ "), whether by
purchase of stock, purchase of assets, merger, recapitalization or otherwise,
that conducts a Competing Business and the subsequent conduct of the Target
Business so long as not more than forty percent (40%) of the gross revenues
of the Target Business for the immediately prior fiscal year were derived from
such Competing Business or (iv) being acquired by any Person that conducts a
Competing Business as of the date of such acquisition and the subsequent
conduct of such Competing Business and natural extensions thereof. In the
event Parent, directly or through any Affiliate, completes an acquisition of a
Target Business which derived more than forty percent (40%) of its
gross revenue for the immediately prior fiscal year from a Competing
Business, Parent shall, within twelve (12) months from such investment or
acquisition, either (A) divest such portion of the Competing Business or (B)
cease operating the Competing Business.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree that
irreparable damage may occur in the event that the provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ were not performed in accordance with their specific terms and,
accordingly, it is agreed that Buyer shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
_Section 6.4_ in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer is
entitled in law or in equity. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this _Section
6.4_ is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

(d) Each of Parent, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents shall hold any information relating to
the Target Companies, the Target Subsidiaries, Buyer or their respective
Affiliates (other than Parent and the Sellers) currently in any of their
possession or obtained after the date hereof which is non-public in confidence
and shall not, directly or indirectly disclose, publish or otherwise make
available any of such confidential information to the public or to any Person;
_provided_ that such Persons may disclose such Confidential Information if,
but only to the extent, required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any securities exchange or any securities
exchange regulation, in which case the Person proposing to disclose, publish
or otherwise make available such information shall make all reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith with Buyer before disclosing, publishing or
otherwise making available such information and shall provide a copy thereof
to Buyer prior to such disclosure.

Section 6.5 _Use of Name and Trademarks; Website Links; License to Certain
Affiliates of Sellers_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event more than
ten (10) days thereafter, the names of the Target Companies and the Target
Subsidiaries shall be changed to names that do not include any names or marks
owned or used by



 

49 Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers, whether alone or in combination with any
other words, phrases or designs or any derivatives, abbreviations, acronyms
or other formatives based on or including any of the foregoing or any other
similar name or mark of Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers or any marks or
logos confusingly similar thereto, including the marks set forth on Section
6.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Raytheon Marks_ ") and
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not use, and shall cause the Target Companies
and Target Subsidiaries not to use, the Raytheon Marks (including in any
domain names) other than for purposes of describing the historical
relationship of the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries with the Sellers
and their Affiliates. Within ten (10) business days of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries to deliver to
Parent evidence, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that
ownership of any and all domain name registrations owned by the Target
Companies or Target Subsidiaries that contain any Raytheon Mark (including
the domain name registrations set forth on Section 6.5(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule) has been transferred to Parent, including duly executed and
notarized (if applicable) copies of all instruments of transfer and other
documents required to be filed with the applicable registrar and
acknowledgment of receipt of such filings by the registrar. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, for a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date (or, if
longer, with respect to all deliverable products associated with or required
to be delivered as part of an aircraft, including manuals and spare parts,
until the later of (x) such time as the relevant Governmental Entity grants a
name change (a request for which will be made by Buyer as soon as practicable
after the Closing) and (y) the supply existing as of the Closing Date has been
exhausted, but in no event for a period of more than twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date), Parent hereby grants to Buyer and its Affiliates the
limited and non-exclusive right and license (which right and license shall not
be transferable or sublicenseable) to use the Raytheon Marks solely in
connection with the operation of the Business (and subject at all times to
Parents right to exercise quality control with respect to the use of the
Raytheon Marks and the goodwill associated therewith) in the process of
exhausting the inventory of printed purchase orders, sales invoices,
marketing materials, stationery, printed forms, other documents and office and
shipping supplies, and other products, equipment, and items (other than
aircraft) bearing the Raytheon Marks in the Target Companies and/or
Target Subsidiaries possession as of the Closing Date on a royalty-free
basis, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ that
the Buyer Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
any such materials containing the Raytheon Marks shall display prominently
(in such form as is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and/or its Affiliates, as
applicable, and Parent in writing prior to the Closing Date) a statement as to
the new ownership of the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries, and
_provided further_ that the foregoing license shall be effective only upon
Buyers obtaining aircraft product liability insurance policies naming Parent,
Sellers and each of their Affiliates as additional insureds in accordance
with _Section 6.7_. In connection with such limited use of the Raytheon Marks
permitted under this _Section 6.5(a)_, Buyer acknowledges that all use
thereof by Buyer and its Affiliates and all goodwill associated therewith
shall inure solely to Parents benefit and shall not create in Buyers or any
of its Affiliates favor any right, title or interest in or to the Raytheon
Marks. Without limiting anything contained herein, subject to the procedures
set forth in _Section 8.4_ and _Section 8.7_, Buyer shall indemnify Parent
and the Sellers from and against any damages, dues, penalties, fines, costs,
liabilities, obligations, losses, expenses, and fees, including court costs
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, Parent or any of the Sellers
shall suffer caused proximately by Buyers or any of its Affiliates use of
the Raytheon Marks permitted under this



 

50 Section 6.5(a) (other than any such damages arising out of third-party claims
of trademark infringement caused proximately by Buyers or any of its
Affiliates use of the Raytheon Marks permitted under this _Section 6.5(a)_).
No limitations on indemnification in this Agreement or exclusions from Adverse
Consequences shall apply to Buyers indemnification obligations under this
_Section 6.5(a)_.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event more than
thirty (30) days thereafter, Buyer and its Affiliates shall cause the Target
Companies and Target Subsidiaries to remove any content, images and links on
any of their Internet pages or websites to the extent related to
the operation of the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(c) If within six (6) months after the Closing Date, Parent notifies Buyer or
any Target Company or Target Subsidiary in writing that it or any of its
Affiliates has identified any Intellectual Property owned by any Target
Company or Target Subsidiary that, as of the Closing Date, was used in the
operation of the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates (or was planned
for such use as evidenced by reasonable documentation) and specifically
identifies such Intellectual Property in such notice, Buyer or such Target
Company or Target Subsidiary, as applicable, shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent commercially reasonable terms and conditions for a license to
Parent and/or the relevant Affiliate to use such Intellectual Property in the
operation of the business of Parent and/or any of its Affiliates as conducted
or proposed to be conducted as of the Closing Date and natural extensions
thereof (which license would be deemed effective as of the Closing Date).
Buyer or such Target Company or Target Subsidiary shall not have
any obligation to grant any such license to Intellectual Property if it does
not have the right to do so or if doing so would cause Buyer or such Target
Company or Target Subsidiary to incur any payment or other obligation to any
Person. With respect to any Intellectual Property identified as being used
(but not primarily used) in the business or Parent or any of its Affiliates,
any such license to such Intellectual Property may be subject to Parent and
Buyer (or, as applicable, such Target Company or Target Subsidiary) mutually
agreeing upon royalties and/or other payments to Buyer (or, as applicable,
such Target Company or Target Subsidiary). The license granted to Parent
and/or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this  _Section 6.5(c)_ shall be (x)
exclusive with respect to the use of Intellectual Property relating to any
commuter aircraft designated as Model 1900 or Model 99, whether in operation,
on ground or in storage (the " _Affected Aircraft_ ") used or planned for use
primarily in the promotion, marketing, sale, leasing and support of the
Affected Aircraft, and (y) non-exclusive with respect to all other
Intellectual Property covered by the license. This covenant shall not apply
to the extent otherwise provided or contemplated in _Section 6.5_ of this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement.

(d) If within six (6) months after the Closing Date, any Target Company or
Target Subsidiary notifies Parent in writing that it has identified any
Intellectual Property owned by Parent or any of its Affiliates that, as of the
Closing Date, was used in the Business (or was planned for such use as
evidenced by reasonable documentation) and specifically identifies such
Intellectual Property in such notice, Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent shall negotiate in good faith with Buyer (or such Target
Company or Target Subsidiary, as applicable), commercially reasonable terms
and conditions for a non-exclusive license to the relevant Target Company
and/or Target Subsidiary and their controlled Affiliates to use such
Intellectual Property in the operation of the business of such Target Company
or Target Subsidiary as conducted or proposed to be conducted as of the
Closing Date and



 

51 natural extensions thereof (which license would be deemed effective as of the
Closing Date). Neither Parent nor any of its wholly owned subsidiaries shall
have any obligation to grant any such license to Intellectual Property if (i)
it does not have the right to do so or if doing so would cause Parent or any
of its wholly owned subsidiaries to incur any payment or other obligation to
any Person, and/or (ii) Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries has any
reasonable confidentiality or security concerns in relation to its core
defense business. With respect to any Intellectual Property identified as
being used (but not primarily used) in the Business, any such license to such
Intellectual Property may be subject to Parent and Buyer (or such Target
Company or Target Subsidiary, as applicable) mutually agreeing upon royalties
and/or other payments to Parent and/or Sellers, as applicable. This covenant
shall not apply (x) to the extent otherwise provided or contemplated in
_Section 6.5_ of this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement or (y) without
limiting the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, to training materials
which shall be governed exclusively by the PPandP License Agreement included in
the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 6.6 _Labor Matters; WARN Act_.

(a) If Buyer takes any action after the Closing Date which independently, or
in connection with any reduction in the size of the Business work force
occurring within the ninety (90) day period prior to the Closing Date, could
be construed as a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as those terms are
defined in the WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local law,
regulation or ordinance, Buyer shall be responsible for providing any notice
required by the WARN Act (or such similar legal obligation) and Buyer and
Parent shall be jointly responsible for making all payments (including
compensation and benefits payable or provided during any notice period), if
any, required by the WARN Act based on the number of people terminated before
and after the Closing. Provided that on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent
has provided Buyer with a list of employee layoffs and location in the 90 day
period preceding the Closing Date, any and all penalties and costs (of Buyer
or Parent or its Subsidiaries), if any, which may result from any failure to
provide any notice required by the WARN Act shall be the sole responsibility
of Buyer.

Section 6.7 _Insurance_.

(a) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Target Companies to, maintain aircraft product
liability insurance policies with insurance companies that have a current A.M
Best rating of not less than "A-", and for a period of three (3) years
thereafter, Buyer shall maintain aircraft product liability insurance policies
with insurance companies that have a current A.M Best rating of not less than
"A-" unless the annual premiums required to be paid with respect to such
insurance policies exceed 110% of the premiums of such insurance policies with
respect to the prior year. Such insurance policies shall designate Parent and
each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates, as its interest may
appear, as additional insureds. The limits of liability, deductibles or
retentions of such product liability insurance shall be similar in all
material respects to the limits of liability, deductibles or retentions
maintained by companies of a similar financial size and a similar business
purpose as Buyer after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Except with respect to the Retained Insurance Liabilities, Parent shall
provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer in order to afford Buyer the right to
receive payment, after the Closing, under any insurance policies of Parent
covering the Business prior to



 

52 the Closing (the " _Existing Policies_ ") with respect to any claim or loss
covered by such policies that relates to any of the assets or liabilities of
the Business, including without limitation claims currently being processed
under such insurance policies. Buyer shall promptly notify Parent of the
occurrence of any events that might form the basis of such an insurance claim
and the amount of such claim, and shall have the right to tender claims under
the Existing Policies. Any such rights of Buyer to receive payment on any such
insurance claim shall be subject to any deductibles, self-insured retentions,
retained amounts, retentions or exclusions, to Buyers payment of any
retrospectively rated premiums that become due and payable after the Closing,
and to the other terms of the applicable insurance policy. If so requested
by Parent, Buyer shall, as a condition to receiving payment on any such
insurance claim, make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent for the
payment directly to the applicable insurance carrier of any amounts which are
the responsibility of Buyer in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not require Parent to convert any "claims
made" policy to an "occurrence based" policy and shall not obligate Parent to
maintain any insurance policy in effect such that it covers claims made or
events occurring after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the
Closing, in no event shall Parent or its Affiliates (i) have any obligation to
pursue an insurer under any of the policies of Parent on behalf of any of the
Buyer Entities or (ii) have any liability to any of the Buyer Entities as a
result of the refusal by an insurer under any of the policies of Parent to
reimburse or pay any of the Buyer Entities with respect to any claim
submitted by any of the Buyer Entities.

(c) To the extent reasonably available, for a period of five (5) years from
and after the Closing Date, Parent and the Sellers agree to continue to
provide the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries with (i) updated loss
information regarding pre-closing occurrences and (ii) access to engineering
or safety surveys completed by insurers prior to Closing.

Section 6.8 _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

Section 6.9 _Confidentiality_. From the date hereof through the Closing Date,
the Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates will treat and hold as such any Confidential Information (other
than Confidential Information of the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries)
that it or its Affiliates received from Parent, the Sellers or the Target
Companies or Target Subsidiaries in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreements.

Section 6.10 _Confidentiality Agreements_. At Closing, Parent and the Sellers
shall (a) deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer true and complete copies
of each confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (other than
with Affiliates of Buyer or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement) entered into
at any time in connection with the potential sale of the Target Companies and
that relates in any way to the Target Companies or the Target Subsidiaries
(each an " _NDA_ ") and (b) irrevocably assign to Buyer Parents and the
Sellers right, title and interest in and to each NDA (such assignment to be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer).

Section 6.11 _Post-Closing Access_. For a period of 3 (three) years from and
after the Closing Date, Parent and the Sellers will permit representatives of
Buyer (including legal counsel, accountants and financing sources) to have
reasonable access at all



 

53 reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, to all premises, properties,
personnel, books, records (with respect to tax records, only to the extent
such tax records pertain to the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries and
not to Group Taxes), contracts, and documents of or pertaining to each of the
Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably necessary
in connection with (x) a Tax audit of (or the determination of any Tax
attribute of) any of the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries or (y) the
preparation of historical financial statements (and pro-forma or other
adjustments thereto) of the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries, in each
case to the extent related to pre-Closing periods, excluding access to
information that is privileged, subject to confidentiality provisions, relates
to Affiliates of Parent other than the Target Companies and Target
Subsidiaries or that is subject to legal restrictions on access. Buyer will
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries. Buyer shall keep all information and records that are not
related to the Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries that it receives as a
result of this _Section 6.11_ confidential and shall limit the use and
circulation of such information and records to employees, advisers,
attorneys, accountants, and financial advisors having an actual and legitimate
need to know and only to the extent reasonably necessary and who are informed
of the confidential nature of the information and records and are required to
keep it confidential in accordance with this provision, except with respect to
such confidential information that (A) was known to Buyer before its
disclosure by Parent and the Sellers, (B) is, or shall become, generally
known in the Buyers industry other than as a result of Buyers disclosure in
violation of this _Section 6.11_, (C) shall be disclosed to the Buyer by a
third party not known by Buyer to be under any obligation to keep such
information confidential, or (D) Buyer is required or compelled by Law to
disclose (whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information
or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process
or as necessary for Buyer to disclose in connection with filing Tax Returns or
registering securities or filing documents with regulatory authorities under
applicable securities laws); _provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer is
required or compelled by Law to produce any such confidential information,
Buyer will provide Parent with prompt written notice. The access referenced
herein shall be afforded to Buyer and its representatives upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Buyer shall be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this
_Section 6.11_.

Section 6.12 _Employee Leases_. To the extent that any Employee Lease is not
assigned to a Target Company or Target Subsidiary prior to Closing, the
Parties shall cooperate to ensure that such Employee Lease is assigned to a
Buyer Entity (as directed by Buyer) as reasonably as practical following
Closing.

Section 6.13 _Administration of Raytheon Corporate Jets Pension Scheme_.
Following the Closing, RASL shall continue to administer the Raytheon
Corporate Jets Pension Scheme for the full term of such scheme. As
consideration therefore, at the Closing U.K. Buyer shall pay to RASL an
amount equal to £510,204, by delivery of cash payable by wire transfer or
delivery of other immediately available funds.

Indemnitees_ ") from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences
arising out of such Sellers breach. In addition, Parent and the Sellers
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against the entirety of any
Adverse Consequences arising out of (i) any liability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates that is not a liability of the Target Companies or Target
Subsidiaries or (ii) any Retained Liabilities.

of any Adverse Consequences arising from (i) the presence of Hazardous
Substances at, on, about, under, within or migrating to or from any real
property formerly owned, leased or operated by the Target Companies, the
Target Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors (the " _Former Facilities_
"), (ii) the generation by, transportation from, arranging for disposal and/or
disposal by, any Former Facilities of any Hazardous Substances or (iii) any
claim by any third party (other than a Governmental Entity) for personal
injury or property damage arising from any alleged exposure on or prior to the

the Facilities. With respect to any claim for indemnification under this
_Section 8.2(b)_, Parent, the Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other and render to each other such assistance as the other may reasonably
request, which assistance shall include, without limitation, allowing
reasonable access to property, making appropriate personnel available and
providing factual background and technical data.

(c) Any Adverse Consequences indemnifiable both under (i) _Section 8.2(a)_
based on any breach of the representations or warranties set forth in _Section
4.16_, and (ii) _Section 8.2(b)_ or the second sentence of  _Section

applicable survival period, Buyer shall indemnify Parent and the Sellers from
and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences arising out of or in

58 Section 8.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(a) If any third party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to
a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under this _Article VIII_ , then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly (and in any event within five business days after receiving notice
of the Third-Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing;
_provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves
only the payment of money damages and does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party.

(c) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third-
Party Claim as provided in _Section 8.4(b)_ above, however, the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably
deem appropriate.

(d) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment on or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of each of the Indemnifying Parties
(not to be unreasonably withheld).

(e) This _Section 8.4_ shall not apply to Tax Proceedings, which shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.4_.

Section 8.5  _Indemnification Procedures for Environmental Matters_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any claim for
indemnification arising from any breach of the representations or warranties
set forth in  _Section 4.16_ relating to any of the Facilities:

(a) Parent and the Sellers shall have the right to control the defense
or negotiation (including, without limitation, any investigatory, response
and remedial actions) of any matters as to which it is responsible to
indemnify Buyer under _Section 8.2(a)_ based on any breach of the
representations or warranties set forth in _Section 4.16_ (a " _Seller
Controlled Environmental Matter_ ") to the extent the Deductible has been
exceeded, with attorneys, consultants, contractors, and experts reasonably
acceptable to Buyer; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary and to the extent the Deductible has not been exceeded, Buyer
shall provide reasonable notice to, and reasonably consult with, Parent and
the Sellers with respect to any matters arising from or related to a breach
of the representations or warranties set forth in _Section 4.16_ as is
reasonably necessary to enable Parent and the Sellers to timely assume the
control of the defense or negotiation of any Seller Controlled Environmental
Matter. No compromise or settlement in respect of any Seller Controlled
Environmental Matter may be reached by the Parent or the Sellers without
Buyers prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).



 

59 (b) With respect to any Seller Controlled Environmental Matter, Buyer shall
have the right to (i) participate in any material meetings or negotiations
with any governmental entity or other third party (excluding meetings attended
solely by counsel, consultants or other experts retained by Parent or the
Sellers, in which case counsel, consultants or other experts retained by
Buyer shall have such right), and shall be provided with reasonable advance
notice of the same, and (ii) to the extent practicable, review in advance and
provide comments on any documents proposed to be submitted to governmental
entities or other third parties, including, without limitation, any proposed
or final work plan, report, compliance schedule, compliance or consent order,
decree or agreement, which comments shall in good faith be considered for
incorporation by Parent and the Sellers. Buyer, Parent and the Sellers
covenant and agree to maintain the confidence of all drafts and comments
provided by the other party.

(c) Parent, the Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and render
to each other such assistance as the other may reasonably request,
which assistance shall include, without limitation, allowing reasonable
access to property, making appropriate personnel available and providing
factual background and technical data.

(d) Buyer shall not have any right to indemnification for any Adverse
Consequences to the extent that the environmental conditions underlying
such Adverse Consequences are discovered as a result of any sampling or
testing of any soil, groundwater or other environmental media or material that
is not (i) required by Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, (ii)
reasonably necessary in connection with defense of an unsolicited third party
claim or Governmental Entity directive, (iii) necessary for the lawful
completion of a construction project undertaken for business reasons
independent of the availability of indemnification hereunder, or (iv)
necessary in the reasonable judgment of Buyer in the conduct of its business
independent of the availability of indemnification hereunder (after reasonable
notice to, and consultation with, Parent and the Sellers) to investigate
facts first obtained after the Closing Date indicating the potential existence
of conditions of contamination or non-compliance with Environmental, Health,
and Safety Requirements, which, if confirmed, would require investigation,
remediation, response action, or other action to correct such non-compliance,
in each case pursuant to Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements. Buyer
shall not have any right to indemnification with respect to
any investigatory, response or remedial action except to the extent such
action is required by Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements and then
only to the extent of any such action reasonably necessary to attain
compliance in a cost effective manner with Environmental, Health, and Safety
Requirements assuming continued commercial or industrial use of the subject
property and employing risk based standards, engineering controls and
institutional controls (including, without limitation, deed restrictions and
activity and use limitations) where available and appropriate given the
current use of the Facility that is the subject of such action.

Section 8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.2_



 

60 for any Adverse Consequences arising from the breach of any representations or
warranties of Parent or the Sellers contained in _Section 4.6_ through
_Section 4.25_ of this Agreement (other than _Section 4.15(f)_) unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such claims is at least 1% of the Purchase
Price (the " _Deductible_ ") (and Parent and the Sellers shall only be
required to indemnify Buyer for such claims in excess of the Deductible). The
aggregate liability of Parent and the Sellers under this _Article VIII_ for
breaches of any representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement is limited to an amount equal to $200,000,000.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and the Sellers
shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer against any Adverse Consequences
arising from or relating to any claim or liability to the extent such claim or
liability is taken into account in determining the adjustment to the
Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.9_ above; and

(c) In valuing an Adverse Consequence, no adjustment shall be made as a
result of any multiple, increase factor, or any other premium over fair market
value, book or historical value which may have been paid by Buyer whether or
not such multiple, increase factor or other premium had been used by Buyer at
the time of, or in connection with, calculating or preparing its bid, its
proposed purchase price or its final purchase price.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and the Seller
shall only be obligated to indemnify Buyer against 75% of any Adverse
Consequences arising from the breach of any representations or warranties of
Parent or the Sellers contained in Section 4.16 that Parent and the Sellers
would otherwise be obligated to indemnify Buyer against pursuant to this
_Article VIII_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Party may recover any claims for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ for punitive, special, consequential, incidental or
opportunity cost damages of any kind, loss of reputation or goodwill, stigma
damages, loss of property value, damages related to delays in business plans,
site development or redevelopment or associated income streams, natural
resource damages, or the loss of anticipated or future business or profits
other than to the extent that a Third Party Claim results in the payment by
the Indemnified Party to a third party of such damages. 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Buyer shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to any matters arising under Environmental, Health and Safety
Requirements for any Adverse Consequences to the extent the facts, events or
circumstances giving rise to such Adverse Consequences are caused or
exacerbated by any willful or grossly negligent act or omission of Buyer, any
Buyer Indemnitee, or (except with respect to such indemnification under
_Section 8.2(a)(ii)_, _8.2(b)(i)_ or _8.2(b)(ii)_ ) any third party, after
the Closing Date. 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and the Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer against any
Adverse Consequences under _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ with respect to any claim
for indemnification that is not asserted in writing before the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date.



 

61 Section 8.7 _Determination of Adverse Consequences_. All indemnification
payments under this  _Article VIII_ shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party
net of any insurance coverage that is available to the Indemnified Party after
giving effect to any increase in insurance premiums as a result thereof. All
indemnification payments under this _Article VIII_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
except as otherwise set forth in _Articles IX_ , _X_ , _XI_ , _Section 12.15_
and in any Ancillary Agreement, the foregoing indemnification provisions in
this _Article VIII_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect
to the Retained Liabilities, the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries, the
Business, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (other than claims for fraud). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) the Parties acknowledge and agree that they
shall not have any remedy after the Closing for any breach of the
representations and warranties in _Articles III_ or _IV_ above following the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 8.1_ above, _provided_ ,
that such representations and warranties shall survive beyond such survival
periods with respect to any breach thereof if written notice thereof shall
have been duly given within the applicable survival period and (ii) Buyer
understands and agrees that its right to indemnification under _Section
8.2(a)_ for breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_ Section 4.16_ and under _Section 8.2(b)_ shall constitute its sole and
exclusive remedy against Parent, the Sellers and their Subsidiaries with
respect to any environmental, health, or safety matters relating to the
Facilities, the Former Facilities, and all other past, current, or future
facilities, properties, or operations of the Business, the Target Companies
and Target Subsidiaries and all of their respective predecessors or
Affiliates, including without limitation any such matter arising under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or any
other Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, and Buyer hereby waives
any right (aside from such right to indemnification), whether arising at law
or in equity, to seek contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other
recourse or remedy from Parent, the Sellers or their Subsidiaries, and hereby
releases each of Parent, the Sellers and their Subsidiaries from any claim,
demand, or liability, with respect to any such matters.

except the Employees of the Business set forth on Section 9.1 of the
Disclosure Schedule, whether relating to employee benefits or post-Closing

opportunities), as applicable, and employee benefits under plans, programs and
arrangements which, in the aggregate, will provide compensation and benefits
to the Employees of the Business which, taken together, are no less favorable
to the Employees of the Business than compensation and benefits provided to
Employees of the Business immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees
(i) to adopt and establish effective as of the Closing Date the Retention Plan
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ (the " _Retention Plan_ ") and (ii)

required by applicable law in any non-U.S. jurisdiction and non-U.K.
jurisdiction.

Section 9.4  _Severance_. The Buyer Entities shall provide severance or
similar termination benefits to each Employee of the Business who is covered
by the RAC severance policy attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the " _RAC

Target Companies and the Target Subsidiaries (and their successors), to the
same extent recognized under such plan prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
recognize, for purposes of eligibility and vesting under all employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements established by the Buyer Entities after the
Closing Date for the benefit of the Employees of the Business, service with
Parent, Parents Subsidiaries, the Target Companies and the Target

requirements under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans
continued, established or maintained by the Buyer Entities for the benefit of

the Buyer Entities failure to comply after Closing with the Collective
Bargaining Agreements or any changes to the terms and conditions of those
Agreements agreed to by Buyer after Closing.

Company or Target Subsidiary designated by Buyer. No earlier than ten (10)
days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall make cash contributions to each
of the Raytheon Aircraft Holdings, Inc. Base Retirement Income Plan, the
Raytheon Aircraft Company Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Paid Employees and
the Raytheon Aircraft Company Retirement Income Plan for Salaried Employees
(the " _Funded Plans_ ") in the amount sufficient to cause the assets of the
Funded Plans as of the Closing Date to equal (x) the accumulated benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2006 (which amount shall be disclosed to Buyer
no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), as determined
by the Funded Plans enrolled actuary under FAS 87 using actuarial assumptions
as set forth in Section 9.7(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, plus (y) an
additional cash contribution totaling $3,000,000 in the aggregate (allocated
to each such plan as determined by the Parties) (the " _Funded Plan
Contributions_ "). If the Funded Plan Contributions cannot be accurately
determined by the Closing Date, Parent shall make estimated Funded Plan
Contributions to the Funded Plans on the Closing Date. If the estimated Funded
Plan Contributions exceed the Funded Plan Contributions, Buyer shall, as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date, reimburse Parent the amount of the excess. If the estimated Funded Plan
Contributions are less than the Funded Plan Contributions, Parent shall, as

Date in the amount of the shortfall (or, if Parent cannot make tax deductible
contributions post Closing, the amount of the shortfall shall reduce the
Preliminary Purchase Price). Parent, the Sellers, and the Buyer Entities shall
cause assets that are held in trust and relate to liabilities assumed by
the Buyer Entities with respect to Funded Plans to be transferred to a trust
or trusts that are associated with such plans and are subject to the direction
of one or more of the Buyer Entities. As soon as administratively feasible
after the Closing Date, Parent, the Sellers and the Buyer Entities shall, in

accrued but unused vacation and sick days to which any Employee of the
Business has earned as of the Closing Date, (ii) subject to the Ancillary
Agreements,

Person (other than a Target Company or a Target Subsidiary) and any of the
Target Companies or Target Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing
Date without further liability to any party to such agreement.

Section 10.2 _Taxes of Other Persons_.

(a) Parent and the Sellers agree to be responsible for and to indemnify Buyer,
the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries and their Affiliates from and
against (i) all Tax liabilities of the Target Companies and the Target
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all Group Taxes for all
taxable periods that end on, prior to or include the Closing Date and (iii)
all Tax liabilities of RASL, Parent and any Affiliate of Parent that is not a
Target Company or a Target Subsidiary.

(b) Buyer agrees to be responsible for and to indemnify Parent and its
Affiliates from and against all Tax liabilities of the Target Companies and
Target Subsidiaries (other than RASL) for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

Section 10.3 _Returns for Periods Through the Closing Date_.

(a) _Group Returns_. Parent shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed all Group Tax Returns and all Tax Returns of RASL for all taxable
periods ending on, prior to or that include the Closing Date. Parent shall
pay all Taxes in connection with such Tax Returns. Each Target Company (Buyer
with respect to RASL) and each Target Subsidiary shall timely furnish Tax
information and pro forma Group Tax Returns to Parent with respect to such
Target Company or such Target Subsidiary in accordance with past custom and
practice as reasonably requested by Parent for the preparation of the Group
Tax Returns to be prepared by Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence.
Parent shall provide Buyer with a copy of the portion of such Tax Return that
relates to a Target Company or a Target Subsidiary ten (10) days after the
filing of such Tax Return other than with respect to RASL, and shall provide a
copy of any RASL Tax Return at such reasonable time after the filing of such
Tax Return as may be requested in writing by Buyer. If Parent intends to use a
pro forma Group Tax Return or Tax information that differs from that provided
by Buyer with respect to such Group Tax Return, Parent shall provide Buyer a
copy of such pro forma Group Tax Return or such Tax information twenty (20)
days prior to the filing of the relevant Group Tax Return by Parent, or, if
later, as soon as reasonably practical after Parent decides to use a pro
forma Group Tax Return or Tax information that differs from that provided by
Buyer.



 

65 (b) _Non-Group Returns_. Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared
and filed each Tax Return required to be filed by or with respect to a Target
Company (other than RASL) or a Target Subsidiary for any taxable period ending
on, prior to, or including the Closing Date that is not a Group Tax Return.
Buyer shall provide Parent with a copy of each Tax Return prepared pursuant
to the preceding sentence with respect to which Buyer will seek
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ together with all necessary
supporting work papers at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date of
such Tax Return for Parents review and comment, accompanied by a statements
setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Taxes for any Straddle
Period allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. With respect to each such
Return that is not a Straddle Return, Buyer shall consider in good faith any
comments by the Sellers and shall incorporate such comments to the extent such
comments are in accordance with Tax law and comport with the methodology set
forth in Section 10.3(c). With respect to each such Tax Return that is a
Straddle Return, Buyer shall consider in good faith any comments by the
Sellers. Buyer shall remit to the appropriate Tax authorities all Taxes of a
Target Company or a Target Subsidiary due with respect to such Tax Returns.
Parent shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,

Parent. For purposes of this _Article X_ , in the case of any Taxes payable
for a Straddle Tax Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes
measured by gross receipts, sales and income, payroll, withholding (including
employee withholding) and similar Taxes be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period,
and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the
Closing Date, assuming that the taxable year of any pass-through entity in
which any Target Company or Target Subsidiary owns an interest ended on and
included the Closing Date. 

(c) _Preparation_. All Tax Returns addressed in this _Section 10.3_ shall be
prepared in accordance with the methodology used by Parent, the Sellers, and
the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries in prior taxable periods, except
as required by law.

Section 10.4 _Audits_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent shall have the right to conduct and control any audit, dispute,
administrative judicial or other Tax proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with
respect to any Group Tax Return and any Tax Return of RASL, for any taxable
period ending on, prior to or that includes the Closing Date, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall be kept reasonably apprised of the conduct of
such Tax Proceeding to the extent the audit relates to a Target Company or a
Target Subsidiary. Parent shall also have the right to conduct and control any
Tax Proceeding with respect to a Target Company or a Target Subsidiary for any
tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that is not with respect
to a Group Tax Return, _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be kept
apprised of the conduct of such Tax Proceeding and shall be entitled to
participate in such audit at



 

66 Buyers expense. Parent shall not be entitled to settle any Tax Proceeding of
a Target Company or a Target Subsidiary if such settlement could reasonably
be expected to have any adverse effect on Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
(including any adverse precedential effect) for any Post-Closing Tax Period,
without the consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer
shall have the right to conduct and control any Tax Proceeding with respect to
any Straddle Period, provided however, that to the extent related to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period item for which Parent could be liable hereunder, Parent
shall be kept apprised of the conduct of such Tax Proceeding and shall be
entitled to participate in such audit at Parents expense. Buyer shall not be
entitled to settle any Tax Proceeding of a Target Company or a
Target Subsidiary if such settlement could reasonably be expected to create a
liability hereunder for any Pre-Closing Tax Period item, without the consent
of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 10.5 _Cooperation_. Parent and Buyer shall cooperate and cause their
affiliates to cooperate with respect to the preparation of and the filing of
any Tax Return and the Conduct of any Tax Proceeding addressed in this
_Article X_ , Buyer, the Target Companies, and the Target Subsidiaries shall,
upon Parents request, provide records and information that are relevant to
any Tax Return of Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller and any Tax Proceeding
conducted by Seller and shall make employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. With respect to Tax Returns for any Pre Closing
Tax Period or the pre-Closing Date portion of any Straddle Period of any
entity that was a Subsidiary of a Target Company or a Target Subsidiary prior
to the transactions contemplated herein and which Tax Returns were
historically prepared by personnel of a Target Company or a Target Subsidiary,
Buyer shall make its personnel available to assist in the timely preparations
of such Tax Returns, provided that (i) all out of pocket expenses borne
in connection with the preparation of such returns shall be the
responsibility of Parent, and (ii) Parent shall execute a release of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries with respect to any liabilities related the preparation of
such Tax Returns. Parent, Sellers, and their Affiliates shall, upon Buyers
request, provide records and information that are relevant to any Tax Return
of Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer and any Proceeding conducted by Buyer and
shall make employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Buyer, the Target Companies, and the Target Subsidiaries agree (a) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Target
Companies and Target Subsidiaries relating to any period prior to the end of
the Closing Date until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Sellers,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods and (ii) ten (10)
years from the Closing Date, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (b) to give Parent reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if Parent so requests, Buyer, the Target Companies and the
Target Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall allow Parent to take possession
of such books and records. Buyer may reasonably request and if so requested
Parent shall provide Buyer with copies of the portion of any Group Tax Returns
to the extent they relate to the Target Companies or the Target Subsidiaries.

Section 10.6 _Indemnification for Post-Closing Transactions_. Buyer agrees to
indemnify Parent for any additional Tax owed by Parent and its Subsidiaries
resulting from (a) any transaction engaged in by Buyer, the Target Companies
(other than RASL) or Target Subsidiaries on the Closing Date not in the
Ordinary Course of Business after Buyers purchase of the Target Interests
or 



 

67 (b) any election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to a
Foreign Target Subsidiary during or in respect of the taxable year of Parent
that includes the Closing Date, that affects the amount, timing or character
to Parent and its Subsidiaries of any Tax item relating to RASL or the Foreign
Target Subsidiaries.

Section 10.7 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Parent and its Affiliates will
join with the Buyer in making a joint election under Code Section 338(h)(10)
(and any corresponding election under applicable state or local Law) to treat
as an acquisition of assets (a " _338(h)(10) Election_ ") the purchase and
sale for tax purposes of RAC and each other Target Subsidiary (other than a
Foreign Target Subsidiary) with respect to which Buyer requests. The Parent
and Buyer shall cooperate fully with each other in the making of such
elections. At the Closing, and at any such later time reasonably requested
by Buyer, Parent shall deliver to the Buyer a duly executed Internal Revenue
Service Form 8023 and any corresponding forms identified by Buyer under
applicable state or local Law (collectively, the " _Section 338 Election
Forms_ ") with respect to each such election, and in each case such form
shall or shall not be filed as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion.
Buyer shall provide Parent with notice of the filing of each such election at
least ten (10) days after the filing of each such election and on March 1,
2008 Buyer shall provide Parent with a complete list of each 338(h)(10)
Election made, the Target Company or Target Subsidiary for which made and the
jurisdiction in which made. In the event that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement fail to qualify for treatment under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code or any analogous provision of state or local law in whole or in part,
Parent and the Sellers shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold
the Buyer harmless from any Tax detriment suffered by the Buyer to the extent
such failure to qualify is caused by Parent or its Affiliates. A failure to
qualify for treatment under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or an analogous
provision of state or local law is "caused by Parent or its Affiliates" only
if such failure is caused in whole or in part by any one or more of (i) a
failure of the Parent to timely provide valid and properly executed Section
338 Election Forms, or (ii) any breach of _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.5_ or
_Section 4.9(n)_.

Section 10.8 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price paid to RAHI and
paid to RASL shall be allocated among the assets of any Target Company treated
as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and among the
assets of any Target Subsidiary with respect to which a 338(h)(10) election
has been made, as reasonably determined by Buyer and consented to by Parent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, in accordance with Sections 338
and 1060 of the Code and any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign
law, as appropriate. Such allocations shall be set forth on a schedule to be
prepared by the Buyer and delivered to Parent within 90 days after the
determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_. Parent
shall have 20 days following delivery of the allocations schedule to him to
give written notice to Buyer (which notice shall contain reasonable supporting
details) that Parent disputes the allocations set forth on such schedule. If
Parent does not respond to Buyer within 20 days following delivery of the
allocation schedule, Parent shall be deemed to have consented to the
allocation set forth on such schedule. With respect to any items to
be included on the allocations schedule as to which the Buyer and Parent are
unable to agree, the allocations proposed by the Buyer shall be reflected on
the allocations schedule provided that the Neutral Accountant determines that
such allocation is reasonable. Buyer shall pay one half of the cost of any
review by the Neutral Accountant under this _Section 10.8(d)_ and Parent
shall bear the other half of such cost. Parent and its Affiliates and Buyer
and its Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and
claims for refund) consistent with such allocation.



 

68 Section 10.9 _Tax Refunds and Credits_. Any Tax refunds that are received by
Buyer or any Target Company or Target Subsidiary, and any amounts credited
against Tax to which Buyer or any Target Company or Target Subsidiary becomes
entitled, that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than refunds
resulting from a carry back of net operating losses or other tax attributes
to the Pre-closing Tax Period with respect to any Tax Return that is not a
Group Tax Return which Buyer may carry-back only with Parents written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and not to be withheld
if such Tax losses or other Tax attributes cannot be carried forward in lieu
of being carried back) shall be for the account of Parent, and Buyer shall pay
over to Parent any such refund or the amount of any such credit
within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto, net of the Tax
and other costs incurred in connection therewith.

Section 10.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales and transfer taxes, recording
charges and similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of the sale and
transfer of the Leased Real Property or Owned Real Property, tangible
personal property and intangible personal property to Buyer (collectively,
the " _Transfer Taxes_ "), together with any reasonable out of pocket expenses
directly related thereto and any interest, penalties or additions to such
Transfer Taxes, shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Parent. Parent and
Buyer shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms
as necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable
laws in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes, and shall
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible under such
laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in connection therewith.

ARTICLE XI

TERMINATION

Section 11.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated as
provided below:

(a) Buyer, Parent and the Sellers may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

(b) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Parent at
any time prior to the Closing in the event (A) Parent or the Sellers have
within the then previous ten business days given Buyer any notice pursuant to
_Section 5.5(a)_ above and (B) the development that is the subject of such
notice has had a Material Adverse Effect;

(c) Unless Buyer has materially breached any of the provisions of this
Agreement, which breach has not been cured, Buyer may terminate this Agreement
by giving written notice to Parent at any time prior to the Closing in the
event Parent or any Seller has breached any material representation, warranty,
or covenant contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties in  _Article IV_ above) in any material respect, Buyer has
notified Parent of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a
period of thirty days after the notice of breach;

(d) Unless Parent or any of the Sellers have materially breached any of the
provisions of this Agreement, which breach has



 

69 not been cured, Parent or any of the Sellers may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to Buyer at any time prior to the Closing in the event
Buyer has breached any material representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement in any material respect, Parent has notified Buyer
of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty days after the notice of breach;

(e) Parent or any of the Sellers may terminate this Agreement immediately on
the date following the last day of the Marketing Period if Buyer has breached
its obligation to give effect to a Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and, at
the time of such breach, all of the conditions in _Section 7.1_ would have
been satisfied (other than conditions with respect to actions the respective
Parties will take at the Closing itself) if Buyer fulfilled its obligations to
give effect to a Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3_; and

(f) Either Parent or Buyer may terminate this Agreement if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before Termination Date (provided that
the Termination Date shall be extended to the end of the Marketing Period if
the Marketing Period commenced before the original Termination Date) and the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(f)_
shall not have breached its obligations under this Agreement in any manner
that shall have proximately caused the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on or before the Termination Date.

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.1_ above, all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other
Party (except for any liability of any Party as a result of a knowing breach
of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the confidentiality
provisions contained in _Section 5.4_ above shall survive termination and the
provisions of _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ (and all related definitions)
shall survive.

Section 11.3 _Fees_. If (A) Parent or any of the Sellers terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_ or (B) Parent or any of the Sellers
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_, then Buyer shall pay
$100,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") to Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) business days following such
termination). If Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee (in whole or in part)
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 11.3_ within the time period specified in
this _Section 11.3_, Buyer shall pay the reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent in
connection with any action, including lawsuit, taken to collect payment of any
such unpaid amount, together with interest on such unpaid amount at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street
Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date the Termination Fee was
required to be paid until the date of the actual payment;  _provided_ , that
if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final non-appealable
order that Buyer (and the guarantors of Buyers obligations under this
_Section 11.3_) does not owe the Termination Fee, Parent shall not be
entitled to the amounts described in this sentence in any such action.
Parents and the Sellers right to terminate this Agreement and receive the
Termination Fee (as well as the costs, expenses and interest described above)
from Buyer as described in this _Section 11.3_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates against Buyer and any of its
Affiliates for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of this
Agreement by Buyer and the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, no Person shall
have any rights or obligations under any Equity Financing Commitments or
limited guarantees entered into in connection with this Agreement.

law principles thereof. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of

Delaware, and the appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals in such
courts, for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to

not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in
such courts, and further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or

proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in the courts of the State of Delaware sitting in New Castle County or

unconditionally waives any right to a trial by jury with respect to any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transaction
contemplated hereby.

Section 12.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement
or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.



 

73 Section 12.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.

Section 12.11 _Expenses_. Buyer and Parent, on its own behalf and on behalf of
the Sellers and the Target Companies and Target Subsidiaries, each will bear
its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in _Section 10.10_ above,
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and
charges (including any reasonable out of pocket expenses related thereto and
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement
shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Parent when due, and Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate and shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if
required by applicable law, the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

Companies and Target Subsidiaries will not comply with the provisions of any
bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 12.13 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. The word "including" shall mean "including without
limitation". 

Section 12.14 _Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules_. The
Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules identified in this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

Section 12.15 _Specific Performance_. Parent and the Sellers agree that
irreparable damage would occur to Buyer in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements were not performed by
Parent and the Sellers in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by Parent or the Sellers. It is accordingly agreed that
Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by Parent and/or the Sellers and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in courts of the State of Delaware
sitting in New Castle County and the United States District Court of Delaware,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer is entitled at law
or in equity.

(a) Parent and the Sellers shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer



 

74 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
courts of the State of Delaware sitting in New Castle County and the United
States District Court of Delaware only to prevent breaches of or enforce
compliance with those covenants of Buyer that require Buyer to (x) use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain the Committed Debt Financing
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters, including, without limitation, the
covenants set forth in _Section 5.6(a)_ and (y) effect the Closing pursuant
to _Section 2.3_, if, in the case of this clause (y), the financing provided
for in the Debt Commitment Letters (and, if Alternative Financing is being
used, pursuant to the Alternative Financing) is available to be drawn down by
Buyer pursuant the terms of the applicable agreements but is not so
drawn down solely as a result of Buyer refusing to do so in breach of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not Parent and the Sellers
are entitled to seek injunctions or specific performance pursuant to the
provisions of the preceding sentence or otherwise, if the Closing does not
occur, in no event will Parent or the Sellers be entitled to monetary damages
in excess of $100,000,000 in the aggregate, plus the costs, expenses and
interest referred to in _Section 11.3_, inclusive of the Termination Fee,
for losses or damages arising from or in connection with breaches of this
Agreement by Buyer or their respective representatives or Affiliates, or
arising from any other claim or cause of action under this Agreement.
