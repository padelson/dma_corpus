this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the Company and (ii) the
Appraisal Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger

Company Stockholders will agree to take specified actions in furtherance of
the Merger (the "Stockholder Agreement"); and

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VI, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At and following the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York
10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth
in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
law) waived on such specified day, then the Closing shall take place on the
first business day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ As soon as practicable on the Closing Date,
the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed by the Company in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time"). ##### Table of Contents

  

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as set forth in Exhibit A and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the certification of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable law.

 

(b) The bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except that references to
the name of Sub shall be replaced by the name of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

 

 _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
(including Company Restricted Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(b) and the Appraisal Shares) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive $37.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As provided in
Section 2.02(h), the right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any
withholding that is required under applicable tax law.

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), but 



 

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the
Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt
written notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration. On or prior to the Effective Time and
from time to time thereafter, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within three business days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record
of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder
thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to
this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as
provided in this Article II.



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares represented by such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that any such investment
shall be in U.S. government or other investment grade securities, in each case
with maturities of not more than one year. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect thereto.

(h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

ARTICLE III

 

 _Representations and Warranties_

 

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set
forth (i) in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC subsequent to
September 30, 2009 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(the "Filed Company SEC Documents") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed
Company SEC Documents in any risk factors section or elsewhere to the extent
that such disclosures are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) in
the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement (which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered Sections contained in this
Agreement and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify and
apply to other Sections in this Agreement to the extent that it is readily
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other Sections) (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows: 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to use
its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate
its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted, except where the failure
to have such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations or approvals
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing individually or in the aggregate
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, complete and accurate copies of its Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and its
Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws") and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date of this Agreement.

(b) _Subsidiaries._  Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each
Subsidiary of the Company and its jurisdiction of organization. All the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, claims, charges, mortgages,
encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens"), and free of any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other
equity interests, except for (i) transfer restrictions imposed by applicable
securities laws or regulations and (ii) Liens on such shares of capital stock,
voting securities or other equity interests in favor of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other
equity interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in,
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, limited liability
company, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.

(c) _Capital Structure._ (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 300,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). At
the close of business on September 22, 2010, (A) 98,805,059 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including 542,637 Company Restricted
Shares), (B) 4,868,329 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company
in its treasury, (C) 8,690,858 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
outstanding Company Stock Options, (D) 7,349 Company Performance Units were
issued



 

5 ##### Table of Contents

  

 and outstanding pursuant to the Company 2006 Shareholder Value Incentive
Plan (as amended through January 24, 2008) (the "Company SVI Plan"), (E) no
more than 8,100 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable pursuant to
currently outstanding elections under the Company Management Incentive Plan,
(F) no more than 20,000 shares of Company Common Stock were issuable pursuant
to currently outstanding elections under the Company Management Bonus Plan,
(G) 36,187 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to Company Common Stock
units under the Companys Deferred Compensation Plans for Non-Employee
Directors and (H) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding or were held by the Company as treasury shares. Except as set
forth above in this Section 3.01(c)(i), at the close of business on September
22, 2010, no shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
There are no outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on transfer, stock appreciation
rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights to receive shares
of Company Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights (other than
Company Stock Options, Company Performance Units and the Company Restricted
Shares and rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock under the
Companys Deferred Compensation Plans for Non-Employee Directors or the
Company Management Bonus Plan) that are linked to the value of Company Common
Stock (collectively, "Company Stock-Based Awards").

(ii) Section 3.01(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a summary, as of September 22, 2010, of all outstanding options to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, "Company Stock Options") under
the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject thereto and the weighted average exercise prices thereof.

(iii) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide Parent with a complete and accurate list, as of the date
of this Agreement, of (A) all outstanding Company Stock Options under the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject thereto, the grant dates, expiration dates, exercise or base
prices (if applicable) and vesting schedules thereof and the names of the
holders thereof, (B) all shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
as of the relevant time but were subject to vesting or other forfeiture
restrictions or were subject to a right of repurchase by the Company at a
fixed purchase price as of such time (shares so subject, the "Company
Restricted Shares") under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the grant and
issuance dates, expiration dates, vesting schedules and repurchase price (if
any) thereof and the names of the holders thereof and (C) all outstanding
performance units with respect to performance of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company Performance Units") under the Company SVI
Plan or otherwise, the target and maximum dollar amounts subject thereto, the
grant dates, expiration dates, vesting schedules and descriptions of the
performance criteria subject thereto and the names of the holders thereof. All
(1) Company Restricted Shares, (2) Company Stock Options and (3) Company
Performance Units are evidenced by stock option agreements, restricted stock
agreements, performance unit agreements or other award agreements, in each
case in the forms set forth in Section 3.01(c)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and no stock option agreement, restricted stock agreement,
performance unit agreement or other award agreement contains terms that are
inconsistent with or in addition to such forms. Each grant of a Company Stock
Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such
Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the "Grant Date") by
all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the
Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary
number of votes, and the award agreement governing such grant (if any) was
delivered to the recipient of such award, each such grant was made in all
material respects in accordance with the terms of the applicable compensation
plan or arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act and all other applicable
laws and regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange, the per share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was
equal to the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the
applicable Grant Date and each such grant was properly accounted for in
accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes)
of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Documents in accordance with
the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. The Company has not knowingly
granted, and there is not, and has not been, any Company policy or practice to
grant, Company

 Stock Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of Company Stock
Options with, the release or other public announcement of material information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their financial
results or prospects. Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an

the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the
Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or any applicable
similar law and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of
any Company Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing, has engaged

employment on or following the Effective Time) will (A) entitle any
Participant to severance, termination, retention, change in control or
similar compensation or benefits, (B) accelerate the time of payment or

 Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom
access previously granted to any such person or its Representatives. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the two immediately preceding sentences by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal by such party, and which
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date of this Agreement and was
made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may, if its Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)
participate in discussions regarding the terms of such Takeover Proposal and
the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives).

 

The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether or
not in writing) from any person with respect to any (i) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise) of any business
or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any person (or the stockholders of any person) or
group of shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such shares of capital stock, voting securities or other
equity interests) representing 15% or more of the voting power of the Company,
(iv) transaction in which any person (or the stockholders of any person) shall
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the
Company Common Stock or (v) combination of the foregoing (in each case, other
than the Merger).

The term "Superior Proposal" means any legally binding bona fide written offer
made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a
parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such
third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, all or
substantially all of the shares of Company Common Stock or substantially all
of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on
terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of
view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including the legal,
financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal and the
identity of the third party or group making the proposal) and this Agreement
(including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement), and
(ii) that is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed,
reasonably likely to receive all governmental approvals on a timely basis and
otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms and conditions

(b) (i) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (A) (1) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (2) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (A)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would be reasonably
likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected
to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or
that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to fail to comply with
this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
4.02(a)).

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 4.02(b)(i), at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless (A) the Company has
provided prior written notice to Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (a "Notice
of Adverse Recommendation"), which notice shall specify the reasons therefor
and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, include the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the third
party or group making the Superior Proposal) and attach a copy of the most
current draft of any written agreement relating thereto, (B) the Company has
negotiated in good faith (including by complying with its obligations
under Section 4.02(b)(iv)) with Parent with respect to any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five business days
following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Adverse Recommendation (it being
understood and agreed that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, any amendment
to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Adverse Recommendation and an additional three business day period from the
date of such notice) and (C) taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure by it to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and, in the case
of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal continues to meet the
definition of the term "Superior Proposal".

(iii) Notwithstanding Section 4.02(b)(i), at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a Takeover Proposal which the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 4.02(b)(iii), and any purported termination pursuant to this
Section 4.02(b)(iii) shall be void, unless (A) the Company has not breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, including in this Section 4.02, such
that the conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) could not then be
satisfied, (B) concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
termination fee payable pursuant to Section 5.06(b), (C) the Company has
provided prior written notice to Parent that the Company intends to terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement

 with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"),
which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the third party or group making such
Superior Proposal) and attach a copy of the definitive agreement proposed to
be entered into with respect to such Superior Proposal, (D) the Company has
negotiated in good faith (including by complying with its obligations under
Section 4.02(b)(iv)) with Parent with respect to any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least five business days following
receipt by Parent of such Notice of Superior Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and an additional three
business day period from the date of such notice) and (E) taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company,
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that such Superior Proposal continues to meet the
definition of the term "Superior Proposal" and the failure by it to terminate
this Agreement to enter into the definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law.

(iv) The Company shall keep confidential during the term of this Agreement
any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, other than
in the event of any amendment to this Agreement or to the extent otherwise
required to be disclosed by applicable law.

and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally

reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover
Proposal, inquiry or proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent informed in
all material respects of the status and details (including any change to the
terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or proposal and any
discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions
thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material
(including draft agreements) relating to any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry
or proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its Affiliates (or its or
their Representatives), on the one hand, and the person making such Takeover
Proposal, inquiry or proposal (or its Representatives), on the other hand,
other than correspondence or other written material that does not relate to
any material term or condition of such Takeover Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from (x)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel) failure to
so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option;

converted into an amount in cash equal to $1,000, multiplied by a fraction,

 performance period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in accordance with the
terms of the Company SVI Plan, any such payments described in this Section
5.04(a)(iii) will be reduced to the extent that they, when combined with any
other payments, benefits or other economic entitlements to the recipient,
would cause the recipient to be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999
of the Code;

 

(iv) at the Effective Time, all Company Common Stock units credited to the
account of each Participant under the Companys Deferred Compensation Plans

and such payment shall be made in accordance with the terms of such plans; and

 

(v) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as the Company and

Company Stock-Based Award (or former holder of a Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Share, Company Performance Unit or Company Stock-Based Award) or
any current or former participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire

Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary

the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation and
Insurance._ (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the
obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate

Agreement), without further action, as of the Effective Time and such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the extension of the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance policies (complete and accurate copies of which have been
heretofore made available to Parent) (the "Existing DandO Policy") in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person currently covered by the Existing DandO Policy for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, on terms with respect to such coverage (including as
coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable
to such persons than those of the Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ that the
Company shall not be permitted to pay more than $2,500,000 in the aggregate to
obtain such coverage. If the Company shall fail to obtain such extension of
the Existing DandO



 

35 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Policy, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain the Existing DandO
Policy for a period of six years after the Effective Time; _provided_ that
Parent or one of its Affiliates may (i) substitute therefor policies of
Parent or one of its Affiliates or (ii) obtain such extended reporting period
coverage through a "tail" insurance policy (to be effective as of the
Effective Time), in each case containing terms with respect to coverage
(including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no
less favorable to such directors and officers from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating than the carrier of the Existing DandO Policy
as the date of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.05(c), Parent or
its Affiliate shall not be obligated to pay in the aggregate an annual premium
for insurance that exceeds 150% of the annual premiums payable by the Company
for coverage during calendar year 2009 under the Existing DandO Policy
(which premiums for such year are set forth in Section 5.05(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule). It is understood and agreed that in the event the annual
premium for the coverage set forth in Section 5.05(c) would at any time exceed
such 150% amount, Parent or its Affiliate shall be obligated to provide the
maximum available coverage as may be obtained for such 150% amount from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating than the carrier of
the Existing DandO Policy as of the date of this Agreement.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
