receipt and legal sufficiency of which they hereby acknowledge, and intending
to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

 



   



 

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

 



 

 _1.1 The Merger_. Upon the performance of all covenants and obligations
and the satisfaction and fulfillment of all conditions to the obligations of
the parties contained herein (other than such covenants, obligations and
conditions as shall have been waived in accordance with the terms hereof and
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of all conditions at the
Closing), and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as
amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Merger; the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease; and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of
the State of Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser. The name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be the same name as the name Company as of
the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 _1.2 Effective Time_. The Merger shall be effected by the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the provisions of Section 251(c) of the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective at the time set forth in the Certificate of Merger, which
shall be filed contemporaneously with the closing conducted pursuant to
_Section_ _1.9_ (the " _Closing_ "). The time and date when the Merger shall
become effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

 



 

 _1.3 Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 _1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_.
Unless otherwise determined by the Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, at
the Effective Time (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit D_ ; and (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
E_.

 



 

 _1.5 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Unless
otherwise determined by the Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, (a) the
directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time,
together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected, shall
serve as the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and
(b) the officers of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be appointed,
shall serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 _1.5A _ _Other Actions to be Taken at the Closing_. At the Closing,
concurrent with the Effective Time, the following shall occur:

 



 

 



   



 

(i) the Purchaser shall deliver to the Minority Common Unit Holder the Per
Share Cash Amount, Per Share Stock Amount and Per Share Warrant Consideration
which the Minority Common Unit Holder would be entitled to receive in the
Merger if each Minority Common Unit were instead one share of Company Stock,
and the Company shall cause the Minority Common Unit Holder to assign to the
Company all of its right, title and interest in and to the Minority Common
Units free and clear of all Liens; _provided_ , _however_ , that no payment
pursuant to this _Section 1.5A(i)_ shall result in a duplication of payment in
respect of any Minority Common Unit pursuant to _Section 1.6_ ;

 



 

(ii) the Company shall cause GW Services, LLC (the " _Company Subsidiary_
") to acquire all outstanding preferred interests of the Company Subsidiary in
consideration for the payment of 135% of the Principal Amount of the Preferred
Interests in the Company Subsidiary (not to exceed $39,200,000) and any
accrued but unpaid Preferred Return (as such capitalized terms are defined in
the Company Subsidiary's operating agreement) provided that the amounts of
such accrued but unpaid Preferred Return shall have been accrued on a basis
consistent with the accruals for such amounts as contained in the Financial
Statements, and the Purchaser shall fund such acquisition;

 



 

(iii) the Company shall redeem the Company's Series B Junior Subordinated
Debentures in an aggregate principal amount of $12,500,000 in accordance with
their terms (which aggregate principal amount shall be redeemed for
$12,250,000 (plus interest accrued thereon) if the Effective Time is on or
prior to December 28, 2016) at the expense of the Purchaser (provided that the
amounts of any accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall have been accrued on
a basis consistent with the accruals for such amounts as contained in the
Financial Statements), and the Purchaser shall fund such redemption, and in
the event that any Series B Junior Subordinated Debentures on the date hereof
shall have been converted prior to the Closing into Trust Preferred Securities
of Glacier Water Trust I, such Trust Preferred Securities shall be repurchased

under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 23, 2012,
between the Company Subsidiary and City National Bank, as administrative agent
and as the Required Lender (as defined thereunder), as amended through April

 _1.6 Merger Consideration_.

 



 

 _(a) Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of shares of Company
Stock, and subject to the deposit into escrow described in _Section_ _1.8_ ,
each share of Company Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares or any shares of
Company Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive the following consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):
(i) the Per Share Cash Amount, (ii) the Per Share Stock Amount and (iii) the
Per Share Warrant Consideration, in each case payable to the holder thereof,
without interest, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such Company Stock or an affidavit with respect thereto, in each
case in accordance with _Section _ _1.7_. As of the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Stock so converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate or certificates representing any such shares of
Company Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except to
receive the Merger Consideration applicable thereto in accordance with this
Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

 _(b) Minority Common Units_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary on its part to cause the following: as of the Effective Time, each
LLC common unit of the Company Subsidiary that is held by a member or other
investor in the Company Subsidiary other than the Company and that is listed
on _Schedule 1.6(b)_ hereto (each such unit, a " _Minority Common Unit_ ")
shall be cancelled and terminated in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Company Subsidiary in exchange for the right to receive the
payment described in _Section 1.5A(i)_. The LLC common units of the Company
Subsidiary held by the Company or any other Subsidiaries of the Company shall
remain outstanding at and immediately following the Effective Time and without
any consideration or other payment to the Company or any other Affiliate of
the Company therefor.

 



 

 _(c) Stock Options_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall take all actions necessary on its part to cause the
following: as of the Effective Time, each Stock Option outstanding at the
Effective Time shall either be canceled or terminated and such cancellation or
termination shall be evidenced by an Option Cancellation Agreement duly
executed by the applicable Optionholder and each such Optionholder shall
receive, in exchange therefor, subject to _Section 1.6(c)(ii)_, the
difference between the Per Share Closing Consideration Value and the per share
exercise or strike price of such Stock Option (such difference, the " _Option
Value_ "), which Option Value shall be allocated to such Optionholder by
treating such Optionholder as if such Optionholder owns a number of shares of
Company Stock determined by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Stock Option _by_ (y) the quotient obtained by dividing
such Option Value by the Per Share Closing Consideration Value (each such
share of Company Stock resulting from such allocation, an " _Option Allocated
Share_ "), such that each Option Allocated Share shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Amount, the Per Share Stock Amount and the
Per Share Warrant Consideration as if such Option Allocated Share were a share
of Company Stock as described in _Section 1.6(a)_ (the " _Company Option
Consideration_ "). Thereafter, without impairing the rights of the
Optionholders to receive the payments to the extent set forth herein, the
Optionholders shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to have any further right
or entitlement to acquire any Company Stock or any shares of capital stock of
the Purchaser or the Surviving Company under the cancelled or terminated Stock
Options.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) The Purchaser will direct the Exchange Agent to withhold from the
cash payments made with respect to Stock Options held by any employees of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of paying the
withheld amounts to such Optionholders, all withholding Taxes related to the
amount received by such Optionholders, such amounts to be disbursed to the
Surviving Company by the Exchange Agent. After the Closing, the Purchaser will
timely file, or will cause the Surviving Company to timely file, any related
returns of such withholding Taxes and will timely remit, or cause the timely
remission of, these withheld amounts to the Governmental Authorities entitled
to receive the same. It is the express intention of the parties hereto that
the aggregate Company Option Consideration payable to an Optionholder shall be
reduced to the extent of any withholding Taxes. The Company and the
Stockholder Representative agree to provide the Purchaser with such
information as it may reasonably require in order to calculate any withholding
Taxes.

 



 

 _(d) No Additional Payments_. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary: (i) in no event will the
Purchaser be required to pay more than the Closing Cash Consideration or to
issue more than the Closing Stock Consideration or the Aggregate Warrant
Consideration in the Merger; and (ii) all calculations described in this
_Section_ _1.6_ will be calculated and rounded to five decimal places.

 



 

 _(e) Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Section_ _1.6_ and as
otherwise provided in this Agreement:

of the Closing Stock Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.6(e)(vi), if
inclusion of the Transaction Expense Exclusion in the value of the Closing
Stock Consideration would require the Purchaser to obtain stockholder approval
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Nasdaq
Marketplace Rule 5635 and such stockholder approval has not been obtained,
then the Transaction Expense Exclusion shall be omitted from the definition of
Closing Stock Consideration and shall instead be included in the calculation
of Closing Cash Consideration as an addition and not a reduction to the

right to use) real or personal property, or a combination thereof, which
liabilities are required to be classified and accounted for under GAAP as
capital leases; (D) all liabilities for the reimbursement of any obligor on
any letter of credit, banker's acceptance or similar credit transaction, to
the extent of the obligation secured, and all liabilities as obligor,
guarantor or otherwise, to the extent of the obligation secured; (E) current
net obligations under any interest rate swap or other agreement for the
purpose of hedging risks related to interest rates, commodity prices or other

liabilities or obligations of the Company the disposition of which is provided
for in _Section 1.5A_. Neither the principal amount of the Preferred Interests
and other amounts payable with respect thereto in accordance with _Section
1.5A(ii)_ nor any amounts which may be payable to ISB-In-Store Bagging Machine
Company, LLC (" _ISB_ ") in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement shall
be Company Debt hereunder).

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares of Company Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (B)

exercise of Stock Options (as determined in a manner consistent with the
determination of Option Value in _Section_ _1.6(c)(i)_ ), (C) the aggregate
number of Minority Common LLC Units and (D) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Stock issued by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
_Section 4.5(g)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(ix) " _Per Share Cash Amount_ " means an amount in cash equal to the
result of _dividing_ (A) the Closing Cash Consideration _by_ (B) the number of
shares of Fully-Diluted Company Stock.

the Closing Consideration _divided_ _by_ the Fully-Diluted Company Stock.

connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by or in
connection with this Agreement (including legal, accounting, investment
banking, finders and advisory fees and expenses); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses described in this clause (A)
shall be excluded from Transaction Expenses (as such term is used in the
_Section 1.6(e)(iii)_ definition of Closing Cash Consideration), up to a
maximum exclusion of One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($1,750,000) (any amount so excluded from the Transaction Expenses being the "
_Transaction Expense Exclusion_ "), and (B) any compensation, expenses, fees,
payments or other liabilities incurred or to be incurred or paid or to be paid
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of their employees, officers,
directors or the holders of any of their securities that are related to the
Merger or contingent upon the consummation of the Merger other than bonuses in
the form of Company Stock (the " _Transaction Bonuses_ ").

 



 

 _(f) Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(i) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to the Purchaser its good faith written estimate (the "
_Estimated Statement_ ") of the Transaction Expenses (such value, the "
_Estimated Transaction Expenses_"), the Transaction Expense Exclusion (the "
_Estimated Transaction Expense Exclusion_ ") and the Company Debt, if any
(such value, the " _Estimated Closing Debt_ "), which the Purchaser shall have

representatives) the personnel, books and records utilized in preparing the
Estimated Statement. For purposes of determining the Closing Consideration

(ii) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a proposed statement of
the Transaction Expenses, Transaction Expense Exclusion and Company Debt
incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date and the resulting calculation
of the Closing Consideration Value (the " _Proposed Statement_ "). The
Transaction Expenses and Company Debt shall be prepared from the Company's
books and records as of the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(iii) The Stockholder Representative shall notify the Purchaser in writing
(the " _Objection Notice_") within fifteen (15) days after receiving the
Proposed Statement (such period, the " _Objection Period_ ") if the
Stockholder Representative disagrees with the Proposed Statement, or any part
thereof, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement, the dollar amounts involved and the Stockholder Representative's
resulting calculation of the Transaction Expenses, Transaction Expense
Exclusion, Company Debt and Closing Consideration Value. The Purchaser shall
give the Stockholder Representative (and its representatives) reasonable
access during normal business hours of the Purchaser to the personnel, books
and records of the Purchaser (and the Surviving Corporation) in order to
assist the Stockholder Representative (and its representatives) in the
preparation of the Objection Notice. If no Objection Notice is received by the
Purchaser within the Objection Period, the Purchaser's calculation of the
Transaction Expenses, Transaction Expense Exclusion, Company Debt and Closing
Consideration Value shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and the
Proposed Statement shall be deemed the "Actual Statement"; provided that, if
an Objection Notice is timely delivered under this _Section 1.6(f)_ , the
numbers stated in the Proposed Statement shall be revised to reflect the
resolution of any disagreements stated in such Objection Notice, in accordance
with this _Section 1.6(f)_ , and such revised statement shall be deemed the "
_Actual Statement_ ".

 



 

(iv) Upon receipt by the Purchaser of any Objection Notice, the
Stockholder Representative, the Purchaser and their representatives shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect to the
Transaction Expenses, Transaction Expense Exclusion, Company Debt and Closing
Consideration Value set forth in the Objection Notice. To the extent that the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are unable to agree with respect
to the foregoing within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Purchaser of
the Objection Notice (which fifteen (15) day period may be extended by written
agreement of the Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative), the Purchaser
and the Stockholder Representative shall (A) promptly select a mutually
acceptable internationally recognized accounting firm with no material
relationship to the Purchaser, the Company or the Stockholder Representative
and (B) submit their dispute to such accounting firm for a binding resolution
of all matters which remain in dispute with respect to the Objection Notice.
The accounting firm so selected shall be instructed by the parties to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to notify the parties of its determination
concerning the matter(s) submitted to it for a resolution within thirty (30)
days after its appointment. The determination of the accounting firm shall be
final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the accounting firm in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by the
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

 



   



 

(v) In the event that the Transaction Expenses in the Actual Statement
differ by more than $25,000 from the Estimated Transaction Expenses in the
Estimated Statement, or the Transaction Expense Exclusion in the Actual
Statement differs by more than $25,000 from the Estimated Transaction Expense
Exclusion in the Estimated Statement, or the Company Debt in the Actual
Statement differs by more than $25,000 from the Estimated Closing Debt in the
Estimated Statement, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the
amounts in the Actual Statement. If any adjustment is to be made in favor of
the Purchaser, the Escrow Agent shall remit to the Purchaser from the Escrow
Fund shares of Purchaser Common Stock in an amount necessary to reflect such
adjustment (at the Average Share Price at the time the proposed instructions
are given to the Escrow Agent). If an adjustment is to be made in favor of the
Company Holders, the Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
Actual Statement becomes final and binding, make a cash payment to the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of and for the distribution to, all of
the Company Holders pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ in the amount necessary to
make such adjustment.

 



 

 _1.7 Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
cause its transfer agent, who will serve as its exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), to distribute to holders of record of Company Stock as of
the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for its
use in effecting the surrender of the certificates representing the Company
Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration applicable thereto, in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "). Upon surrender of a certificate or certificates representing
any Company Stock to the Exchange Agent (other than certificates representing
shares of Company Stock or equity interests in the Company Subsidiary held by
the Company or any of its other Subsidiaries) together with a properly
executed Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to amounts deposited into escrow pursuant to
_Section_ _1.8_ , (i) one or more shares of Purchaser Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.6(a)_ , (ii) a check for the portion of the Closing Cash
Consideration such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
1.6(a)_ , and the cash consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ _1.7_ _(d)_ and (iii) Warrants
representing the aggregate Per Share Warrant Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable for the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration or pursuant to _Section _ _1.7_ _(d)_. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, one or more shares of Purchaser Common Stock
evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and a check for the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ _1.7_ _(d)_ may be issued with respect to such Company Stock to such
a transferee if the certificate or certificates representing such shares of
Company Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) If any certificate or certificates representing any Company Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such certificate or certificates to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such certificate or certificates, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or
certificates representing any such Company Stock, the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Stock, formerly
represented thereby and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each case, pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of shares of Company Stock or Minority Common Units such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock or Minority Common Units, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Purchaser, and such amounts shall be delivered by the Purchaser to the
applicable taxing authority.

 



 

(d) No certificates of Purchaser Common Stock representing fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock, Stock Options or
Minority Common Units, as applicable, and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder
of the Purchaser or a holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Stock, Stock Options or Minority Common Units exchanged pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Purchaser Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Stock, Stock
Options or Minority Common Units delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i)
such fractional part of a share of Purchaser Common Stock multiplied by (ii)
the Average Share Price. As promptly as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will deposit
such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to
forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

 



   



 

 _1.8 Issuances into Escrow_.

 



 

(a) When making the issuances and payments required by _Section_ _1.6_ ,
and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser shall withhold from the Company Holders (on a pro rata basis
according to their respective interests therein) and deliver to the Escrow
Agent (as defined in the Escrow Agreement referred to below) Seventy One
percent (71%) of the Closing Stock Consideration payable to each such Company
Holder (the " _Escrow Fund_ "), to be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "). The shares that are part of the Escrow Fund shall be issued in
the name of the Escrow Agent, as escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) David Shladovsky shall, by virtue of the Merger and as of the
Effective Time, be irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact and authorized to
act for and on behalf of any or all of the Company Holders (with full power of
substitution in the premises) with respect to all matters arising in
connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or any consideration
payable in connection with this Agreement (the above-named representative, or
any subsequent representative appointed under the Escrow Agreement, the "
_Stockholder Representative_ "). Such appointment may be changed as provided
in the Escrow Agreement. Each of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely on such appointment and treat the
Stockholder Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each
Company Holder for all such purposes. Each Company Holder by receiving Merger
Consideration acknowledges and agrees that such appointment is irrevocable and
coupled with an interest. The adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
Merger by the Stockholders, and the execution and delivery of a completed
Letter of Transmittal by the Stockholders and the receipt of the consideration
payable pursuant to _Article I_ shall constitute the approval of the Company
Holders of the Escrow Agreement and of all the arrangements relating thereto,
including, without limitation, the placement of the applicable consideration
into escrow and the appointment of the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(c) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. Each
Company Holder shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Stockholder Representative, to the fullest extent permitted in law or
equity, from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
obligations, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses, and expenses of investigation and defenses, imposed on,
sustained, suffered, incurred or paid without gross negligence or bad faith on
the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of his, her or its duties hereunder.

 



 

 



   



 

 _1.9 Closing_. Consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at the offices of Smith,
Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell and Jernigan, L.L.P. as of the Effective
Time after all of the conditions set forth in _Article V_ and _Article VI_
shall have been satisfied or waived (such specified or other time and date,
the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



 

 _1.10 Transaction Documents_. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Transaction Documents_ " shall mean, collectively, this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Voting Agreements, the Lock-Up Agreements, the Warrants, the
Option Cancellation Agreement and all agreements, instruments, certificates
and other documents executed or delivered in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document.

 



 

 _1.11 Dissenters' Rights_. Any shares of Company Stock which immediately
prior to the Effective Time are held by Stockholders who have properly
exercised and perfected, and have not withdrawn or otherwise forfeited,
dissenters' rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive any portion of the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ _1.6(a)_ above; rather, the
holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive consideration
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall withdraw or lose such
holder's dissenters' rights, such holder's shares of Company Stock thereupon
shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section_ _1.6(a)_ (subject to the deposit into
escrow pursuant to _Section_ _1.8_ ), and such shares shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares. The Company agrees that, except with the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, or as required under the DGCL, the Company will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any purchase demand by a holder of Dissenting Shares. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation from funds provided by the Purchaser (but only after the amount of
the payment required therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the DGCL).

 



 

 _1.12 Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



 

 _1.13 Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of any shares of capital stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for Company
Stock are presented to the Purchaser, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the applicable Merger Consideration.

 



 

 



   



 

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except as disclosed in the written disclosure schedule separately delivered by
the Company to the Purchaser at or prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants to the
Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows, for all purposes of which (other than
where the context clearly indicates otherwise) the term "Company" shall be
deemed to include the Company and all of its Subsidiaries:

 



 

 _2.1 Ownership of Stock and Minority Common Units_. Each Principal
Stockholder is the beneficial owner of the number of shares of Company Stock
listed opposite such Stockholder's name on _Schedule_ _2.1_. The shares of
Company Stock held by the Principal Stockholders are held free and clear of
any Liens. The Company has delivered to the Purchaser a true and correct copy
of its stockholder record as of October 4, 2016. All Minority Common Units are
held of record and beneficially by Glacier Water Holdings, LLC.

 



 

 _2.2 Existence and Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State

business as it is now being conducted and contemplated to be conducted, to own
or use the properties and assets that it purports to own or use, and to
perform all of its obligations under applicable Contracts. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
under the Laws of the State of California and each other state or other

the Company, the Purchaser and the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or
in the Disclosure Schedule shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding any investigation or examination of, or knowledge with
respect to, the subject matter thereof by or on behalf of the Merger Sub or

for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ _7.2_ based on an alleged breach of
any such representation or warranty may be brought after the expiration of the

with this _Section_ _7.1_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this

the Escrow Fund (plus any additional shares as may be issued upon any stock
split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by the Purchaser after the
Effective Time), without any act required on the part of any such Company
Holder. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Fund,
without any act required on the part of any Company Holder, will be deposited
with the Escrow Agent. The portion of the Escrow Fund contributed on behalf of
each such Company Holder shall be in proportion to the aggregate amount of
Closing Stock Consideration to which such Company Holder would otherwise be

stockholders (other than the Stockholders), employees, agents, Affiliates,
successors and assigns (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnitee_ " and collectively,

individually a " _Loss_ " and collectively " _Losses_ ") imposed on,
sustained, suffered, incurred or paid, whether in respect of third-party
claims, claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise, directly or
indirectly by the Purchaser Indemnitees, as a result of, in connection with or
arising out of (i) any breach, violation or non-fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement of the Company or the Company Holders contained in this Agreement,
any Transaction Document or any document delivered in connection herewith or
therewith, or (ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement, any Transaction
Document as of the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , for purposes of this _Section_ _7.2(b)_ _(ii)_ , any
qualifications relating to materiality, including the term "Material __
Adverse Effect," or relating to Knowledge contained in such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether such
representation or warranty was breached or inaccurate and for purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses resulting therefrom. For the purpose of
valuing any Purchaser Common Stock to be recovered by the Purchaser from the
Escrow Fund as compensation for any Losses, the Average Share Price shall be
deemed the price of such Purchaser Common Stock at the time it is to be
released from the Escrow Fund. The parties hereto acknowledge that Losses
include consequential, special, incidental and indirect damages, including
lost profits.

 



 

(c) _Indemnity by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set forth in

extent permitted in law or equity, from and against any and all _Losses_
imposed on, sustained, suffered, incurred or paid, whether in respect of
third-party claims, claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise, directly
or indirectly by the Company Indemnitees, as a result of, in connection with
or arising out of (i) any breach, violation or non-fulfillment of any covenant
or agreement of the Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, any

therewith, or (ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by the Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, any

_provided_ , _however_ , for purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_ , (A) any
qualifications relating to materiality, including the term "Material __
Adverse Effect," or relating to knowledge contained in such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether such
representation or warranty was breached or inaccurate and for purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses resulting therefrom and (B) Losses shall mean
solely (1) the diminution in value of the Closing Stock Consideration and
Aggregate Warrant Consideration received by the Company Holders, (2) expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) with respect thereto, and (3)
reasonable expenses of investigation and defense (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) with respect to Third Party Claims. Any claims
for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_ shall be brought only by
the Stockholder Representative and not by any Company Holders, whether
individually or collectively.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) _ Limitations_.

 



 

(i) The Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive source of satisfaction
of any claim made by the Purchaser Indemnitees for any Losses resulting from
the matters set forth in this _Article VII_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall limit any remedy of a Purchaser Indemnitee for (i) the
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or (ii) fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, nothing shall prohibit the Purchaser from
seeking and obtaining recourse against the Company Holders, or any of them, in
the event and to the extent that there is a misallocation in the distribution
of the Merger Consideration among the Company Holders.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Holders, on the one hand,
shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall not be required to indemnify the Company
Indemnitees, in each case in respect of any Loss subject to indemnification
under _Section_ _7.2(b)_ _(ii)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_ , as applicable,
unless and until, and only to the extent, the aggregate of all Losses subject
to indemnification under _Section_ _7.2(b)_ _(ii)_ or _Section 7.2(c)(ii)_,
as applicable, exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in the
aggregate, _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit any remedy
of a Purchaser Indemnitee or a Company Indemnitee for (i) the breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or (ii) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct.

 



 

(iii) The aggregate amount to be paid by the Purchaser to the Company
Indemnitee(s) for any Loss resulting from the matters set forth in this
_Article VII_ shall not exceed an amount equivalent to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock then in the Escrow Fund and (y) the
Average Share Price of Purchaser Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall limit any remedy of a Company Indemnitee for (i) the
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or (ii) fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful conduct. Any amounts payable by
Purchaser pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be delivered to the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of, and for distribution to, all of the Company
Holders, in each case payable in cash or in shares of Purchaser Common Stock
(valued at the Average Share Price for such shares at the time of payment) or
any combination thereof, in the Purchaser's sole discretion.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) _Stockholder Representative_. In the event that the Merger is adopted
and approved by the Stockholders, effective upon such vote, and without
further act of any Company Holder, the Stockholder Representative, for and on
behalf of the Company Holders, shall be authorized to deliver to the Purchaser
shares of Purchaser Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of
claims by any Purchaser Indemnitee, to object to such deliveries, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.
Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Company Holders. Other than the
Stockholder Representative, no Company Holder shall have any right to
intervene, take part in or otherwise delay any action related to the Escrow
Fund, including without limitation any indemnification payments to be made to
the Purchaser out of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agreement and _Section_ _1.8_
of this Agreement describe additional information regarding the rights and
duties of the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(f) _Procedures Applicable to Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) _Notice of Claims_. If at any time subsequent to the Closing, a party
or parties entitled to make a claim for indemnification hereunder (the "
_Indemnitee_ ") becomes aware of any demand or claim asserted by a third party
which gives rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement)
of any action, proceeding or investigation that may result in Losses for which
the Indemnitee believes it may be entitled to indemnification hereunder (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall forthwith give written notice
thereof to the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnitor_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying any
Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder unless
(and then solely to the extent) the Indemnitor thereby is prejudiced. The
notice shall describe the Third Party Claim (including the facts and
circumstances related thereto) in reasonable detail and the basis of the
Indemnitee's request for indemnification hereunder and, to the extent
practicable, shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Losses
that have been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee.

 



 

(ii) _Opportunity to Defend_. The Indemnitor shall have the right,
exercisable by giving written notice to the Indemnitee not later than thirty
(30) days after receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim from the
Indemnitee, to assume control of the defense, compromise and settlement of the
Third Party Claim. Upon the assumption of control by the Indemnitor as
aforesaid, the Indemnitor shall, solely at its expense, diligently proceed
with the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim, including
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, until either
(i) the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee otherwise agree, or (ii) a court of
competent jurisdiction finally determines that the Indemnitor does not have an
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee (in which event the Indemnitee shall
forthwith reimburse the Indemnitor for all amounts paid with respect to such
Third Party Claim and the defense thereof). If the Indemnitor has assumed the
defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate in
the defense thereof and shall make available to the Indemnitor all pertinent
books, records, documents and other information and all pertinent witnesses
under the Indemnitee's control and shall make such assignments and take such
other steps as in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnitor are reasonably
necessary to enable the Indemnitor to conduct such defense. In the event the
Indemnitor undertakes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee
shall nevertheless be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense
thereof with counsel of its own choice and at its own expense, and the Parties
agree to cooperate fully with one another in connection with the defense
and/or settlement thereof. From and after delivery of notice to the Indemnitee

action.

 



 

(iv) _Recovery From Third Party_. If the Indemnitee subsequently recovers
all or part of the Third Party Claim from any other Person (including any
insurance company) legally obligated to pay the claim, the Indemnitee shall

suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment. In no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(e) The parties hereto agree that payment of the Termination Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement shall be the Purchaser's and Merger Sub's exclusive
remedy for any termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_

such termination.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding approval of this Agreement and the Certificate of
Merger by the stockholders of Merger Sub and the Company, the parties hereto
agree that termination of this Agreement shall constitute mutual termination
and abandonment of the Certificate of Merger and that, upon any such
termination, neither Merger Sub nor the Company shall have any further rights
or obligations under or arising out of the Certificate of Merger; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of termination under clauses _8.1(a)_ (ii) or
(iii), no party shall be relieved of liability for its breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(ix)_ , then

(h) The Purchaser and the Company acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ _8.1_ are an integral part of the transactions

suit, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime

the Company's and the Purchaser's exclusive remedy for any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ under circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable under this _Section_ _8.1_ and is actually paid,
and after such payment the Company or the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall
have no further recourse against the other party for, or as a result of, such
termination.

Company's right to terminate this Agreement and receive the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ , and the Purchaser's right to terminate this
Agreement and receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ , shall
