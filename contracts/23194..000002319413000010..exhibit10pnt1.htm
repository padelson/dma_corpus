indemnity as provided in this Section 3.3 and assume the defense of the Claim;

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnified Party shall not, and the
Indemnifying Party shall, have the right to contest, defend, litigate or
settle such Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to be
represented by counsel at the Indemnified Party's expense, subject to the
limitations hereof, in any such contest, defense, litigation or settlement
conducted by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall lose its
right to defend and settle the Claim if it shall fail to diligently contest
and defend the Claim after written notice or demand by the Indemnified Party.
So long as the Indemnifying Party has not lost its right and/or obligation to
contest, defend, litigate and settle as herein provided, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the exclusive right to contest, defend and litigate the Claim
and shall have the exclusive right, in its discretion exercised in good faith,
and upon the advice of counsel, to settle any such matter, either before or
after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as it
deems fair and reasonable; provided, that at least five (5) Business Days
prior to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle shall
be given to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall have
consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. All expenses (including without limitation attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the foregoing
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party; provided that, if the Indemnifying
Party is the Seller, such expenses shall be paid or reimbursed to the
Indemnified Party solely out of the Indemnity Amount and the Seller will have
no obligation hereunder in excess of such amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with any settlement negotiated by an Indemnifying
Party, no Indemnified Party shall be required by an Indemnifying Party to (x)
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of
a full and complete release from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation, (y) enter into any settlement that attributes by its terms
liability or wrongdoing to the Indemnified Party, or which establishes or
acknowledges any liability of the Indemnified Party that is not satisfied by
the Indemnifying Party, or would establish or acknowledge any future
restrictions on the Indemnified Party, or (z) consent to the entry of any
judgment that does not include as a term thereof a full dismissal of the
litigation or proceeding with prejudice. No failure by an Indemnifying Party
to acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligations under this Section
3.3 shall relieve it of such obligations to the extent they exist. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to accept a tender of, or assume, the defense of a
Claim pursuant to this Section 3.3(d), or if, in accordance with the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall lose its right to contest, defend,
litigate and settle such a Claim or if there is a legal conflict, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, without prejudice to its right of
indemnification hereunder, in its discretion exercised in good faith and upon
the advice of counsel, to contest, defend and litigate such Claim, and may
settle such Claim, either before or after the initiation of litigation, at
such time and upon such terms as the Indemnified Party deems fair and
reasonable; provided, that the Indemnified Party will not settle such Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, pursuant to
this Section 3.3, the Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or
settles a Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as
hereinabove provided, the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party for the reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses of
defending, contesting, litigating and/or settling the Claim which are incurred
from time to time, forthwith following the presentation to the Indemnifying
Party of itemized bills for said attorneys' fees and other expenses; provided
that, if the Indemnifying Party is the Seller and the matter relates to a
matter subject to indemnity by Seller pursuant to clause (i) of Section 3.3(b)
(other than a breach of Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(b), 5.1(c), 5.1(d), 5.1(e),
5.1(f) or 5.1(g) hereof), such expenses shall be reimbursable to the
Indemnified Party solely out of the Indemnity Amount and the Seller will have
no obligation hereunder in excess of such amount.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(e) Subrogation. Following full indemnification as provided for hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party
with respect to all parties relating to the matter for which indemnification
has been made and the Indemnified Party agrees to fully cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in exercising such subrogation rights, insofar and only
insofar as the exercise of such subrogation rights does NOT (i) establish or
acknowledge any liability of the Indemnified Party that is not satisfied by
the Indemnifying Party, (ii) establish or acknowledge any future restrictions
on the Indemnified Party, (iii) if the Indemnifying Party is the Seller,
entitle Seller to any benefits or privileges of ownership of the Assets
attributable to periods from and after the Effective Time.

 

  

  

 

(f) Insured Losses; Recoveries from Third Parties. The amount of any damages
for which indemnification is provided under this Section 3.3, Section 7.7, or
the other provisions hereof shall be net of any duplicative amounts recovered
by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or from unaffiliated third
parties with respect to such damages. If an Indemnified Party receives an
amount under insurance coverage or from an unaffiliated third party with
respect to damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by
an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 3.3, Section 7.7, or the other
provisions hereof, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver such
amount (up to the amount of the indemnification payment made to such
Indemnified Party regarding such matter) to the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain the amount of
any payments made or costs or expenses incurred in connection with obtaining
such payment. The obligation created by this Section 3.3(f), Section 7.7, or
the other provisions hereof is an obligation to make repayment in the event
and to the extent of a recovery from a third party and shall not delay an
Indemnified Party's right to repayment from the Indemnifying Party under this
Section 3.3, Section 7.7, or the other provisions hereof.

 

  

  

 

(g) Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Buyer and Seller agree to
treat any payment made under this Section 3.3, Section 7.7, or the other
provisions hereof as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any indemnification
hereunder will be determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account any
actual tax benefits or detriments realized with respect to the damages for
which the payment under this Section 3.3, Section 7.7, or the other provisions
hereof is being made).

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

3.4 Retained Obligations. Provided that the Closing occurs, Seller shall
retain indefinitely all obligations and liabilities related to (a) the
Excluded Assets (b) all liability of Seller to third parties for personal
injury, bodily injury, illness or death to the extent occurring prior to the
Effective Time as a result of the operation of the Assets; (c) ad valorem,
property, severance and similar taxes attributable to the period of time prior
to the Effective Time retained by Seller; (d) all litigation existing or
threatened Claims as of the Closing Date, to the extent it relates to the
period of time prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, any
matters described in Schedule 5.1(g), and (e) all obligations, liabilities and
Claims relating to any pollutant, contaminant or toxic or hazardous materials
that may have originated from, or been removed from, any of the Assets which
were disposed of offsite of the Assets during the time period November 1, 2011
until Closing; for a period of two (2) years from Closing, and not thereafter,
Seller shall retain (f) all obligations and liabilities of Seller for the
payment or improper payment of royalties, overriding royalties, production
payments, net profits interests, rentals and other similar payments
attributable to Seller's interests in the Leases, Units and Wells relating to
the Assets accruing prior to the Effective Time; (g) all obligations of Seller
under the Contracts for (i) overhead charges related to periods prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) costs and expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time
for goods and services provided prior to the Effective Time, (iii) other
payment obligations that accrue and become due prior to the Effective Time,
(iv) joint interest billings and trade payables, and (vi) for alleged breach
thereof prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Retained
Obligations").

  

  

3.5 Assumed Obligations. Upon Closing, Buyer shall assume all duties,
obligations and liabilities of every kind and character with respect to the
Assets actually conveyed to Buyer at Closing or the ownership or operation
thereof (other than the Retained Obligations and other than liabilities for
which Seller is responsible for under Section 3.3(b)), whether attributable to
periods before or after the Effective Time, except as provided herein,
including, without limitation, those arising out of (a) the terms of the
Leases or Surface Interests, or the Personal Property or Assets, (b) suspense
accounts, to the extent transferred to Buyer except as to Suspense Proceeds
that should have been escheated under applicable law and interest and
penalties thereon, (c) ad valorem, property, severance and other similar taxes
or assessments based upon or measured by the ownership of the Assets or the
production therefrom but only attributable to any period on or after the
Effective Time, (d) the environmental or physical condition of the Assets,
regardless of whether such environmental or physical condition arose before or
after the Effective Time, (e) obligations to properly plug and abandon or re-
plug or re-abandon or remove wells, flowlines, gathering lines or other
facilities, equipment or other personal property or fixtures comprising part
of such Assets, (f) obligations to restore the surface of such Assets and
obligations to remediate or bring the Assets into compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws (including conducting any remediation activities that may
be required on or otherwise in connection with activities on the Assets)
regardless of whether such obligations or conditions or events giving rise to
such obligations arose, occurred or accrued before or after the Effective
Time, and (g) any other duty, obligation, event, condition or liability
assumed by Buyer under the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the "Assumed
Obligations"). When the retention period for a Retained Obligation ends, such
Retained Obligation becomes an Assumed Obligation.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

4. Taxes and Payables

 

  

  

4.1 Payment of Taxes. All real estate, use, ad valorem and personal property
taxes and charges upon any of the Assets shall be prorated as of the Effective
Time; provided that Buyer shall pay all such taxes attributable to the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent due and payable
after Closing, and at Closing, the Purchase Price will be decreased by
Seller's pro rata share of such items for the period prior to the Effective
Time. If the actual amount of such items is not known as of the Closing Date
and the final reconciliation of the Final Settlement Statement under Section
10.4, then Seller's pro rata share of such items will be determined by using
the rates and millages for the most recent year available and the assessed
values for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which
the Closing Date occurs, with appropriate adjustments for any known changes
thereto. In no event shall the Final Settlement Statement be delayed pending
determination of the proration of taxes pursuant to this Section 4.1.

  

  

4.2 Production Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for all oil and gas
production taxes, and any other similar taxes applicable to Hydrocarbons
produced and saved from or attributable to its interest in the Leases, Wells
and Units prior to the Effective Time (excluding Stock Hydrocarbons), and
Buyer shall be responsible for all such taxes applicable to the Stock
Hydrocarbons and all Hydrocarbons produced and saved from or attributable to
the Leases, Wells and Units from and after the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, the taxes included in the preceding provisions of this
Section 4.2 do not apply to any and all federal, state, local and foreign
income and gains taxes attributable to the Assets or to the sale transactions
resulting from the operation of this Agreement, including Texas margin tax,
and, for purposes of such taxes, (i) any and all such income and gains taxes
resulting from the ownership of the Assets prior to and including the Closing
Date, including any income and gains taxes arising from the sale of the Assets
pursuant to this Agreement, shall be the obligation and liability of the
Seller, and Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from such taxes,
and (ii) any and all such income and gains taxes resulting from the ownership
of the Assets after the Closing Date shall be the obligation and liability of
the Buyer, and Buyer shall indemnify and holder Seller harmless from such
taxes.

  

  

4.3 Occasional Sale of Assets. Both parties believe that the sale of the
Assets is an occasional sale exempt from sales or use taxes. If any such taxes
are assessed against the transaction, both parties will cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to Seller) to attempt to
eliminate or reduce such taxes. If unsuccessful, Buyer shall be responsible
for any such taxes. In that event, Buyer shall pay Seller any such state and
local sales or use taxes, and Seller shall remit such amount to the
appropriate taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. Any reasonable
legal expenses incurred by Seller at Buyer's request to reduce or avoid any of
the aforementioned taxes attributable to Buyer, shall be paid or reimbursed by
Buyer.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

4.4 Tax Deferred Exchange. Seller and Buyer agree that this transaction may be
completed as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code") and that each party
will cooperate in completing the sale as a like-kind exchange. Either of both
Seller or Buyer may, at or before the Closing, elect to affect a tax deferred
exchange of the Assets for other qualifying properties (hereinafter
collectively called the "Exchange Property" in accordance with the following:

  

  

 

(a) In the event Seller makes such an election, Seller shall notify and
instruct Buyer, on or before the Closing Date, to have the Purchase Price paid
to a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) until Seller has designated the Exchange
Property. The Exchange Property shall be designated by Seller and acquired by
the qualified intermediary with the time periods prescribed by Section
1031(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event Seller fails to
designate and the qualified intermediary fails to acquire the Exchange
Property with such time periods, the agency or trust shall terminate and the
proceeds then held by the qualified intermediary shall be paid in accordance
with the terms of the agreements entered into between Seller and such
qualified intermediary.

 

  

  

 

(b) In the event Buyer makes such an election, Buyer shall notify and instruct
Seller, on or before the Closing Date, to have the Assets conveyed to a
qualified intermediary or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term
is defined in Rev. Proc. 2000-37 issued effective September 15, 2000).

 

  

  

 

(c) The rights and responsibilities of Seller, Buyer and the qualified
intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder shall be documented with
such agreements containing such terms and provisions as shall be reasonably
determined by Seller and Buyer to be necessary to accomplish a tax deferred
exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, subject, however, to
the limitations on costs and liabilities of Buyer and Seller set forth below.
If Seller makes a tax deferred exchange election, Buyer shall not be obligated
to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in the
acquisition of the Assets. If Buyer makes a tax deferred exchange election,
Seller shall not be obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any
additional obligations in the consummation of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement. Any such tax deferred exchange election by either party, shall
be effected through an assignment of this Agreement, or rights under this
Agreement, to a qualified intermediary or an exchange accommodation
titleholder, but such assignment shall not affect the duties, rights or
obligations of the parties under this Agreement, except as expressly set forth
in this Section 4.4.

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(d) Should either Seller or Buyer make such an election and should the tax
deferred exchange fail or be disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service for
any reason, the non-electing party's sole responsibility and liability to the
electing party shall be to take such actions as are required by Subsections
(a), (b) or (c) above and such non-electing party shall have no other
responsibility or liability whatsoever to the electing party; and the electing
party shall release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the non-electing
party from any responsibility or liability related to such election except for
such actions as may be required by Subsections (a), (b) or (c) above.

 

  

  

 

(e) Notwithstanding Subsections (a) through (d) above, the Closing shall not
be delayed or affected by reason of any tax deferred exchange election nor
shall consummation or accomplishment of a tax deferred exchange be a condition
precedent or condition subsequent to the exchanging party's duties, rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the exchanging party's failure or
inability to consummate a tax deferred exchange for any reason shall not
excuse or release the exchanging party from its duties, rights and obligations
under this Agreement.

transaction documents required hereunder to be executed and delivered by
Seller shall be duly executed and delivered and shall constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of Seller enforceable in accordance with their terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by Equitable Limitations.

other than this Agreement and (iv) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, clause (b) above shall be true and correct
except as to any governmental approvals of the type customarily obtained after
Closing and further provided that the failure to secure any consent or
approval to the conveyance of the Assets shall not be considered a breach of
this warranty (to the extent that the same has been identified by Seller in
Schedule 5.1(n)) but shall be treated as a Title Defect, (v) violate any
provision of or require any consent, authorization or approval under any law,
judgment, decree, judicial or administrative order.

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(e) No Brokers. Seller is not a party to any contract or agreement for the
payment of any broker's or finder's fee in connection with the origin,
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement for which Buyer will
have any liability whatsoever.

arrangement proceedings pending, being contemplated by or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened against Seller or Comstock Resources, Inc. None of Seller

action by any person, entity or Governmental Authority (as defined in Section

Seller's Knowledge, threatened against Seller or the Assets that could
reasonably be expected to affect Seller's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, the performance by Seller of its obligations
under this Agreement or other transaction documents, or title to, use or
operation of, development of or the value of any of the Assets.

 

  

  

 

(h) Taxes. All ad valorem, property, production, severance, excise and similar

the Effective Time to make deliveries of gas without receiving full payment
therefor.

6.4 Notice of Title Defects; Title Defect Valuation.

  

  

 

(a) If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting an Asset, Buyer shall
promptly notify Seller of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such
notice (a "Title Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (iii) describe the Title
Defect in reasonable detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue
Interest or Working Interest), (iv) identify the specific Asset or Assets
affected by such Title Defect and (v) include the Title Defect Value, as
reasonably determined by Buyer acting in good faith. Upon receipt of a timely
Title Defect Notice, upon request by Seller, Buyer shall promptly deliver to
Seller copies of all data, records, title reports, opinions and other
information in Buyer's possession or control bearing upon or relating to the
alleged Title Defect and its determination of the Title Defect Value.

 

  

  

 

(b) The value attributable to each Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value")
shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth below:

 

  

  

 

(i) If the Title Defect is a privilege or lien upon an Asset, the Title Defect
Value is the amount necessary to be paid to remove fully the privilege or lien
from the affected Asset.

 

  

  

 

(ii) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to a Well, Lease, Unit or PUD is less than that stated in Exhibit
"A" (and there is a corresponding and proportionate decrease in Working
Interest), then the Title Defect Value is the product of the Allocated Value
attributed to such Asset, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the difference between the Net Revenue Interest applicable thereto set forth
in Exhibit "A" and the actual Net Revenue Interest, and the denominator of
which is the applicable Net Revenue Interest stated in Exhibit "A".

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(iii) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for
which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) and for
which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title
Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of
the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the
legal effect of the Title Defect, and the potential discounted economic effect
of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset.

 

  

  

 

(iv) If a Title Defect does not adversely affect an Asset throughout the
entire productive life of such Asset or all depths as to all depths from below
the base of the Delaware Group Sands formation to the top of the Wolfcamp
"Red" Sand formation or their stratigraphic equivalents as reflected on by the
stratigraphic markers on Schedule 6.2 or their stratigraphic equivalents such
fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value;
provided, however, that no Title Defect shall be asserted by Seller with
respect to the Chevy 17 Well and Big Joe 29 #1 Well solely because Seller does
not own marketable title below the base of the 3rd Bone Springs Formation.

 

  

  

 

(v) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder.

 

  

  

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells, Leases and other
Assets affected thereby.

 

  

  

 

(vii) Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 

  

  

 

(viii) If the Title Defect is an un-obtained consent, then the Title Defect
Value shall be the Allocated Value of the affected Assets and the threshold
and deductible for Title Defects described in Section 6.7 shall not be
applicable.

 

  

  

 

(ix) If the Title Defect concerns a deficiency of net mineral acres, then the
Title Defect Value shall be calculated by the number of net mineral acres by
which Seller is deficient, multiplied by the per net mineral acre value
described in Schedule 6.4(b)(ix).

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(x) If the Title Defect concerns a remaining primary term shorter than three
(3) months after the Closing date for a Lease not currently held by
production, the Title Defect Value shall be the Allocated Value for such
Lease, and if no Allocated Value is provided for such Lease, then the Title
Defect Value shall be the applicable per net mineral acre value for such Lease
multiplied by the number of net mineral acres covered by such Lease, and the
threshold and deductible for Title Defects described in Section 6.7 shall not
be applicable.

 

  

  

6.5 Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Section 2.4(b)(vii), 6.7 and
10.1(b)(iv) (and except with regard a breach of the special warranty of title
under the Assignment), the following shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to Title Defects:

  

  

 

(a) Upon the receipt of a Title Defect Notice from Buyer asserting an alleged
Title Defect, Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt
to cure such Title Defect at Seller's sole cost at any time prior to the
Closing.

 

  

  

 

(b) With respect to any alleged Title Defect that is not reasonably cured on
or before the Closing and the Title Defect Value for such Asset equals or
exceeds the Allocated Value for such Asset, Seller shall have the option, but
not the obligation, to exclude the affected Asset from the Assets delivered at
Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
affected Asset.

 

  

  

 

(c) With respect to each alleged Title Defect that is not reasonably cured on
or before the Closing and the affected Asset has not been excluded from the
transaction pursuant to Section 6.5(b), the Purchase Price hereunder will be
reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value thereof, and giving
effect to the criteria set out in Section 6.4(b) above.

 

  

  

 

(d) (i) if Seller has not agreed on or before Closing upon the validity of an
asserted Title Defect, or has not agreed upon the Title Defect Value
attributable thereto, or (ii) if Buyer has not agreed upon whether a Title
Defect has been reasonably cured, then either party shall have the right to
elect by written notice, delivered before or after Closing, to have the
validity of such Title Defect, such Title Defect Value or the sufficiency of
Seller's cure determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 8. The
Assets to which such dispute relates shall, nonetheless, be assigned and
conveyed to Buyer at Closing, but until resolved by such Independent Expert,
the Title Defect Value asserted by Buyer with regard thereto shall be withheld
from the Closing payment and retained by Buyer until such dispute is finally
resolved as provided in Section 8 hereof, which shall include, without
limitation, an award of the amounts withheld from Closing attributable to such
Title Defect. To the extent the Independent Expert is determining the validity
of a Title Defect, Seller shall have ninety (90) days from the date the
Independent Expert determines that a Title Defect exists to cure such Title
Defect.

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(e) Any Title Defect cured by Seller or for which Buyer receives a Purchase
Price adjustment or payment pursuant to this Section 6.5, shall constitute a
Permitted Encumbrance hereunder and under the Assignment.

 

  

  

6.6 Title Benefits.

  

  

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.7, Seller shall be entitled to an upward adjustment
to the Purchase Price with respect to all Title Benefits of which Seller
provides Buyer notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") in writing prior to the
expiration of the Examination Period in an amount (the "Title Benefit Value")
mutually agreed upon by the parties determined in accordance with the criteria
set forth in Section 6.4(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Title
Defect Value is disputed, no upward adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be
made for Title Benefits until the Title Defect Value has been determined in
accordance with Section 6.5. A party identifying a Title Benefit affecting the
Assets shall promptly deliver such a Title Benefit Notice to the other party
in the same form and including the same information as specified in Section
6.4(a) for a Title Defect Notice. The term "Title Benefit" shall mean Seller's
Net Revenue Interest in any Well that is greater than the Net Revenue Interest
set forth in Exhibit "A", or Seller's Working Interest in any Well that is
less than the Working Interest set forth in Exhibit "A" (without a
proportionate decrease in the Net Revenue Interest). A Title Benefit Value
agreed to by Buyer and Seller shall offset the aggregate Title Defects Values
only, and shall not be a direct increase to the Purchase Price.

 

  

  

 

(b) If, with respect to an asserted Title Benefit, the parties have not agreed
on the validity of the Title Benefit or the Title Benefit Value attributable
thereto on or before Closing, then either party shall have the right to elect
by written notice to the other party to have the validity of the Title Benefit
and/or the Title Benefit Value determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to
Section 8. If the validity of the Title Benefit and/or the Title Benefit Value
is not determined pursuant to this Agreement by the Closing, the Title Benefit
Value determined by Seller, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall offset
the aggregate Title Defect Value.

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.7 Limitation of Remedies for Title Defects; Title Benefits. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if (a) the Title Defect
Value for a given Title Defect, or the Title Benefit Value of a given Title
Benefit, does not exceed $35,000, then no claim or adjustment to the Purchase
Price shall be made for such Title Defect or Title Benefit; (b) if the
aggregate net value of all uncured Title Defects does not exceed 3/4ths of one
percent (0.75%) of the Purchase Price under this Agreement (the "Aggregate
Title Threshold"), then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made
therefor and (c) if the aggregate net value of all uncured Title Defects and
Title Benefits exceeds the Aggregate Title Threshold (prior to any adjustments
thereto), then the Purchase Price shall only be adjusted by the amount of
excess net value of all uncured Title Defects and Title Benefits.

  

  

 

7. Environmental Matters

 

  

  

7.1 Environmental Review.

  

  

 

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct an environmental review of the
Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination Period ("Buyer's
Environmental Review"). Seller shall provide Buyer such access as it may
reasonably request to the Assets (if operated by Seller) and the environmental
data in Seller's files for the Assets. With respect to Assets not operated by
Seller, Seller agrees, at no cost or expense to Seller, to request that the
operator of such Assets grant Buyer (and shall use commercially reasonable and
diligent efforts to obtain for Buyer) such access. Except in connection with
any applicable representations and warranties under this Agreement, Seller
makes no representations or warranties whatsoever as to the accuracy,
completeness or reliability of any such environmental information, and Buyer
relies and depends on and uses any and all such environmental information,
review or inspection exclusively and entirely at its own risk and without any
recourse to Seller whatsoever.

 

  

  

 

(b) The cost and expense of Buyer's Environmental Review shall be borne solely
by Buyer. The scope of work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review conducted
at or upon the Leases, Units and Wells shall not include any intrusive test or
procedure without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer shall (i) consult
with Seller before conducting any work comprising such Buyer's Environmental
Review, (ii) perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as
to not unreasonably interfere with operations of the Assets, and (iii) comply
with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations of applicable Governmental
Authority. Seller shall be responsible for obtaining any third party consents
that are required in order to perform any work comprising Buyer's
Environmental Review. Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to requesting each
such third party consent and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
connection with obtaining such consent. Seller shall have the right to have a
representative or representatives accompany Buyer at all times during Buyer's
Environmental Review, and Buyer shall give Seller notice not more than seven
(7) days and not less than 24 hours before any visits by Buyer to the Assets,
and Buyer shall seek and obtain Seller's prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before it enters upon the Assets. With respect to any
samples taken in connection with Buyer's Environmental Review, Buyer shall
take split samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and
identified, to Seller. Buyer hereby agrees to release, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Seller Parties from and against all Claims arising from, out of
or in connection with, or otherwise relating to, Buyer's Environmental Review,
REGARDLESS OF THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT
ANY SELLER PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY,
REGULATORY LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY OR OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF A SELLER PARTY OR ANY OTHER
PERSON OR PARTY. Provided, however, the mere discovery of information by Buyer
in connection with Buyer's Environmental Review relating to the condition of
the Assets prior to Buyer's Environmental Review, shall not itself give rise
to an indemnity obligation owed by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Section
7.1(b).

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Buyer shall treat all matters
revealed by Buyer's Environmental Review, including, without limitation, any
analyses, compilations, studies, documents, reports or data prepared or
generated from such review (the "Environmental Information"), as confidential,
and Buyer shall not disclose any Environmental Information to any Governmental
Authority or other third party without the prior written consent of Seller
except as hereafter provided or to the extent required by applicable law.
Buyer may use the Environmental Information only in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Environmental Information
shall be disclosed by Buyer to only those persons who need to know the
Environmental Information for purposes of evaluating the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and who agree to be bound by the terms of this
Section 7.1(c). If Buyer or any third party to whom Buyer has provided any
Environmental Information is requested, compelled or required to disclose any
of the Environmental Information by a court or other Governmental Authority,
or disclosure is otherwise required under applicable law, Buyer shall provide
Seller with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to
allow Seller to file for any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Closing, upon Seller's request Buyer shall promptly deliver the
Environmental Information, and all copies thereof and works based thereon, to
Seller, which Environmental Information shall become the sole property of
Seller; provided, however, that Buyer may retain copies thereof in the event
of a dispute between Buyer and Seller arising from or relating to such
termination. Upon request, Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental
Information to Seller without charge. The terms and provisions of this Section
7.1(c) shall survive any such termination of this Agreement, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary. In no event shall an Environmental Defect be the
basis for adjusting the Purchase Price by an amount greater than the Allocated
Value of the Asset(s) affected thereby.

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(d) NORM. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOME OILFIELD PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT LOCATED ON THE PROPERTIES
MAY CONTAIN ASBESTOS AND/OR NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL ("NORM").
IN THIS REGARD, BUYER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTANDS THAT NORM MAY AFFIX OR ATTACH
ITSELF TO THE INSIDE OF WELLS, MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT AS SCALE OR IN OTHER
FORMS, AND THAT WELLS, MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT LOCATED ON THE PROPERTIES
DESCRIBED HEREIN MAY CONTAIN NORM AND THAT NORM-CONTAINING MATERIALS MAY BE
BURIED OR MAY HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ON THE PROPERTIES COMPRISING OR
SITUATED ON THE ASSETS. BUYER ALSO EXPRESSLY UNDERSTANDS THAT SPECIAL
PROCEDURES MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF ASBESTOS AND NORM
FROM THE PROPERTIES WHERE THEY MAY BE FOUND. BUYER SHALL, BY CLOSING ITS
PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTIES, ASSUME ALL LIABILITY WHEN SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE
PERFORMED AFTER CLOSING.

 

  

  

7.2 Environmental Definitions.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(a) The term "Environmental Defect" shall mean, with respect to any given
Asset, a material violation of Environmental Laws in effect as of the
Effective Time in the jurisdiction in which such Asset is located.

 

  

  

 

(b) The term "Governmental Authority" shall mean any tribal authority, the
United States and any state, county or parish, city and political subdivisions
that exercises jurisdiction, and any agency, judicial authority, department,
board, commission or other instrumentality thereof.

 

  

  

 

(c) The term "Environmental Laws" shall mean all laws, statutes, ordinances,
court decisions, rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority
pertaining to the protection or preservation of the environment, human health,
wildlife or environmentally sensitive areas, the remediation of contamination
or the handling, transportation, disposal or release into the environment of
hazardous or toxic materials, including, without limitation, those arising
under or by virtue of any Lease, Contract, agreement, document, permit,
applicable statute or rule or regulation or order of any governmental
authority, specifically including, without limitation, any governmental
request or requirement to take any clean-up or other action with respect to
any of the Assets or premises, including hazardous waste cleanup costs under
the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901, et seq., the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901, et seq., the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA),
42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq., the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, the Toxic Substances Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and any
and all provisions of the Texas Water Code and the Texas Natural Resources
Code, or similar laws, rules or regulations.

 

  

  

 

(d) The term "Environmental Defect Value" shall mean, with respect to an
Environmental Defect, the estimated costs and expenses to correct or remediate
such Environmental Defect, and to satisfy any and all liabilities, damages,
fines or penalties associated therewith.

 

  

  

7.3 Notice of Environmental Defects. If Buyer discovers any alleged
Environmental Defect affecting the Assets, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be effective, such notice (an
"Environmental Defect Notice") must (a) be in writing, (b) be received prior
to the expiration of the Examination Period, (c) describe the Environmental
Defect in reasonable detail, including (i) the written conclusion of Buyer
that an Environmental Defect exists and (ii) if then known by Buyer, a
citation of the Environmental Laws alleged to be violated and a summary of the
related facts that substantiate such violation (but failure to cite all
applicable laws shall not reduce or relieve the Seller in connection with
liability thereunder nor the calculation of the Environmental Defect Value
thereof), (d) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by such
Environmental Defect, (e) indicate the procedures recommended to correct the
Environmental Defect and (f) indicate Buyer's reasonable good faith estimate
of the Environmental Defect Value, for which Buyer would agree to adjust the
Purchase Price in order to accept such Environmental Defect if Seller elected
Section 7.4(c) as the remedy therefor. Any matters that may otherwise
constitute Environmental Defects, but of which Seller has not been
specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, together with
any environmental matter that does not constitute an Environmental Defect,
shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute
an Assumed Obligation of Buyer at Closing, except for a breach of the
representations and warranties in Section 5.1(j) above. Upon receipt of a
timely Environmental Defect Notice, upon request by Seller, Buyer shall
promptly deliver to Seller copies of all data, records, reports, opinions and
other information in Buyer's possession or control bearing upon or relating to
the alleged Environmental Defect and its determination of the Environmental
Defect Value, including, without limitation, site plans showing the location
of sampling events, boring logs and other field notes describing the sampling
methods utilized and the field conditions observed, chain of custody
documentation and laboratory reports.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.4 Remedies for Environmental Defects. Subject to Sections 7.5 and 7.6, the
following shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to alleged
Environmental Defects:

  

  

 

(a) Upon the receipt of an Environmental Defect Notice from Buyer asserting an
alleged Environmental Defect, Seller shall have the option, but not the
obligation, to attempt to cure such Environmental Defect at any time prior to
the Closing.

 

  

  

 

(b) With respect to any alleged Environmental Defect that is not reasonably
cured on or before the Closing, and the Environmental Defect Value for such
Asset exceeds the Allocated Value for such Asset, either Party may have the
option, but not the obligation, to exclude the affected Asset from the Assets
delivered at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such affected Asset.

 

  

  

 

(c) With respect to each alleged Environmental Defect that is not reasonably
cured on or before the Closing and has not been excluded from the transaction
pursuant to Section 7.4(b), the Purchase Price hereunder will be reduced by an
amount equal to the Environmental Defect Value thereof.

 

  

  

 

(d) (i) If Seller has not objected in writing to Buyer on or before Closing
upon the validity of any asserted Environmental Defect, or on the
Environmental Defect Value therefor or (ii) if Buyer has not agreed upon
whether an alleged Environmental Defect has been reasonably cured, then either
party by written notice to the other party, delivered before or after Closing,
shall have the right to elect to have the validity of the asserted
Environmental Defect, the Environmental Defect Value for such Environmental
Defect, or the sufficiency of Seller's cure determined by an Independent
Expert pursuant to Section 8. If the asserted Environmental Defect Value
exceeds the Allocated Value of the Asset, then the affected Asset shall be
withheld from Closing and not conveyed to Buyer (and the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the Allocated Value, subject to the resolution of such dispute
by the Independent Expert under Section 8 (and if the Environmental Defect
Value is less than the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, then such Asset
shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, but Buyer shall withhold the
Environmental Defect Value asserted by Buyer from the Closing payment, subject
to the resolution of such dispute by the Independent Expert under Section 8).

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.5 Limitation of Remedies for Environmental Defects. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) if the Environmental Defect
Value for a given Environmental Defect does not exceed $35,000, then no
adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Environmental Defect,
(b) if the aggregate of all Environmental Defect Values exceeding $35,000 for
uncured Environmental Defects not waived by Buyer and aggregate net does not
exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price under this
Agreement (the "Aggregate Environmental Defect Threshold"), then no adjustment
of the Purchase Price shall be made therefor and (c) if the aggregate of all
Environmental Defect Values exceeding $35,000 for uncured Environmental
Defects not waived by Buyer in writing exceeds the Aggregate Environmental
Defect Threshold, then the Purchase Price shall only be reduced by the amount
of such excess Environmental Defect Values.

  

  

7.6 Post-Closing Environmental Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to Section
3.3(b) and the representations and warranties in Section 5.1(j)(iii) above,
and other than Retained Obligations, upon Closing, Buyer shall, with respect
to the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing and without regard to whether same
arise or occur prior to or after the Effective Time (except as otherwise
expressly provided below) assume and indemnify, defend and hold Seller Parties
harmless from and against any and all Claims caused by, resulting from, or
relating or incidental to all matters affecting health, safety and the
environment (excluding, however, fines and penalties owed by Seller with
respect to ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time)
including without limitation Claims relating to:

  

  

 

(a) environmental pollution or contamination on the Assets conveyed to Buyer
at Closing, including pollution or contamination of the soil, groundwater or
air by Hydrocarbons, drilling fluid and other chemicals, brine, produced
water, NORM or any other substance, and other violation of Environmental Laws;

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(b) underground injection activities and waste disposal on the Assets conveyed
to Buyer at Closing;

 

  

  

 

(c) clean-up responses, and the cost of remediation, control, assessment or
compliance with respect to surface and subsurface pollution caused by spills,
pits, ponds, lagoons or storage tanks solely insofar as attributed to the
Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing;

 

  

  

 

(d) disposal of any hazardous substances and wastes regulated under
Environmental Laws, materials and products generated by or used in connection
with the ownership, development, operation or abandonment of any part of the
Assets; and

 

  

  

 

(e) non-compliance of the Assets conveyed to Buyer at Closing under
Environmental Laws,

 

  

  

REGARDLESS OF THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT
SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH
OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, REGULATORY LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR PARTY.

  

  

7.7 Condition of the Assets. Subject to Section 3.3(b) and the representations
and warranties in Section 5.1(j) and 5.1(v) above, and other than Retained
Obligations, upon the Closing, Buyer specifically assumes the environmental
risk and environmental condition of the Assets and the physical condition of
any equipment or personal property included as part of the Assets and shall
inspect the Assets prior to Closing, or if such right of inspection is not
exercised, shall be deemed to have waived such right. Buyer stipulates that
any such inspection, if made, shall cover but not be limited to the physical
and environmental condition, both surface and subsurface, of the Assets. It is
expressly recognized by Buyer that the lands, along with the facilities and
equipment located thereon, having been used in connection with oil, gas and
water production, treatment, storage and disposal activities, and may contain
NORM, asbestos and other hazardous substances as a result of these operations.
Following the Closing, and subject to Section 3.3(b) and the representations
and warranties in Section 5.1(j)(iii) above, and other than Retained
Obligations, the generation, formation, or presence of NORM, asbestos or other
hazardous substances in or on the Assets shall be the sole responsibility of
Buyer, and upon Closing, with regard to the Assets actually conveyed to Buyer,
Buyer and all future assignees and successors of Buyer shall defend, indemnify
and hold Seller Parties harmless from and against any and all Claims in any
way arising from, out of or in connection with, or otherwise relating to, the
presence of NORM, asbestos or other hazardous substances, without regard to
whether such NORM, asbestos or other hazardous substance was in place before
or after the Effective Time, and REGARDLESS OF THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR
COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE (BUT NOT SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT), BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY,
REGULATORY LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF
SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR PARTY.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.8 Waiver. Buyer, with and upon Closing, and subject to Section 3.3(b) and
the representations and warranties in Section 5.1(j)(iii) above, and other
than Retained Obligations waives for all purposes all objections associated
with the environmental condition of the Assets, unless raised by proper notice
within the Examination Period, and Buyer (and on behalf of Buyer Parties and
their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all such unasserted
Claims they may have against the Seller Parties associated therewith, except
with regard to the representations and warranties under Section 5.1(j)(iii)
above.

  

  

 

8. Independent Experts

 

  

  

8.1 Selection of Independent Experts. Any disputes regarding Title Defects,
Title Benefits, Title Defect Values, Title Benefit Values, Environmental
Defects, Environmental Defect Values, the cure of Title Defects or
Environmental Defects, any other matter for which Buyer or Seller is
indemnified hereunder, and the calculation of the Final Settlement Statement,
or revisions thereto, may, as herein provided, be submitted by a party, with
written notice to the other party, to an independent expert (the "Independent
Expert"), who shall serve as the sole and exclusive arbitrator of any such
dispute. The Independent Expert, with regard to any disputes regarding Title
Defect Values, Title Benefit Values, Environmental Defects, Environmental
Defect Values, the cure of Title Defects or Environmental Defects, shall be
selected upon his field of expertise with the mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller and shall have both knowledge and experience involving properties in
the regional area in which the properties are located. If the parties are
unable to agree on an Independent Expert, Seller shall appoint an arbitrator
of its choice and Buyer shall appoint an arbitrator of its choice (each, a
"Party Appointed Arbitrator"). the two Party Appointed Arbitrators shall in
turn appoint a third to be the Independent Expert.

  

  

8.2 Location of Proceeding. All proceedings under this Section 8 shall be
conducted in Houston, Texas.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

9. Additional Covenants

 

  

  

9.1 Operations Prior to Closing. After the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing, as to any of the Assets operated by Seller, Seller shall use,
operate and maintain the Assets in substantially the same manner in which they
have been used, operated and maintained prior to this Agreement, in accordance
with all applicable laws and regulations, in accordance with common industry
standards and as a reasonable and prudent operator. During the period from the
Effective Time until Closing, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer for
Claims sustained or liabilities incurred with respect to the Assets,
REGARDLESS OF THE SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, REGULATORY LIABILITY, STATUTORY LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT
(EXCLUDING BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY SELLER), BREACH OF WARRANTY OR OTHER
FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR PARTY, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SELLER. After
the date hereof and prior to Closing, Seller may (without Buyer's consent)
enter into agreements or transactions in relation to the Assets which (a)
individually involve a reasonably anticipated cost of less than $50,000,
individually, and do not impose any area of mutual interest, non-compete,
drilling or surface restrictions, and (b) are entered into in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practices. With Closing, Seller is
relieved of and shall not be obligated for any expenditures attributable to
periods after the Effective Time, and shall recover any such charges and
expenses as part of the Closing Statement and Final Settlement Statement
adjustments, as appropriate. Except with respect to those matters described
above, if any material expenditure, contract or agreement is proposed or
contemplated, Seller shall promptly submit such proposal to Buyer for
concurrence with Seller's recommendation. Buyer will make any required
election under its independent evaluation and, if the Closing occurs and such
Assets are conveyed to Buyer, shall assume the cost and risk of any
consequences which arise as a result of Buyer's election to participate or
Buyer's failure to timely elect or election to not participate in or not
approve an operation and not pay such expenditure, without regard to whether
Closing occurs. Failure of Buyer to timely respond to an election request
(which election request shall be provided to Buyer no later than ten (10)
business days prior to the date such election must be made), shall be deemed
an election by Buyer to accept and agree to the proposed election proposed
(and participate in the proposed operation). Additionally, after the execution
of this Agreement and prior to Closing, Seller shall have the right to make
any changes, repairs or modifications to the Assets, and incur any related
expenditure deemed necessary by Seller, insofar as the same is necessary to
prevent or respond to an emergency involving serious risk of loss of or damage
to life, property, or the environment, or maintain economic production from
any Lease, Well or Unit. With regard to the preceding sentence, Seller shall
notify Buyer as soon as possible of the emergency and Seller's response
thereto and shall have the right to cause or effect such expenditure or action
with or without Buyer's approval, and recover such costs in the Closing
Statement or Final Settlement Statement adjustments, as appropriate. Prior to
Closing, Seller shall (i) consult with and advise Buyer regarding all material
matters concerning the operation, management, and administration of the Assets
and (ii) obtain Buyer's written approval before voting or making any election
under any operating, unit, joint venture, or similar agreement. Furthermore,
Seller will not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, (x) enter into
any agreement or arrangement transferring, selling, abandon, forfeit, or
encumbering any of the Assets, (y) grant any preferential or other similar
right to purchase any of the Assets, enter into any areas of mutual interest,
non-compete agreements, drilling or surface restrictions, (z) enter into any
new production sales, gathering, transportation, treating, or processing
contract extending beyond the Closing Date and not terminable on thirty (30)
days' notice or less, without penalty or liability, (aa) amend or terminate
any Contract, (bb) take any other action or election with regard to the Assets
equal to or in excess $50,000, net to the interest in the Assets to be
conveyed Buyer. Promptly after execution of this Agreement, Seller shall
notify the holders of the Consents of the transactions contemplated herein and
request their consent. Buyer shall have the right to review and approve the
form of such notices, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer and
Seller each agree to reasonably cooperate with efforts to obtain such required
Consents.

9.2 Preferential Rights to Purchase and Consents.

  

  

 

(a) Notice. Promptly after execution of this Agreement (and in no event later
than five (5) days after execution), Seller shall (i) use the Allocated Values
set forth on Schedule 2.3 to provide each required Preferential Right
notification, in accordance with the terms thereof, and (ii) send to any party
whose consent or approval is required in connection with the transfer and
conveyance of the Assets to Buyer as contemplated herein a written request for
such consent or approval, in accordance with the requirements of the Lease,
Contract, agreement, instrument, or provision giving rise to the need for such
consent or approval.

 

  

  

 

(b) Third Party Exercise. If a third party gives valid and timely notice of
its exercise of a Preferential Right to purchase any of the Assets, the
affected Assets will not be sold to Buyer and the Purchase Price will be
adjusted by the Allocated Value of the affected Assets. If Buyer has allocated
a positive Allocated Value to the Preferential Right Asset, the Purchase Price
will be reduced by the dollar amount of the positive allocation. If Buyer has
allocated a negative Allocated Value to the Preferential Right Asset, the
Purchase Price will be increased by the absolute value of the negative
allocation. Buyer remains obligated to purchase the remainder of the Assets
not affected by exercised Preferential Rights without reduction to the
Purchase Price attributable to such unaffected Assets in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 

  

  

 

(c) Third Party Failure to Purchase. If a third party gives notice of its
intent to exercise a Preferential Right to purchase any of the Assets, but
does not close the purchase for any reason either before or within a
reasonable time after Closing, or if a third party fails to give valid and
timely notice of its exercise of a Preferential Right to purchase any of the
Assets within the express time provided for such notice, then there shall
promptly be an additional Closing between Seller and Buyer for such portion of
the Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, by which Seller will
transfer the affected portion of the Assets to Buyer and Buyer will pay Seller
that portion of the Purchase Price attributable thereto (or in the case of a
negative allocation, Seller will refund the absolute value of the negative
amount to Buyer) (in each case subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.4).

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.3 Compliance. From and after Closing, Buyer shall comply with contracts,
agreements, Leases and applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and
shall promptly obtain and maintain all permits required by Governmental
Authorities in connection with the Assets purchased.

  

  

9.4 Employees. Except for those persons listed on Schedule 9.4, Buyer shall
not contact or communicate with Seller's employees until Closing; provided,
however, Buyer shall be permitted and allowed to discuss employment or offer
to employ or employ any non-employee contract field personnel and contract
land services providers promptly after execution of this Agreement; and
provided, further, that this provision shall not apply to any employee of
Seller who responds to a public posting or advertisement for employment with
Buyer.

  

  

9.5 Non-Compete. Seller, and all its parent company, sister companies,
affiliates, and any direct or indirect majority owned and controlled
subsidiaries or affiliates, and subsidiaries agree to forego, directly or
indirectly, (i) top leasing any of the acreage currently covered by any of the
Leases during the Restricted Period (as defined below), (ii) purchasing,
farming-in or otherwise acquiring, directly or indirectly, during the
Restricted Period (as defined below) of any oil and gas leases, oil, gas and
mineral leases, working interests, production payments, net profits interests,
fee mineral interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, non-
working and carried interests, reversionary interests, possibilities of
reverter, conversion rights and options, operating rights and other interests
in land, including, without limitation, any rights and interests in any unit
or pooled area, and purchasing of any oil, gas and condensate wells within a
radius of one (1) mile from each of the Wells existing as of the Closing Date
or within a radius of one (1) mile from the boundaries of each of the Leases
(the area described in subparts (i) and (ii) above are collectively referred
to as the "Restricted Area"); and (iii) all activities related to exploration,
drilling, development, production, marketing and/or selling of hydrocarbons
produced from the Restricted Area for a period of one (1) year after the
Closing Date (such period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring one (1)
year thereafter is referred to as the "Restricted Period") without the express
written consent of Buyer. Acceptance by Buyer to particular exceptions to this
clause will not constitute waiver of this clause. Seller acknowledges that the
restrctions and covenants set forth herein constitute valuable consideration
for Buyer's agreement to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, and Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement but for Seller's agreement to the provisions of this Section 9.5. It
is also agreed that in addition to any other rights or remedies that Buyer
have have at law or in equity, Buyer shall have the continuing right to
specific enforcement and injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of this
Section 9.5. Seller shall cause its affiliates and subsidiaries to comply
with, assume and be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.5, and Seller
shall be jointly and severally liable for any breach of these provisions by
any of its affiliates or subsidiaries. Provided, however, this Section 9.5
shall not apply to Assets retained by Seller because they have been excluded
from the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to and in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.6 Financial Information and Audit Cooperation. After execution of this
Agreement, and continuing thereafter including for a period of twelve (12)
months following Closing Date, Seller agrees to make available to Buyer,

interfere with the normal operation of the business of Seller or any Affiliate

but not limited to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and related or applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Seller agrees to the following:

  

  

 

(a) Seller will, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, use its commercially

affected Asset. In such event the failure to satisfy this condition shall not
be grounds for termination.

 

  

  

 

(v) All Preferential Rights shall have been waived, exercised, or the time
period in which to exercise expired without exercise. Provided, however, if
this condition is not satisfied, either Party shall have the option to treat
the affected Asset as having a Title Defect and may exclude the affected Asset

covering the Assets required under any laws, rules or regulations of any
federal, state or local Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Assets, to replace Seller's existing bonds covering the Assets shown on

affected Asset and shall not be subject to the Title Defect Threshold. In such
event the failure to satisfy this condition shall not be grounds for
termination, except to the extent that the condition under Section 10.1(b)(vi)
below is not satisfied. For an Asset subject to a consent to assignment that
Seller did not obtain prior to Closing and which was excluded from Closing at

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(v) All Preferential Rights shall have been waived, exercised, or the time
period in which to exercise expired without exercise. Provided, however, if
this condition is not satisfied, either Party shall have the option to treat
the affected Asset as having a Title Defect and may exclude the affected Asset
from the Assets delivered at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such affected Asset. In such event the failure to
satisfy this condition shall not be grounds for termination, except to the
extent that the condition under Section 10.1(b)(vi) below is not satisfied.

exercised by third parties, un-obtained consents, and Casualty Losses shall
not have exceeded twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the Purchase Price.

and such condition has not been waived by Buyer by such date; provided that
Buyer is not in material breach of this Agreement;

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(c) By mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller; or

 

  

  

 

(d) By either Buyer or Seller if Closing has not occurred on or before July

(e) By either Buyer or Seller if any governmental authority shall have issued

(f) If all of Buyer's conditions to close under Section 10.1(b) have been
fully satisfied, and Buyer, through no fault of Seller refuses, for any reason
not permitted by this Agreement to close the sale pursuant hereto, subject to
Section 11.19 Seller shall have the right to seek all remedies available at
law or equity, including specific performance, and any of Deposit delivered to

any manner whatsoever. If Seller, through no fault of Buyer, fails, refuses,
or is unable for any reason not permitted by this Agreement to close the sale

10.4 Final Adjustments. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of
Closing, Seller shall prepare, in consultation with Buyer, a Final Settlement
Statement, acting reasonably and in good faith (the "Final Settlement
Statement"), setting forth (i) the final adjustments to the Purchase Price
provided in Section 2.4 and (ii) any other adjustments arising pursuant to
this Agreement or to which the parties mutually agree. Seller may set off any
resulting amount due to Buyer against any amount or sum that Buyer may
otherwise owe to Seller under the terms of this Agreement. Seller shall submit
the Final Settlement Statement to Buyer, along with copies of third party
vendor invoices, or other evidence of expenses agreed to by Buyer and Seller.
Buyer shall respond in writing with objections and proposed corrections within
thirty (30) days of receiving the Final Settlement Statement. If Buyer does
not respond to the Final Settlement Statement by signing or objecting in
writing within such thirty (30) day period, the statement will be deemed
approved by Buyer and final and binding between the parties. After approval of
the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer or Seller will send a check or invoice
to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, for the net amount reflected therein
as owed by such party. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree to all
adjustments within thirty (30) days after Buyer's written objection to the
Final Settlement Statement submitted by Seller, adjustments which are not in
dispute shall be paid by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, at the
expiration of such thirty day period and either party may submit such
disagreement to an Independent Expert selected in the manner provided in
Section 8 for resolution. An Independent Expert selected with respect to any
dispute relating to the Final Settlement Statement need not be the Independent
Expert selected pursuant to Section 8 with respect to a Title Defect or
Environmental Defect, if any such person had been previously selected with
respect to such matters.

11. Miscellaneous

 

  

  

11.1 Oil, Gas and End Product Imbalances. Regardless of whether Seller is
overproduced or underproduced as to its share of total oil, condensate, gas or
end product production, any balancing obligation or credit arising from such
over or underproduction, and any pipeline imbalance, in each case determined
as of the Effective Time (an "Imbalance") shall transfer to Buyer as of the
Effective Time, and Seller shall have no further liability therefor nor
benefit therefrom (whichever the case may be) as of the Effective Time. If
Seller is a party to a gas balancing agreement(s) or other reconciliation
obligations pursuant to any commingling authority covering all or a portion of
the Assets, Buyer shall assume all rights and duties of Seller pursuant
thereto. If any of the Assets are not covered by a gas balancing agreement or
other reconciliation obligations pursuant to any commingling authority, Buyer
shall fulfill its obligations under this provision in accordance with
applicable law. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller and Seller
Parties harmless against any and all Claims arising directly or indirectly out
of Buyer's failure to fulfill its obligation under this provision, insofar and
only insofar as the Buyer's aggregate liability under this indemnity does not
exceed (and Buyer's liability is expressly limited and capped at) an aggregate
amount equal to the downward adjustments to the Purchase Price credit to Buyer
at Closing attributable to the Imbalance. Buyer and Seller will settle all
Imbalances as between themselves using a settlement price based on $85.00 a
barrel for oil, $85.00 per barrel for condensate, $3.25 per mcf for gas, and
$32.00 per barrel for end product (NGL's).

  

  

11.2 Insurance. With regard to any Seller-operated properties:

  

  

 

(a) Seller and Buyer acknowledge that insurance coverage for the Assets and
the operations in which the Assets have been used has been provided, in part,
under insurance programs arranged and maintained by Seller for itself and, if
applicable, its subsidiaries and affiliates (such policies are herein called
"Seller Policies").

 

  

  

 

(b) Seller agrees that during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Seller shall maintain insurance with respect to the
Assets with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, in such
amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily
carried by reasonable, prudent operators of similar properties.

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(c) Seller and Buyer agree that, as of the Closing Date, all of the Seller
Policies shall cease to apply to the Assets and the operations in which the
Assets are used and that Buyer shall make no claims under the Seller Policies
with respect to any matter whatsoever, whether arising before or after the
Closing Date.

 

  

  

 

(d) In the event that any Claim is hereafter made under or with respect to any
of the Seller Policies by Buyer or any of its affiliates, but not an unrelated
third party, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Seller and Seller Parties
against and shall hold them harmless from such Claim and all costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and court costs)
related thereto.

 

  

  

11.3 Casualty Loss of Assets. If, after execution of this Agreement and prior
to Closing, a portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty
Loss, Seller may at its sole option, prior to Closing, repair the damage at
its cost or reduce the Purchase Price by the amount of the damage, or if Buyer
agrees, withdraw the damaged Asset from the sale and reduce the Purchase Price
by the Allocated Value thereof. Should Buyer and Seller not agree as to the
amount of such price reduction such dispute shall be submitted to the
Independent Expert for determination. The term "Casualty Loss" shall mean
physical damage to, loss of, condemnation or other taking by a governmental
authority of any part of, an Asset that (a) occurs between execution of this
Agreement and Closing, (b) is not the result of normal wear and tear,
mechanical failure or gradual structural deterioration of materials, equipment
and infrastructure, reservoir changes, or downhole failure (including, without
limitation, downhole failure arising or occurring during drilling or
completing operations, junked or lost holes or sidetracking or deviating a
well) and (c) exceeds Thirty Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000) in value.

  

  

11.4 Books and Records. Seller shall deliver the Records to Buyer at Closing
or within a reasonable time thereafter, if such Records useful or necessary
for Seller to Seller to provide Services under the Transition Services
Agreement, then fifteen (15) days after termination of the Transition Services
Agreement.

  

  

11.5 Publicity. Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to
all press releases or other public or private announcements made concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and except as may be
required by applicable laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any
Governmental Authority or stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue
any such press release or other publicity without the prior written consent of
the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Except as may be
required by applicable laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any
Governmental Authority or stock exchange, no such press release shall include
any reserve estimates.

11.6 Assignment. Prior to Closing, neither Party may assign any rights
acquired hereunder or delegate any duties assumed hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Buyer may assign
this Agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary without Seller's consent; and
any other such transfer, assignment, sublease or delegation without the other
Party's consent shall be null and void, ab initio. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the assigning Party shall remain responsible to Seller
for all obligations and liabilities under this Agreement and under the
Assignment, until expressly released by the non-assigning Party in writing.

  

  

11.7 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between Seller and Buyer with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein, and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements,
commitments, and understandings between the parties. No amendment shall be
binding unless in writing and signed by both parties. Headings used in this
Agreement are only for convenience of reference and shall not be used to
define the meaning of any provision. This Agreement is for the benefit of
Seller and Buyer and their respective successors, representatives, and assigns
and not for the benefit of third parties.

  

  

11.8 Notices. All notices and consents to be given hereunder shall be in

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas,
without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. The validity of
the conveyances affecting the title to real property shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which such

giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.

 

  

  

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the
parties hereto expressly agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources (as defined below) in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
any agreement entered into by the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts

this Section 11.9(b) shall not be applicable with respect to the enforcement
of Seller's rights and remedies under this Agreement against Buyer or its

the event the Financing Sources take a pledge of the Assets and/or this
Agreement.

 

  

  

11.10 Confidentiality. Buyer agrees that all confidential, non-public
information furnished or disclosed by Seller or acquired by Buyer from Seller
in connection with the sale of the Assets shall remain confidential prior to
Closing, provided, however, that upon Closing, Buyer shall not be obligated
under any such confidentiality obligations relating to the Assets it acquires
(and after Closing, Seller shall maintain the confidentiality, and shall not
use or disclose, any such confidential, non-public information regarding the
Assets Buyer acquires without Buyer's prior written consent). Buyer may
disclose such information only to its subsidiaries or affiliates, agents,
advisors, counsel or representatives (herein "Representatives") who have
agreed, prior to being given access to such information, to maintain the

connection with the inspection, testing, inventory or sale of the Assets shall
remain confidential, with Seller a third party beneficiary of any privilege
held by Buyer. Buyer and its Representatives shall promptly return to Seller
any and all materials and information furnished or disclosed by Seller
relating in any way to the Assets, including any notes, summaries,
compilations, analyses or other material derived from the inspection or
evaluation of such material and information, without retaining copies thereof
and destroy any information relating to the Assets and independently acquired
by Buyer. In the event of any conflict between this Section 11.10 and any
other confidentiality agreement affecting Buyer and Seller, this Section 11.10
shall control.

manner to the other party.

provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for the filing and

responsible for timely obtaining all consents and approvals of Governmental
Authorities customarily obtained subsequent to transfer of title and all costs
and fees associated therewith. Except as otherwise specifically provided, all

11.17 Removal of Signs and Markers. Seller may either remove its name and
signs from the Seller-operated Wells, facilities and Personal Property or
require Buyer, at Buyer's cost, to do so for those Assets that Buyer will
operate. If Seller's name or signs remain on the Assets after Seller ceases to
be operator and Buyer has become operator, Buyer shall (a) remove any
remaining signs and references to Seller within ninety (90) days after Seller
ceases to be operator or such earlier time as may be required by applicable
regulations, (b) install signs complying with applicable governmental
regulations, including signs showing Buyer as operator of the Assets it
operates and (c) upon Seller's request after Closing, notify Seller of the
removal and installation. Seller reserves a right of access to the Assets for

name from all Wells, facilities and Personal Property, or to confirm that
Buyer has done so for the Assets operated by Buyer.

NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) OR OTHER
FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR FROM ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT CAUSED BY THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE
EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

  

  

11.19 Waiver of Certain Damages. Each party irrevocably waives and agrees not
to seek indirect, consequential, punitive, SPECIAL or exemplary damages of any
kind in connection with any dispute arising out of or related to this

LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES IN QUESTION AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE
ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF DUTY
(STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR FROM ANY
PRE-EXISTING DEFECT. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.19 does not
diminish or otherwise affect the parties' rights and obligations to be
indemnified against, and provide indemnity for, indirect, consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages awarded to any third party for which
indemnification is provided in this Agreement or Seller's right to receive the
Deposit as liquidated damages subject to and pursuant to the provisions of

DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN), OF THE PARTIES. THIS
PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT.

implied, is intended to or will confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto, and their respective legal representatives, successors, and permitted
assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources
