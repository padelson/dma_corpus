(c) From and after the date of this Agreement and continuing until the date
that is 60 days after the Closing Date (the "Supplemental Acquisition
Period"), if Sellers acquire an oil and gas lease on lands located within the
boundaries of the maps attached hereto as **_Exhibit D_** (the "Acquisition
Area") (collectively, the "Offered Leases") prior to the expiration of the
Supplemental Acquisition Period, then Sellers shall provide Purchaser with
written notice of Sellers acquisition of such additional Offered Leases prior
to the expiration of the Supplemental Acquisition Period, and such notice
shall contain:

 



 

(i) copies of the Offered Lease(s) acquired (and any other conveyances into
Sellers covering such acquired Offered Leases);

 



 

(ii) any ownership and/or title opinions or reports covering the surface
and/or mineral estates of the acreage leased;

 



 

(iii) a statement of the Net Mineral Acres covered thereby, as well as the Net
Revenue Interest and Working Interest attributable to such Offered Leases;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) statement or summary of the pooling permitted under such Offered Lease;
and

 



 

(v) with respect to Supplemental Properties covering Net Mineral Acres in
excess of the Target Acreage, the acquisition costs associated with such
Supplemental Properties,

 



 

provided, that any such lease must have a term of not less than three years
and a Net Revenue Interest of not less than 75% in order to qualify as an
Offered Lease.

 



 

If the Target Acreage has not been attained as of the Closing Date, then until
the expiration of the Supplemental Acquisition Period, Purchaser will be
obligated to purchase Offered Leases, as they are offered, at the price per
Net Mineral Acre set forth on **_Exhibit D_** and attributable to such
Offered Leases until the Target Acreage is attained. If the Target Acreage has
been obtained, either by the Closing Date or as a result of Purchaser
purchasing Offered Leases in accordance with this **Section 1.2(c)**, then
Purchaser shall have 10 days after receipt of each such written notice to
provide Seller with written response notice whether it elects to acquire any
of such Offered Leases under the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Unless otherwise stipulated in the written notice from Sellers to
Purchaser, Seller shall be deemed to have represented (and hereby represents)
that all such Offered Leases cover lands located within the boundaries of the
Acquisition Area. Once Offered Leases have been acquired to attain the Target
Acreage as provided above (and if applicable), thereafter, Purchaser is under
no obligation to acquire any Offered Leases. To the extent that any Offered
Leases are acquired by Sellers after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the expiration of the Supplemental Acquisition Period, and Purchaser elects to
acquire them, as described above, then there shall be a supplemental closing
(the "Supplemental Closing") on a date mutually agreed to by the Parties, but
in no event earlier than 30 days or later than 45 days (subject to extension
for the resolution of any Title Defect Amounts with respect thereto) after the
expiration of the Supplemental Acquisition Period (the "Supplemental Closing
Date"), at which time, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Sellers
shall sell all of their interests in and to such Offered Leases, together with
all related interests related thereto, and otherwise on the terms set forth in
this Agreement as modified by this Section with regard thereto (collectively,
the "Supplemental Properties"). All of the representations, warranties and
covenants regarding Oil and Gas Properties and the Closing shall apply
correspondingly with regard to the Supplemental Properties and the
Supplemental Closing (and, without limitation, representations and warranties
in **Article V** shall be deemed to apply with regard to Supplemental
Properties), conditions to closing that must be satisfied or waived in
connection with the Closing, must likewise be satisfied or waived for purposes
of a Supplemental Closing, and notices that must be provided within certain
periods prior to or after the Closing in connection with the Oil and Gas
Properties, will, likewise, be required to be provided within such same
periods prior to or after the Supplemental Closing in connection with the
Supplemental Properties (and, by way of example, the notices for Title Defects
and Environmental Defects regarding the Supplemental Properties shall be due
no later than five Business Days prior to the Supplemental Closing). The
purchase price to be paid by Purchasers to Seller for the Supplemental
Properties covering Net Mineral Acres in excess of the Target Acreage accepted
by Purchaser shall be the acquisition costs incurred by Sellers for the
Supplemental Properties. Acquisition costs for Supplemental Properties include
landman and brokerage costs, bonuses and other consideration paid, pre-paid
surface damages, recording fees,

 



      
 

 



 

attorneys fees for title review, costs of title curative and any other costs
incurred by Sellers to acquire Supplemental Properties.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Assets shall not include, and there is

(g) all right, title and interest of Sellers in and to vehicles used in

(h) all rights, titles, claims and interests of a Seller or any Affiliate of a
Seller (i) to or under any policy or agreement of insurance or any insurance

under any bond or bond proceeds;

 



 

(i) subject to **Section 12.5**, any patent, patent application, logo,
service mark, copyright, trade name or trademark of or associated with a
Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller or any business of a Seller or of any
Affiliate of a Seller;

 



 

(j) all Retained Assets not conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to **Section 7.7**
and any Asset excluded pursuant to **Section 3.4**, **Section 4.3(b) **or
**Section 4.3(d)**; and

 



 

(k) all abandoned or unclaimed property reportable under or subject to any
state or local unclaimed property, escheat or similar Law where the dormancy
period elapsed prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 1.4.** **_Effective Time; Proration of Costs and Revenues._**

 



 

(a) Subject to **Section 1.5**, possession of the Assets shall be transferred
from Sellers to Purchaser at the Closing, but certain financial benefits and
burdens of the Assets shall be transferred to and assumed as described below
by Purchaser, effective as of 7:00 A.M., local time, where the Assets are
located, on January 1, 2017 (the "Effective Time").

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to (i) all Hydrocarbon production from or
allocable to the Oil and Gas Properties occurring at and after the Effective
Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other
income, proceeds, revenues, receipts and credits earned with respect to the
Oil and Gas Assets at or after the Effective Time, and all fees, rentals,
proceeds, payments, revenues, receipts, income, and credits earned with
respect to the Midstream Assets at or after the Effective Time. Purchaser
shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all
Property Costs incurred with respect to the Assets acquired by Purchaser at
and after the Effective Time. Each Seller shall be entitled to its
proportionate share of all Hydrocarbon production from or allocable to the Oil
and Gas Properties occurring prior to the Effective Time (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, revenues,
receipts, and credits earned with respect to the Oil and Gas Assets prior to
the Effective Time. Sellers shall be entitled to all fees, rentals, proceeds,
payments, revenues, receipts, income, and credits earned with respect to the
Midstream Assets prior to the Effective Time. Each Seller shall be responsible
for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property Costs incurred
with respect to the Assets owned by such Seller prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the terms "earned" and "incurred" shall be
interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of Petroleum Accountants
Society ("COPAS") standards, as applicable.

 



 

(d) As used in this Agreement, the term "Property Costs" means all costs
attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets (including costs of
insurance relating specifically to the Assets, but excluding all applicable
Taxes) and capital expenditures incurred in the ownership and operation of the
Assets, and in the case of the Oil and Gas Assets, where applicable, in
accordance with the terms of the relevant operating or unit agreement, if any,
and

 



      
 

 



 

regardless of whether charged by an Affiliate of a Seller or by a third
Person, or, if none, the amounts shown under **_Schedule 1.4_** shall be the
overhead amounts deemed charged to the Oil and Gas Assets.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this **Section 1.4**, the determination of whether
Property Costs are attributable to the period before or after the Effective
Time shall be based on when services are rendered, when the goods are
delivered, or when the work is performed. For clarification, the date an item
or work is ordered is not the date of a pre-Effective Time transaction for
settlement purposes, but rather the date on which the item ordered is
delivered to the job site, or the date on which the work ordered is performed,
shall be the relevant date. For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon production
(and accounts receivable with respect thereto) and other revenues and income
under this **Section 1.4**, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be
"from or allocable to" the Oil and Gas Properties when such Hydrocarbons are
placed into the storage facilities, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be "from or allocable to" the Oil and Gas Properties when such
Hydrocarbons pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines
through which they are gathered or, if not first gathered, transported.

 



 

(f) Sellers shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an
allocation of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data is not available. Sellers have provided to Purchaser all data
available to Sellers as of five Business Days prior to the Closing Date to
support the estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustments
to the Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 2.2**, used to determine the
Closing Payment. Property Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated
based on the number of days in the applicable period falling before and the
number of days in the applicable period falling at or after the Effective
Time, except that production, severance and similar Taxes shall be prorated
based on the number of units actually produced, purchased, or sold, or the
proceeds of such sale, as applicable, before, and at or after, the Effective
Time. In each case, each Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion
attributable to the Assets acquired by such Purchaser allocated to the period
at and after the Effective Time, and each Seller shall be responsible for the
portion attributable to the Assets owned by such Seller allocated to the
period before the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 1.5.** **_Delivery and Maintenance of Records._**

 



 

(a) Sellers shall deliver the Records (FOB at Sellers office) to Purchaser
within 15 days following termination of the Transition Services Agreement.
Purchaser shall be entitled to all original Records maintained by Sellers.
Sellers shall be entitled to keep copies of all Records; _provided, however_ ,
that from and after the Closing and except in connection with its obligations
under this Agreement, each Seller shall not, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, consultants, advisors and
other authorized representatives (with respect to each Seller, the "Subject
Representatives") not to, disclose, permit to be disclosed, use, permit to be
used, copy or permit to be copied, the Records or any trade secrets or
proprietary or confidential information to the extent relating to the Assets,
except for (i) disclosures and uses required by applicable Law or stock
exchange rules or of information that has become part of the public domain
through no action of any Seller or any Subject Representative after the
Closing, and (ii) disclosures to financial institutions or other third Persons
in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

the evaluation of financing or a sales or acquisition transaction provided
that such financial institution or other third Person is bound by an
obligation of confidentiality no less restrictive than the obligation of
confidentiality contained in this **Section 1.5** covering such information.
Purchaser shall preserve the Records following the Closing in Purchasers
offices in accordance with Purchasers record retention policy following the
Closing and, subject to the foregoing confidentiality obligations, will allow
each Seller and their respective representatives, consultants and advisors
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
the Records in order for a Seller to comply with a Tax or other legally
required reporting obligation or Tax or legal dispute with an un-Affiliated
third party for which such Seller is responsible. Any such access shall be at
the sole cost and expense of such Seller.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall, during normal business hours, make available to Purchaser
and Purchasers audit firm, KPMG, all supporting schedules, including reserve
reports and SMOG calculations, related to the Assets and prepared in
connection with the audited financial statements of Sellers parent for the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. Sellers shall also authorize Sellers
audit firm, Deloitte, to grant Purchaser and Purchasers audit firm, KPMG,
reasonable access to all workpapers related to the Assets prepared in
connection with the audited financial statements of Sellers parent for the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2. 
PURCHASE PRICE**

 



 

 **Section 2.1.** **_Purchase Price._**

 



 

The purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall be
$530,000,000, adjusted as provided in **Section 2.2**.

 



 

 **Section 2.2.** **_Adjustments to Purchase Price._**

 



 

The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted in the manner specified
below (without duplication), with all such amounts being determined in
accordance with GAAP and COPAS standards, as applicable, in order to reach the
"Adjusted Purchase Price":

 



 

(a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds actually
received by Sellers between (and including) the Effective Time and the Closing
Date (with the period between and including the Effective Time up to the
Closing Date referred to as the "Adjustment Period"): (i) proceeds from the
sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any royalties, overriding royalties or other
burdens on or payable out of production, gathering, processing and
transportation costs and any production, severance, sales, excise or similar
Taxes not reimbursed to Sellers by the purchaser of production) produced from
or attributable to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and (ii) other
proceeds earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period;

 



 

(b) Reduced to the extent provided in **Section 7.7** with respect to
Preference Rights and Retained Assets;

 



     

 



 

(c) (i) If the Parties make the election under **Section 3.4(d)(i)** with
respect to a Title Defect, subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the
Aggregate Defect Deductible, reduced by the Title Defect Amount with respect
to such Title Defect if the Title Defect Amount has been determined prior to
Closing and (ii) subject to the Individual Title Benefit Threshold and
Aggregate Benefit Deductible, increased by the Title Benefit Amount with
respect to each Title Benefit for which the Title Benefit Amount has been
determined prior to Closing;

 



 

(d) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs attributable
to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are paid by Sellers and
incurred during the Adjustment Period (including any overhead costs listed on
**_Schedule 1.4_** deemed charged to the Assets with respect to the
Adjustment Period even though not actually paid), except (i) any Property
Costs and other such costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds
in **Section 2.2(a)**, (ii) any costs incurred by Sellers in connection with
curing any Title Defect or Environmental Defect or with respect to any
casualty loss and (iii) any costs incurred as a result of any breach by any
Sellers of this Agreement;

 



 

(e) Reduced to the extent provided in **Section 3.4(d)(iii)** for any Oil and
Gas Properties excluded from the Assets pursuant to **Section 3.4(d)(iii)**
or retained by Sellers pursuant to **Section 3.4(d)(iii)** and reduced to the
extent provided in **Section 4.3** for Environmental Defects or Assets
retained by Sellers pursuant to **Section 4.3**;

 



 

(f) Reduced to the extent provided in **Section 3.5** in connection with a
casualty loss or governmental taking;

 



 

(g) To the extent the proceeds from the sale thereof have not been received by
Sellers, increased by the value of the amount of any and all Hydrocarbons
stored in tanks above the load level and gaseous Hydrocarbons that have passed
through the delivery point sales meters to Energy Transfer Company or any
other third party buyer on the pipelines through which they are gathered or,
if not first gathered, transported and attributable to the ownership and
operation of the Assets that belong to Sellers as of the Effective Time (which
value shall be computed by Sellers at the applicable third-party contract
prices for the month of January 2017 for such stored Hydrocarbons);

 



 

(h) (i) Reduced by the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate amount of
Unscheduled (Negative) Imbalances by $2.50 per mcf; and (ii) increased by the
product obtained by multiplying the aggregate amount of Unscheduled (Positive)
Imbalances by $2.50 per mcf;

 



 

(i) Reduced by the Deposit (as described in **Section 2.4** below);

 



 

(j) Reduced by an amount equal to all Suspended Funds; and

 



 

(k) Each adjustment made pursuant to **Section 2.2(a)** shall serve to
satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchasers entitlement under
**Section 1.4** to Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Oil and
Gas Properties during the Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets during the
Adjustment Period, and as such, Purchaser shall not have any separate rights
to receive any Hydrocarbon production or income, proceeds, receipts and
credits with respect to which an adjustment has been made. Similarly, the
adjustment described in **Section 2.2(d)**

 



      
 

 



 

shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchasers
obligation under **Section 1.4** to pay Property Costs and other costs
attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are incurred
during the Adjustment Period.

 



 

 **Section 2.3.** **_Allocation of Purchase Price._**

 



 

The values assigned to the Assets are set forth on **_Schedule 2.3_** (the
"Allocated Values"). Purchaser shall be responsible for assigning the
Allocated Values included on **_Schedule 2.3_** , subject to each Sellers
right to review the Allocated Values for reasonableness.

 



 

 **Section 2.4.** **_Deposit._**

 



 

(a) A deposit in the amount of $32,500,000 (the "Deposit") shall be paid on or
before one Business Day after execution of this Agreement by Purchaser, by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, to the Escrow Agent to be held
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. The Deposit
shall be credited to the Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser at the
Closing.

 



 

(b) In the event the transaction contemplated hereby is not consummated in
accordance with the terms hereof on or before the Closing Date solely because
of: (i) the failure of Purchaser to materially perform any of its obligations
hereunder, or (ii) the failure of any of Purchasers representations or
warranties hereunder to be true and correct in all material respects (without
regard to materiality qualifiers) as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing, then Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and
receive the Deposit (A) as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, (B) as
their sole and exclusive remedy for Purchasers breach of this Agreement and
(C) free of any claims by Purchaser thereto. The Parties agree that the
damages set forth in this **Section 2.4(b)** will be deemed liquidated
damages and that the amount of liquidated damages is reasonable considering
all of the circumstances existing as of the date hereof and constitute the
Parties good faith estimate of the actual damages reasonably expected to
result from Purchasers failure to tender performance on the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall execute Joint Instructions (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) consistent with the foregoing and deliver them to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(c) Subject to **Section 2.4(e)**, if this Agreement is terminated by the
mutual written agreement of the Parties, or if the Closing does not occur on
or before the Closing Date for any reason other than as set forth in **Section
2.** **4** **(** **b** **)** , then Purchaser shall be entitled to the
delivery of the Deposit, free of any claims by Sellers with respect thereto.
Seller Representative shall execute Joint Instructions consistent with the
foregoing and deliver them to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(d) In the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Parties shall have
the rights and obligations set forth in **Section 1** **0** **.2**.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchaser
fails to deliver the Deposit to the Escrow Agent within one Business Day
following the execution of this Agreement, Sellers shall be entitled to
immediately terminate this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.5.** **_Tax Allocation._**

 



 

For purposes of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law, as appropriate), the amounts paid hereunder shall be allocated among the
Assets consistently with the Allocated Values and in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Tax
Allocation"). Promptly following the determination of the Allocated Values,
Purchaser shall provide Sellers with a draft of the Tax Allocation, including
a draft of IRS Form 8594, and Sellers shall provide any comments within 30
days of receipt of such drafts, after which Purchaser shall adjust the Tax
Allocation as needed to reflect any reasonable comments. If the Purchase Price
is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Tax Allocation shall be adjusted
in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in this **Section 2.5**
by Purchaser. Purchaser and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including, but
not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the Tax
Allocation. None of Purchaser, Sellers, or their respective Affiliates shall
take any Tax position inconsistent with such Tax Allocation and none of
Purchaser, Sellers, or their respective Affiliates shall agree to any proposed
adjustment to the Tax Allocation by any Taxing authority without first giving
the other Party prior written notice and a reasonable time to respond;
_provided, however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent Purchaser or
Sellers from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing
authority based upon or arising out of the Tax Allocation, and neither
Purchaser nor Sellers shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority challenging such Tax
Allocation.

WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE CONVEYANCE**.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall convey the Assets to Purchaser pursuant to the execution and
delivery by Sellers to Purchaser, at the Closing, of an Assignment, Bill of
Sale, and Conveyance (Oil and Gas Assets) (the "Oil and Gas Conveyance") and
an Assignment, Bill of Sale, and Conveyance (Midstream Assets) (the "Midstream
Conveyance") substantially in the forms attached hereto as, respectively,
**_Exhibit B-1_** and **_Exhibit B-2_** (each a "Conveyance" and,
collectively, the "Conveyances"). Each Conveyance will contain a limited
warranty of title as set forth therein with respect to the portion of the
Assets covered thereby, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances, and
will grant to Purchaser full rights of substitution

 



      
 

 



 

and subrogation in and to all rights and actions of warranty of title which

 **Section 3.2.** **_Definitions of Title Matters._**

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" means that title of
Sellers with respect to the Units, Wells or other Assets, except for and
subject to Permitted Encumbrances that as of the Effective Time and the
Closing which:

 



 

(a) Entitles Sellers to receive an interest (expressed as a percentage or
decimal fraction) of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from any
Unit, Well or other Asset shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** (after satisfaction of
all royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests or other similar
burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons) (a "Net Revenue
Interest"), of not less than the Net Revenue Interest shown in **_Exhibit
A-1_** for such Unit, Well or other Asset (but limited to the applicable
Target Interval set forth in **_Exhibit A-1_** for such Unit, Well or other
Asset and any currently producing formation (for such Unit or Well)), except
(solely to the extent that such actions do not cause a breach of Sellers
covenants under **Section 7.6(a)**) for decreases resulting from the
establishment or amendment from and after the date hereof of pools or Units,
and except as stated in such **_Exhibit A-1_**;

 



 

(b) Obligates Sellers to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, any Unit, Well or
other Asset shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** (including the formation(s) set forth
on **_Exhibit A-1_** for such Unit, Well or other Asset) not greater than the
"working interest" percentage shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** for such Unit, Well
or other Asset, without increase throughout the period when such Unit, Well or
other Asset is producing (but limited to the applicable Target Interval set
forth in **_Exhibit A-1_** for such Unit, Well or other Asset and any
currently producing formation (for such Unit or Well)), except as stated in
**_Exhibit A-1_** and except for increases from and after the date hereof
resulting from contribution requirements with respect to non-consenting or
defaulting co-owners under applicable operating agreements and increases that
are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in such Sellers Net
Revenue Interest;

 



 

(c) Is free and clear of liens, encumbrances, obligations, security interests,
irregularities, pledges, or other defects; and

 



 

(d) With respect to the Leases, has not been the subject of any demand letters
or other written notice letters from any lessor of any Lease to any Seller or,
to Sellers knowledge, any third party operator of such Lease alleging or
otherwise indicating that such Lease and the acreage subject thereto no longer
contains a well producing in paying quantities or is no longer held by
production pursuant to the terms of such Lease.

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Defect" means any of the following:
any lien, charge, encumbrance, obligation (including contract obligation),
defect, or other matter (including without limitation a discrepancy in Net
Revenue Interest or working interest) that causes the applicable Seller not to
have Defensible Title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not
be considered Title Defects:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) defects based solely on lack of information in such Sellers files unless
information in the records of the applicable county reflect that any
information in Sellers files is incorrect;

 



 

(ii) defects arising out of lack of corporate or similar entity authorization
unless Purchaser provides affirmative written evidence that causes Purchaser
to reasonably believe that the action was not authorized and results in
another Persons superior claim of title;

 



 

(iii) defects based on a gap in Sellers chain of title in the states records
as to state Leases, or in the county records as to other Leases, unless such
gap is affirmatively shown to exist in such records by an abstract of title,
title opinion or landmans title chain or runsheet, which documents shall be
included in a Title Defect Notice;

 



 

(iv) defects based on failure to record any Lease issued by any state or
federal Governmental Body, or any assignments of such Lease, (in each case) in
the real property, conveyance or other records of the county in which such
Lease is located;

 



 

(v) defects arising out of lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly
required by applicable Laws;

 



 

(vi) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital
status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or estate
proceedings, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that causes
Purchaser to reasonably believe that such failure or omission has resulted in
another Persons superior claim of title;

 



 

(vii) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitation or
prescription; and

 



 

(viii) defects based solely on claims that a Well was drilled pursuant to an
"allocation well" permit or the failure to obtain a production sharing
agreement, as allowed by the Railroad Commission of Texas, so long as each
holder of a Lease or leasehold tract that such Well crosses has agreed in
writing to its share of Hydrocarbons produced from such Well.

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" shall mean any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest
of Sellers in any Unit, Well or other Asset shown on **_Exhibit A-1_**,
without causing a greater than proportionate increase in Sellers working
interest above that shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** as of the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 3.3.** **_Definition of Permitted Encumbrances._**

 



 

As used herein, the term "Permitted Encumbrances" means any or all of the
following:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary interests, net profit
interests, production payments, carried interests, and other burdens on
production, to the extent that any such burden does not reduce Sellers Net
Revenue Interest below that shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** or increase Sellers
working interest above that shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** without a
proportionate increase in the corresponding Net Revenue Interest;

 



 

(b) All Leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating agreements,
Hydrocarbon production sales contracts, division orders and other contracts,

extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, (i) reduce Sellers
Net Revenue Interest below that shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** or increase
Sellers working interest above that shown in **_Exhibit A-1_** without a
proportionate increase in the corresponding Net Revenue Interest or (ii)
detract in any material respect from the value of, or interfere in any
material respect with the use, ownership or operation of, the Assets subject
thereto or affected thereby (as currently used, owned and operated) and which

business;

 



 

(g) All rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other

leasehold interest to the holders of such reassignment rights prior to
surrendering or releasing such leasehold interest;

 



 

(i) Easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other

(m) Liens granted under applicable joint operating agreements and other
similar agreements listed on **_Schedule 1.2(a)(iv)_** for amounts that are

 **Section 3.4.** **_Notice of Title Defect Adjustments._**

 



 

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect prior to Closing, Purchaser must
deliver claim notices to Sellers (each a "Title Defect Notice") on or before
March 3, 2017 at 5:00 p.m. C.S.T. (the "Title Claim Date"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Purchaser agrees that it shall furnish Sellers once at the
end of every two week period until the Title Claim Date with a preliminary
Title Defect Notice if any officer of Purchaser or its Affiliates discovers or
learns of any Title Defect during such two week period, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration of the Title
Claim Date; _provided further_ that failure to provide preliminary notice of a
Title Defect shall not prejudice Purchasers right to assert any Title Defect
hereunder on or before the Title Claim Date. To be effective, each Title
Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the
alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) Leases, Units, Wells or other Assets in
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit A-1_**, as applicable, affected by the Title
Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Sellers to verify the existence of and extent of such Title Defect and the
amount by which the Allocated Value of each affected Asset is increased by
such Title Defect, provided, however, that the sufficiency or volume of
documents delivered pursuant to this **Section 3.4(a)(iv)** shall not serve
as any basis to dispute the validity of the Title Defect Notice, and (v) the
amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based. EXCEPT
FOR PURCHASERS RIGHTS UNDER THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE
CONVEYANCE, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ASSERT TITLE
DEFECTS OF WHICH EACH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN NOTICE ON OR BEFORE THE TITLE
CLAIM DATE.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date, with respect to each Title
Benefit, a notice (a "Title Benefit

 



      
 

 



 

Notice"), which notice to be effective shall include (i) a description of the
alleged Title Benefit, (ii) the Leases, Units, Wells or other Assets in
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit A-1_**, as applicable, affected by such Title
Benefit, (iii) the Allocated Value of each Lease, Unit, Well or other Asset in
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit A-1_**, as applicable, subject to such Title
Benefit, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Purchaser to
verify the existence of and extent of such Title Benefit and the amount by
which the Allocated Value of each affected Asset is increased by such Title
Benefit, provided, however, that the sufficiency or volume of documents
delivered pursuant to this **Section 3.4(b)(iv)** shall not serve as any
basis to dispute the validity of the Title Benefit Notice, and (v) the amount
by which Sellers reasonably believe the Allocated Value of each affected Asset
is increased by such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon
which Sellers belief is based.

 



 

(c) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at their
sole cost, to cure or remove Title Defects at any time prior to Closing (the
"Cure Period"), unless the Parties otherwise agree, any Title Defects of which
Sellers have been advised in writing by Purchaser. Any asserted Title Defects
which are cured within the Cure Period or waived in writing by Purchaser shall
be deemed Permitted Encumbrances hereunder.

 



 

(d) Remedies for Title Defects.

 



 

In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser in writing or
cured on or before Closing, the Parties shall mutually agree upon one of the
following remedies for such Title Defect:

 



 

(i) subject to the Individual Title Threshold and the Aggregate Defect
Deductible, have the Purchase Price reduced by an amount agreed upon ("Title
Defect Amount") pursuant to **Section 3.4(g)** by Purchaser and Sellers as
being the value of such Title Defect, taking into consideration the Allocated
Value of the Property affected by such Title Defect, the portion of the
Property affected by such Title Defect and the legal effect of such Title
Defect on the Property affected thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
methodology, terms and conditions of **Section 3.4(g)** shall control any
such determination;

 



 

(ii) have Sellers indemnify Purchaser against all liability, loss, cost and
expense resulting from such Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement
(the "Indemnity Agreement") in the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit C_**;
or

 



 

(iii) have Sellers retain the entirety of the Property that is affected by
such Title Defect, together with all Assets solely related to such Property,
in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Property and related Assets. Thereafter, Sellers shall
have 120 days after Closing in which to cure the Title Defect with respect to
such retained Property and related Assets. Any Property and related Assets so
held back from the initial Closing and retained by Sellers will be conveyed to
Purchaser (subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
**Section 8.2** with respect to such Property and related Assets) at a
delayed Closing (which shall become the new Closing Date with respect to such
Property and related

 



      
 

 



 

Assets) 10 Business Days following the date that the Title Defect is cured, at
which time Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the full Allocated Value of the
Property and related Assets (as adjusted pursuant to **Section 2.2 **through
the new Closing Date therefor), and provided further that if multiple delayed
Closings are contemplated as a result of this provision and/or **Section
7.7(c)**, the delayed Closings may be consolidated on dates mutually agreeable
to the Parties. An election to delay the Closing with respect to certain
Assets pursuant to this **Section 3.4(d)(iii)** shall not waive Sellers
right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect or to contest the Title
Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto. In the event that Sellers are
unable to cure the Title Defect with respect to any Property and related
Assets held back at the initial Closing within 120 days of the initial
Closing, then Sellers shall retain the Property and related Assets affected
thereby, such Property and related Assets shall become Excluded Assets
hereunder and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase such
Property and related Assets. Any disputes regarding whether such Title Defect
has been cured by Sellers within such 120 day cure period shall be resolved
pursuant to **Section 3.4(k)** (provided that the Title Expert shall be
selected within 15 Business Days following the end of the 120 day cure period
with respect to such dispute and all other provisions of **Section 3.4(k)**
shall apply as written).

 



 

In the event Sellers and Purchaser are unable to mutually agree upon a remedy
for any asserted Title Defect prior to Closing, then Sellers and Purchaser
shall be deemed to have selected the remedy set forth in **Section
3.4(d)(i)**. In the event Sellers and Purchaser mutually agree to select the
remedy set forth in **Section 3.4(d)(i)** (or are deemed to have selected
such remedy in accordance with the foregoing sentence) but are unable to agree
on the Title Defect Amount by the Scheduled Closing Date, then unless the
Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing the dispute shall be resolved
pursuant to the provisions of **Section 3.4(k)**.

 



 

(e) Subject to the Individual Title Benefit Threshold and the Aggregate
Benefit Deductible, with respect to each Lease, Unit, Well or other Asset in
**_Exhibit A_** or **_Exhibit A-1_**, as applicable, affected by Title
Benefits reported under **Section 3.4(b)**, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in
the Allocated Value for such Lease, Unit, Well or other Asset in **_Exhibit
A_** or **_Exhibit A-1_**, as applicable, caused by such Title Benefits, as
determined pursuant to **Section 3.4(j)**. In the event that Purchaser and
Sellers are unable to agree on the Title Benefit Amount, the affected Assets
will nevertheless be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing with no increase to the
Purchase Price for such Title Benefit, subject to Sellers right to a
subsequent adjustment in the Purchase Price for such Title Benefit as may
result under the provisions of **Section 3.4(k)**, or as may otherwise be
agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

(f) **Section 3.4(d)** shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser
with respect to Title Defects asserted by Purchaser pursuant to **Section
3.4(a)**. **Section 3.4(e)** shall be the exclusive right and remedy of
Sellers with respect to Title Benefits asserted by Sellers pursuant to
**Section 3.4(b)**.

 



 

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property (determined in
accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Schedule 2.3_** ) is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title
Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect affecting the Title
Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect results from a Seller having a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in **_Exhibit A-1_** and there is a proportional decrease in the
working interest for the affected Title Defect Property the Title Defect
Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to such Title Defect Property (determined in
accordance with **_Schedule 2.3_** ) by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the reduction in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest specified for such Title Defect Property in **_Exhibit
A-1_**;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect results from a Seller owning fewer Net Mineral Acres
in such Title Defect Property than the Net Mineral Acres specified therefor in
**_Exhibit A_**, the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product
obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such
Title Defect Property (determined in accordance with **_Schedule 2.3_** ) by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the reduction in Net Mineral Acres and the
denominator of which is the number of Net Mineral Acres specified for such
Title Defect Property in **_Exhibit A_**;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect results from any matter not described in subsections
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount
equal to the difference between the value of the Title Defect Property
affected by such Title Defect with such Title Defect and the value of such
Title Defect Property without such Title Defect (taking into account the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated in accordance with **_Schedule 2.3_**
to such Title Defect Property and the cost to cure such Title Defect if such
Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured);

 



 

(vi) if a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect a Title Defect
Property throughout the entire remaining productive life of such Title Defect
Property, such fact shall be taken into account in determining the Title
Defect Amount; and

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this **Article 3**, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects

 



     

 



 

upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property.

 



 

(h) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, if a lien affects more than one
Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect to one Title Defect
results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any other Title
Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect Property, the amount
necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense of such curative work
shall be allocated among the Title Defect Properties so affected (in the
ratios of the respective portions of the Purchase Price allocated to such
Title Defect Properties) and the amount so allocated to a Title Defect
Property shall be included only once in the Title Defect Amount.

 



 

(i) No Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to the extent
that an increase in a Sellers working interest in a Property has the effect
of proportionately increasing such Sellers Net Revenue Interest in such
Property;

 



 

(j) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall mean, with respect to
an affected Lease, Unit, Well or other Asset, the amount by which the value of
the affected Lease, Unit, Well or other Asset is enhanced by virtue of such
Title Benefit, which amount shall be determined as follows:

 



 

(i) If Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that agreed
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount.

 



 

(ii) If the Title Benefit Amount results from a Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Unit, Well or other Asset than the Net Revenue
Interest specified therefor in **_Exhibit A-1_** with a proportional increase
in the working interest of the affected Unit, Well or other Asset, the Title
Benefit Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Unit, Well or other Asset
(determined in accordance with **_Schedule 2.3_** ) by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the increase in the Net Revenue Interest and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Unit, Well
or other Asset in **_Exhibit A-1_**.

 



 

(iii) if the Title Benefit results from a Seller owning greater Net Mineral
Acres in such Lease than the Net Mineral Acres specified therefor in
**_Exhibit A_**, the Title Benefit Amount shall be equal to the product
obtained by multiplying the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such
Lease (determined in accordance with **_Schedule 2.3_** ) by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the increase in Net Mineral Acres and the denominator of
which is the number of Net Mineral Acres specified for such Title Defect
Property in **_Exhibit A_**;

 



 

(iv) If the Title Benefit results from any matter not described in subsections
(i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be an amount equal to
the difference between the value of the Property affected by such Title
Benefit and the value of such Property without such Title

 



      
 

 



 

Benefit (taking into account the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to
such Property in accordance with **_Schedule 2.3_** ).

 



 

(v) In determining the amount of Title Benefit Amounts, the principles and
methodology set forth in **Section 3.4(g)** shall generally be applied,
_mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

(k) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree on all Title
Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts prior
to the Scheduled Closing Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by
the Scheduled Closing Date, the Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect
Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this **Section 3.4(k)**; in addition, should the Parties
dispute whether or not any Title Defect has been cured by Sellers, such
dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this **Section
3.4(k)**, in each case as follows:

 



 

(i) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at
least 10 years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the
regional area in which the relevant Oil and Gas Properties are located and who
shall not have performed professional services for either Party or any of
their respective Affiliates during the previous three years, as selected by
mutual agreement of Purchaser and Sellers within 15 Business Days after the
Applicable Date (and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association) (the "Title Expert"). Within 10 Business
Days following the selection of the Title Expert, each of Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall submit to the Title Expert
written explanations of their respective positions in the disputed title
matters. The Title Experts determination shall be made within 15 Business
Days after submission of the title matters in dispute and shall be final and
binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Expert shall be bound by the provisions of this
**Article 3**, and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the
Title Expert are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The
Title Expert may allow the Parties to make written submissions of their
positions in the manner and to the extent the Title Expert deems appropriate,
and the Title Expert may call on the Parties to submit such other materials as
the Title Expert deems helpful and appropriate to resolution of the dispute.
Additionally, the Title Expert may consult with and engage disinterested third
parties to advise the Title Expert, including without limitation petroleum
engineers. The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed title matters submitted by either Party and
may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any
matter. Any determination by the Title Expert of an amount in dispute must be
the amount proposed either by Sellers or by Purchaser, or be a compromise
between the two proposed amounts. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear their
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. The costs and expenses
of the Title Expert shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and

 



      
 

 



 

one-half by Purchaser, including any costs incurred by the Title Expert that
are attributable to such third party consultation.

 



 

(ii) If the Title Defect Amounts alleged by Purchaser that are applicable to
the disputed title matters that are not resolved prior to the Scheduled
Closing Date, when taken together with the other adjustments to the Purchase
Price described in **Section 8.1(** **f** **) ** and **Section 8.2(** **f**
**) **(including any Environmental Defect Amounts alleged by Purchaser
pursuant to **Section 4.3) **that are not resolved prior to the Scheduled
Closing Date, exceed 20% of the Purchase Price, then the date for Closing
shall be extended until the disputed title matters are resolved pursuant to
**Section 3.4(k)(i)**. Upon resolution of such disputed title matters
pursuant to **Section 3.4(k)(i)**, then, subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Closing shall occur on the 10th Business Day
following the date upon which the Title Expert delivers written notice to
Purchaser and Sellers of his determination with respect to any disputed title
matters, including any applicable Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit
Amount.

 



 

(iii) If the Title Defect Amounts alleged by Purchaser that are applicable to
the disputed title matters that are not resolved prior to the Scheduled
Closing Date, when taken together with the other adjustments to the Purchase
Price described in **Section 8.1(** **f** **)** and **Section 8.2(** **f**
**) **(including any Environmental Defect Amounts alleged by Purchaser
pursuant to **Section 4.3)**, are equal to or less than 20% of the Purchase
Price, then the affected Assets will nevertheless be conveyed to Purchaser at
Closing with no reduction in the Purchase Price for any such Title Defect and
a portion of the Purchase Price equal to the disputed Title Defect Amount
alleged by Purchaser shall be placed in escrow by Purchaser pursuant to an
escrow agreement in a form to be mutually agreed upon by Seller
Representative, Purchaser and JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA as escrow agent. The
Purchase Price shall be subject to a subsequent adjustment for any such Title
Defect upon the resolution of such disputed title matters pursuant to
**Section 3.4(k)(i)** or as may be otherwise be mutually agreed by the
Parties. Upon such resolution of such disputed title matters pursuant to
**Section 3.4(k)(i)**, then (A) Purchaser and Seller Representative shall
instruct escrow agent to deliver to Sellers the amount, if any, so awarded by
the Title Expert to Sellers, plus interest accrued on such amount pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, if any, and (B) Purchaser and Seller
Representative shall instruct escrow agent to pay to Purchaser the amount, if
any, so awarded by the Title Expert to Purchaser, plus interest accrued on
such amount pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement, if any.

 



 

(iv) If any title disputed matter under this Article 3 relates to whether or
not any Title Defect has been cured post-Closing pursuant to **Section
3.4(d)(iii)**, then such title disputed matter shall be resolved pursuant to
the determination of the Title Expert pursuant to **Section 3.4(k)(i).**

 



      
 

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers
for any individual uncured Title Defect affecting a Title Defect Property for
which the Title Defect Amount therefor does not exceed $75,000 ("Individual
Title Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Sellers for uncured Title Defects
unless the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured Title
Defects, taken together with the aggregate Environmental Defect Amounts
attributable to all uncured Environmental Defects, exceeds a deductible in an
amount equal to 1.25% of the unadjusted Purchase Price ("Aggregate Defect
Deductible"), after which point adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies shall be made available to Purchaser only with respect to uncured
Title Defects and uncured Environmental Defects where the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts are in excess of such
Aggregate Defect Deductible; for the avoidance of doubt, Title Defect Amounts
and Environmental Defect Amounts which do not meet the Individual Title
Threshold and the Individual Environmental Threshold shall not be included in
reaching the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any individual Title Benefit for a
Property for which the Title Benefit Amount therefor does not exceed $75,000
("Individual Title Benefit Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price for Title Benefits unless the aggregate
Title Benefits attributable to all Title Benefits exceeds a deductible in an
amount equal to 1.25% of the unadjusted Purchase Price ("Aggregate Benefit
Deductible"), after which point adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be
made available to Sellers only with respect to Title Benefits where the
aggregate Title Benefit Amounts are in excess of such Aggregate Benefit
Deductible; for the avoidance of doubt, Title Benefit Amounts which do not
meet the Individual Title Benefit Threshold shall not be included in reaching
the Aggregate Benefit Deductible.

 



 

(n) If the aggregate upward adjustment (if any) of the Purchase Price which
will result from adjustments related to Title Benefit Amounts pursuant to this
**Section 3.4** (net of any downward adjustments for any Title Defects)
exceeds 5% of the Purchase Price (the "Maximum Upward Adjustment"), Purchaser
may elect, in its sole discretion, to deem one or more Assets subject to a
Title Benefit to be Excluded Assets for purposes of this Agreement, such that
the upward adjustment of the Purchase Price due to Title Benefit Amounts is
less than the Maximum Upward Adjustment.

 



 

 **Section 3.5.** **** **_Casualty or Condemnation Loss._**

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, but subject to the provisions of
**Section 3.5(b)**, Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to
production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including but not limited
to the watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any
Well) and the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear
with respect to the Assets.

 



 

(b) If, prior to the Closing Date, all or a material part of any of the Assets
are damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, storm or other casualty or are taken
in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain, or if proceedings for
such purposes shall be pending or

 



      
 

 



 

threatened, Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of the nature
and extent of such casualty loss or government taking and Sellers estimate of
the cost required to repair or replace that portion of the Assets affected by
the casualty loss or value of the Assets taken or threatened to be taken by
the government. If all or any portion of the Assets are affected by a casualty
loss or government taking, the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the
agreed cost required to repair or replace that portion of the Assets affected
by the casualty loss or the agreed value of the Assets taken or threatened to
be taken by the government, and the Parties will proceed with Closing, subject
to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that if the
Parties mutually agree, in lieu of adjustments to the Purchase Price, Sellers
shall (i) pay over to Purchaser: (A) all insurance proceeds payable to Sellers
with respect to any such casualty loss (if applicable), (B) all sums paid to
Sellers by third parties by reason of any such casualty loss (if applicable),
and (C) all compensation paid to Sellers with respect to any such government
taking (if applicable), and (ii) assign to Purchaser any and all claims that
Seller may have against any third party with respect to such casualty loss or
government taking, as applicable.

 



 

 **Section 3.6.** **_Limitations on Applicability._**

 



 

The right of Purchaser to assert a Title Defect under this Agreement and
Sellers rights to assert a Title Benefit under this Agreement shall terminate
as of the Title Claim Date, provided there shall be no termination of
Purchasers or Sellers rights under **Section 3.4** with respect to any bona
fide Title Defect properly reported in a Title Defect Notice or bona fide
Title Benefit Claim properly reported in a Title Benefit Notice on or before
the Title Claim Date.

 



 

 **Section 3.7.** **_Government Approvals Respecting Assets._**

 



 

(a) _Federal and State Approvals_. Purchaser shall, within 30 days after
Closing and at Purchasers own expense, file for approval with the applicable
Governmental Bodies all assignment documents and other state and federal
transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of the Assets
representing state or federal Leases or other Lands. Purchaser further agrees,
promptly after Closing, to take all other actions reasonably required of
Purchaser by federal or state agencies having jurisdiction to obtain all
requisite regulatory approvals with respect to this transaction with respect
to Assets representing state or federal Leases or other Lands, and to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval by such federal or
state agencies, as applicable, of Sellers assignment documents requiring such
federal or state approval in order for Purchaser to be recognized by the
federal or state agencies as the owner of the Assets representing state or
federal Leases or other Lands. Purchaser shall provide each Seller with
approved copies of such assignment documents and other state and federal
transfer documents, as soon as they are available.

 



 

(b) _Title Pending Governmental Approvals_. Until all of the governmental
approvals provided for in **Section 3.7(a)** have been obtained, the
following shall occur with respect to the affected portion of the Assets
representing state or federal Leases or other Lands:

 



 

(i) Sellers shall continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets as nominee for Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall be entitled to all economic benefits of ownership of the affected
Assets;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for all Assumed Seller Obligations with
respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets as if
Purchaser was the record owner of such Leases and other portion of the Assets
as of the Effective Time;

 



 

(iii) Sellers shall act as Purchasers nominee but shall be authorized to act
only upon and in accordance with Purchasers instructions, and Sellers shall
have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of
the Assets other than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in
nature, unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Purchaser in
writing;

 



 

(iv) Sellers shall not be obligated to incur any expenses in Sellers capacity
as nominee for the benefit of Purchaser under this **Section 3.7(b)**, and,
provided that Sellers give Purchaser prior written notice of any expenses that
Sellers are required to incur to comply with their obligations under the
applicable Leases or applicable Law, Purchaser agrees to pay or reimburse
Sellers for any such expenses promptly upon receiving notice thereof; and

 



 

(v) For purposes of **Article 11**, Sellers and Purchaser shall treat and
deal with such affected Leases and other affected portions of the Assets as if
full legal and equitable title to the same had passed from Sellers to
Purchaser at Closing.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

 **Section 4.1.** **_Assessment._**

 



 

From and after the date of execution of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
each Seller shall afford to Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives access
to the Assets, including the Records in accordance with **Section 7.1**. Upon
reasonable notice to Sellers, Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I
environmental property assessment of the Assets that satisfies the basic
assessment requirements set forth under the current American Society for
Testing and Material Standard Practice for Phase I environmental property
assessments (Designation E1527-13) but such Phase I environmental property
assessment shall not include any environmental sampling or testing (the "Phase
I Assessment" or "Phase I, " whether one or more). The Phase I Assessment and
Purchasers other diligence activities shall be conducted at the sole cost,
risk and expense of Purchaser, and shall be subject to the indemnity
provisions of **Section 4.4**. Each Seller or its respective designee shall
have the right to accompany Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives whenever
they are onsite on Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Purchaser shall not have access to, and shall not be permitted to conduct any
environmental due diligence (including all or any part of the Phase I
Assessments) with respect to any Assets where Sellers or their Affiliates do
not have the authority to grant access for such due diligence; _provided,
however_ , Sellers and their Affiliates shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain permission from any other Person to allow
Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives such access and the ability to
conduct environmental due diligence

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance herewith and as long as Sellers and their Affiliates have
exercised such commercially reasonable efforts, Sellers shall have no
liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain any such other Persons
permission. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall
not have the right to conduct any Phase II environmental property assessments
or such other activities intended to constitute the conduct of "all
appropriate inquiries" under 40 CFR Part 312 without the prior written consent
of Sellers; _provided, however_ , that if any Seller fails to provide such
written consent, then Purchaser shall have the option to (a) withdraw its
request to perform such Phase II assessment or (b) cause Sellers to retain the
affected Asset, in which event such Asset will become an Excluded Asset
hereunder, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Asset and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase such Asset.
Purchaser and Sellers shall maintain, and shall cause their respective
officers, employees, representatives, consultants and advisors to maintain,
all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Phase I or other due
diligence activity as strictly confidential until the Closing occurs (and
thereafter, with respect to Sellers if Closing occurs), unless disclosure of
any facts discovered through such Phase I or other due diligence activity is
required under any Laws. Purchaser shall provide each Seller with a copy of
the final version of all environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of,
Purchaser with respect to any Phase I activity conducted on the Oil and Gas
Properties. In the event that any necessary disclosures under applicable Laws
are required before Closing with respect to matters discovered by any Phase I
activity conducted by, for or on behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that
Sellers shall be the responsible Parties for disclosing such matters to the
appropriate Governmental Bodies; _provided that_ , if Sellers fail to promptly
make such disclosure and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is legally
obligated to make such disclosure, Purchaser or any such Affiliate shall have
the right to fully comply with such legal obligation.

 



 

 **Section 4.2.** **_NORM, Wastes and Other Substances._**

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for the exploration,
development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Oil and Gas Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and
sites included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on, in or under the Oil and Gas Properties or included in the Assets
may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM. Hazardous Materials,
including NORM, may have come in contact with various environmental media,
including without limitation, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may
be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or
disposal of environmental media and Hazardous Materials, including NORM, from
the Assets.

 



 

 **Section 4.3.** **_Environmental Defects._**

 



 

(a) If, as a result of its investigation pursuant to **Section 4.1**,
Purchaser determines that with respect to the Assets, there exists an
Environmental Liability with respect to any Asset (other than with respect to
NORM) (in each case an "Environmental Defect"), then on or prior to March 3,
2017 at 5:00 p.m. C.S.T. (the "Environmental Claim Date"), Purchaser may
notify each Seller in writing of such Environmental Defect (an "Environmental
Defect Notice"). **EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO PURCHASER S RIGHTS FOR ANY **

 



      
 

 



 

 **BREACH BY SELLERS OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 5.9 OR ANY
BREACH BY SELLERS OF THEIR COVENANTS HEREUNDER, FOR ALL PURPOSES OF THIS
AGREEMENT, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT
WHICH PURCHASER FAILS TO ASSERT AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL
DEFECT NOTICE RECEIVED BY EACH SELLER ON OR BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM
DATE**. To be effective, each such notice must set forth (i) a description of
the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) the Units,
Wells and associated Assets affected by the Environmental Defect, (iii) the
estimated Lowest Cost Response to eliminate the Environmental Defect in
question (the "Environmental Defect Amount") and (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Sellers to verify the existence of the alleged
Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect Amount, provided, however,
that the sufficiency or volume of documents delivered pursuant to this
**Section 4.3(a)(iv)** shall not serve as any basis to dispute the validity
of the Environmental Defect Notice. Purchaser agrees that it shall furnish
Sellers once at the end of every two week period until the Environmental Claim
Date with a preliminary Environmental Defect Notice if any officer of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates discovers or learns of any Environmental
Defect during such two week period, which notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to the expiration of the Environmental Claim Date;
_provided further_ that failure to provide preliminary notice of an
Environmental Defect shall not prejudice Purchasers right to assert any
Environmental Defect hereunder on or before the Environmental Claim Date.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any
Environmental Defect before Closing or, provided that the Parties shall have
mutually agreed to the general plan of remediation with respect to such
Environmental Defect and the time period by which such remediation shall take
place, after Closing. If Sellers disagree with any of Purchasers assertions
with respect to the existence of an Environmental Defect or the Environmental
Defect Amount or the cure thereof prior to the Scheduled Closing Date,
Purchaser and Sellers will attempt to resolve the dispute prior to the
Scheduled Closing Date. If such dispute or any dispute among the Parties on
whether or not any Environmental Defect has been cured by Sellers by the
Scheduled Closing Date (unless the Parties have mutually agreed to allow
Sellers to cure such Environmental Defect after Closing) has not been resolved
by the Scheduled Closing Date, then such matters remaining in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this **Section 4.3(b) **as
follows:

 



 

(i) The Parties shall submit such dispute to an environmental consultant
approved in writing by Sellers and Purchaser (and absent such mutual approval,
appointed by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association) that
is experienced in environmental corrective action at oil and gas properties in
the regional area where the relevant Oil and Gas Properties are located and
that shall not have performed professional services for either Party or any of
their respective Affiliates during the previous three years (the "Independent
Expert"). Within 10 Business Days following the selection of the Independent
Expert, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
shall submit to the Independent Expert written explanations of their
respective positions in the disputed environmental matters. The Independent

 



      
 

 



 

Expert may elect to conduct the dispute resolution proceeding by written
submissions from Purchaser and Sellers with exhibits, including
interrogatories, supplemented with appearances by Purchaser and Sellers, if
necessary, as the Independent Expert may deem necessary. After the Parties and
Independent Expert have had the opportunity to review all such submissions,
the Independent Expert shall call for a final, written offer of resolution
from each Party. The Independent Expert shall render its decision within 15
Business Days of receiving such offers by selecting one or the other of the
offers, or by crafting a decision that represents a compromise between the two
offers.

 



 

(ii) If the Environmental Defect Amounts alleged by Purchaser that are
applicable to the disputed environmental matters that are not resolved prior
to the Scheduled Closing Date, when taken together with the other adjustments
to the Purchase Price described in **Section 8.1(** **f** **)** and
**Section 8.2(** **f** **) **(including any Title Defect Amounts alleged by
Purchaser pursuant to **Article 3) **that are not resolved prior to the
Scheduled Closing Date, exceed 20% of the Purchase Price, then the date for
Closing shall be extended until the disputed environmental matters are
resolved pursuant to **Section 4.3(b)(i)**. Upon resolution of such disputed
environmental matters pursuant to **Section 4.3(b)(i)**, then, subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Closing shall occur on the
10th Business Day following the date upon which the Independent Expert
delivers written notice to Purchaser and Sellers of his determination with
respect to any disputed environmental matters, including any applicable
Environmental Defect Amount.

 



 

(iii) If the Environmental Defect Amounts alleged by Purchaser that are
applicable to the disputed environmental matters that are not resolved prior
to the Scheduled Closing Date, when taken together with the other adjustments
to the Purchase Price described in **Section 8.1(** **f** **) ** and
**Section 8.2(** **f** **) **(including any Title Defect Amounts alleged by
Purchaser pursuant to **Article 3)**, are equal to or less than 20% of the
Purchase Price, then the Assets affected by such Environmental Defects shall
be retained by Sellers at Closing, in which event the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Assets. If the
Allocated Value of an Asset so held back from the initial Closing is greater
than the Environmental Defect Amount determined by the Independent Expert or
agreed by the Parties, then such Asset will be conveyed to Purchaser (subject
to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in **Section 8.2** with
respect to such Asset) at a delayed Closing (which shall become the new
Closing Date with respect to such Asset) within 10 Business Days following the
date that the Independent Expert delivers written notice to Purchaser and
Sellers of his award with respect to such Environmental Defect and/or
Environmental Defect Amount, at which time Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the
full Allocated Value of the Asset less such Environmental Defect Amount (as
adjusted pursuant to **Section 2.2 **through the new Closing Date therefor
with respect to such Asset). If the Allocated Value of an Asset so held back
from the initial Closing is less than the Environmental Defect Amount
determined by the Independent Expert, then such Asset will be retained by
Seller, such Asset will become an Excluded

 



      
 

 



 

Asset hereunder and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase
such Asset.

 



 

(c) The Independent Expert may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter. The decision of the Independent
Expert shall be final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal.
Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case to the Independent Expert. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by
Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Subject to **Section 4.3(b)** and the following provisions of this
**Section 4.3(d)**, the Parties shall adjust the Purchase Price to reflect
the Environmental Defect Amounts, as agreed by the Parties or as determined by
the Independent Expert, as applicable, for all uncured Environmental Defects;
_provided that_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for any individual
uncured Environmental Defect (affecting one or more Assets) for which the
Environmental Defect Amounts therefor do not exceed $75,000 ("Individual
Environmental Threshold"); (ii) if the Parties agree or the Independent Expert
determines that the Environmental Defect Amount with respect to any Asset
exceeds the Allocated Value thereof, then Sellers shall retain the affected
Asset, such Asset will become an Excluded Asset hereunder, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset and Purchaser shall have
no further obligation to purchase such Asset, (iii) if the Environmental
Defect Amounts for all Environmental Defects affecting any Asset, when
combined with the Title Defect Amounts for all Title Defects affecting the
same Asset, exceeds the Allocated Value of such affected Asset then Sellers
shall retain the affected Asset, such Asset will become an Excluded Asset
hereunder, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Asset and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to purchase such Asset,
and (iv) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price for
any uncured Environmental Defect unless the aggregate Environmental Defect
Amounts attributable to all such Environmental Defects, taken together with
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to all uncured Title Defects,
exceed the Aggregate Defect Deductible, after which point Purchaser shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with
respect to uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental Defects where the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts attributable
thereto are in excess of such Aggregate Defect Deductible; for the avoidance
of doubt, Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts which do not
meet the Individual Title Threshold and the Individual Environmental Threshold
shall not be included in reaching the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 



 

 **Section 4.4.** **_Inspection Indemnity._**

 



 

 **PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, PROTECT, SAVE AND
HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL
LOSSES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, ANY DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED ON
THE ASSETS BY PURCHASER OR ITS AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES, WHETHER BEFORE OR
AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH LOSSES ARE
CAUSED BY THE WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL CONDUCT OF**

 



     

 

 ** **

 

 **A SELLER OR ITS AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES.** The indemnity obligation set
forth in this **Section 4.4** shall survive the Closing or termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS**

 



 

 **Section 5.1.** **_Generally._**

 



 

(a) Any representation or warranty qualified "to the knowledge of Sellers" or
"to Sellers knowledge" or with any similar knowledge qualification is limited
to matters within the Actual Knowledge of the officers and employees of each
Seller who have direct responsibility for the Assets, as specified on
**_Schedule 5.1_**. "Actual Knowledge", for purposes of this Agreement, means
information actually and personally known by the individuals specified on
**_Schedule 5.1_** after due investigation, in their individual capacities and
as officers and employees of any Seller or its Affiliates. Inclusion of a
matter on a Schedule to a representation or warranty which addresses matters
possibly having a Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed an indication
that such matter does, or may, have a Material Adverse Effect. Likewise, the
inclusion of a matter on a Schedule in relation to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an indication that such matter necessarily would,
or may, breach such representation or warranty absent its inclusion on such
Schedule. Matters may be disclosed on a Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement
for purposes of information only. Nothing in the Schedules of Sellers is
intended to broaden the scope or effect of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the Schedules constitutes an admission
of any liability or obligation to any third Person, or an admission to any
third Person against the interest of Sellers. Descriptions of or references to
particular contracts, agreements, notices and other documents herein are
qualified in their entirety by reference to such documents. Certain sections
of this Agreement may be qualified by the matters set forth in the related
Schedule, and the disclosure of any fact or item in any of the Schedules
shall, should the existence of such fact or item be relevant to any other of
the Schedules or sections in this Agreement, be deemed to be disclosed with
respect to that other section or Schedule, in each case as long as it is
readily apparent on its face. In disclosing information pursuant to the
Schedules, no Seller waives any attorney-client privilege associated with such
information or any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine.

 



 

(b) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this **Section 5.1**, the
disclaimers and waivers contained in **Section 11.9** and the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Sellers, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to Purchaser the matters set out in the remainder of this **Article
5**.

by all necessary action on the part of each Seller. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by each Seller (and all documents required
hereunder to be executed and delivered by any Seller at Closing will be duly
executed and delivered by such Seller) and this Agreement constitutes, and at
the Closing such documents will constitute, the valid and binding obligations
of each Seller, enforceable against each Seller in accordance with their terms
subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
and other similar Laws of general application with respect to creditors, (ii)
general principles of equity and (iii) the power of a court to deny
enforcement of remedies generally based on public policy.

 



 

 **Section 5.5.** **_No Conflicts._**

 



 

Subject to compliance with or waiver of the Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements set forth in **_Schedule 5.13_**, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by each Seller, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) violate any provision of the
certificate of formation or incorporation, as applicable, bylaws or limited
liability company agreement or any similar governing document of any Seller,
(ii) result in default (with due notice or lapse of time or both) or the
creation of any lien or encumbrance or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any note, bond, mortgage or indenture to which any Seller is a party or
which affect the Assets, (iii) violate any judgment, order, ruling, or decree
applicable to any Seller as a party in interest, (iv) violate any Laws

by, required notices to, filings with, approval or authorizations of, or other
actions by any Governmental Body where the same are not required prior to the
assignment of the related Asset and that are customarily obtained subsequent
to the sale or conveyance thereof.

 



 

 **Section 5.6.** **_Liability for Brokers  Fees._**

 



 

Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly have any responsibility, liability

statements (including estimated reports, returns or statements), and other
similar filings relating to Sellers acquisition, ownership or operation of

jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed, and all such
Tax Returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects, and all

statute.

 



 

(c) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not terminate any Tax

Liabilities with respect to the Assets or any demands to clean-up any portion
of the Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in this
**Section 5.9**, Sellers make no representation or warranty, express or
implied, relating to any Environmental Liabilities or Environmental Laws.

 



 

 **Section 5.10.** **_Contracts._**

 



 

All Material Contracts are included within the list of Contracts in
**_Schedule 1.2(a)(iv)_** and **_Schedule 1.2(b)(vi)_**. Sellers are in
material compliance with and, to Sellers knowledge, all counterparties are in
material compliance with, all Material Contracts, except as disclosed on
**_Schedule 5.10_**. Except as set forth on **_Schedule 5.10_** , no event

the Imbalances of Sellers arising with respect to the Assets or production
therefrom and, except as disclosed in **_Schedule 5.16_,** (i) no Person is
entitled to receive any material portion of any Sellers Hydrocarbons produced

receive, prepayments (including payments for gas not taken pursuant to "take-
or-pay" arrangements) for any of Sellers share of the Hydrocarbons produced

deliver Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties after the
Effective Time without then or thereafter receiving payment therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.17.** **_Condemnation._**

allocable to the Oil and Gas Properties, and, except as set forth on
**_Schedule 5.21_** , all Contracts for the sale of Hydrocarbons are
terminable without penalty on no more than 30 days prior notice. Except as

terms of any Hydrocarbon sales, gathering, processing, transportation, or
similar agreement, or any obligation under any such agreement to pay any
capacity charge, reservation charge, through-put fee, or similar charge or fee
without regard to the quantity of Hydrocarbons actually delivered. To the
knowledge of Sellers, all proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons attributable
to the interests of each Seller in the Oil and Gas Properties have been and
are being disbursed to such Seller under appropriate division orders, transfer
orders, or similar documents signed by or otherwise binding on such Seller,
and no portion of any such proceeds is being held in suspense, subject to a

The Field Employee List also specifies, for each Field Employee, whether the
Field Employee is on Leave and in the case of a Field Employee on Leave, the
current expected return-to-work date if known by Sellers. Sellers shall

Agreement, result in any Taxes in respect of the employment or engagement of
any Field Employee prior to the Closing owed by or imposed upon, or
"controlled group liability" to, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. As used
in the preceding sentence, the term "controlled group liability" means any and
all liabilities and Losses (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302
of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code or (iv) under the Coal
Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.

of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Purchaser (and all documents required hereunder to

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) violate any
provision of the organizational documents of Purchaser, (ii) result in a
default (with due notice or lapse of time or both) or the creation of any lien

 **Section 6.5.** **_Liability for Brokers  Fees._**

 



 

Sellers shall not directly or indirectly have any responsibility, liability or
expense, as a result of undertakings or agreements of Purchaser or its

 **Section 6.6.** **_Litigation._**

 



 

There are no Proceedings pending, or to the Actual Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened in writing before any Governmental Body against Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser which are reasonably likely to materially impair

 **Section 6.7.** **_Limitation and Independent Evaluation._**

 



 

 **Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by each Seller
in Article 5 of this Agreement, or in the Conveyances or in any certificate
furnished or to be furnished to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and
absent fraud by any Seller, Purchaser acknowledges that (a) there are no
representations or warranties, express, statutory or implied, as to the Assets
or prospects thereof made by any Seller, and (b) Purchaser has not relied upon
any oral or written information provided by Sellers. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, subject to Section 5.9, Purchaser acknowledges
that no Seller has made nor will make any representation or warranty regarding
any matter or circumstance relating to Environmental Laws, Environmental
Liabilities, the release of materials into the environment or protection of
human health, safety, natural resources or the environment or any other
environmental condition of the Assets.** Purchaser further acknowledges that
it is knowledgeable of the oil and gas business and of the usual and customary
practices of producers such as Seller, and that it has retained and taken
advice concerning the Assets and transactions herein from advisors and
consultants which are knowledgeable about the oil and gas business, and that
is aware of the risks inherent in the oil and gas business. Subject to
Sellers compliance with **Section 4.1**, Purchaser acknowledges that it has
or will have access to the Assets, the officers and employees of Sellers, and
the books, records and files made available by Sellers relating to the Assets,
and in making the decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser has relied solely on the
representations of Sellers contained in **Article 5** and the basis of its
own independent evaluation and due diligence investigation of the Assets, and
its own independent evaluation of the business, economic, legal, tax, or other
consequences of this transaction including its own estimate and appraisal of
the extent and value of the oil, natural gas, and other reserves attributable
to the Oil and Gas Properties.

 



 

 **Section 6.8.** **_SEC Disclosure._**

 



 

Purchaser is acquiring the Oil and Gas Properties for its own account for use
in its trade or business, and not with a view toward or for sale associated
with any distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of making a
distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act and applicable
state securities Laws. Purchaser understands and acknowledges that: (a) an
investment

 



 

in the Assets involves certain risks; and (b) neither the SEC nor any federal,
state or foreign agency has passed upon the Assets or made any finding or
determination as to the fairness of an investment in the Assets or the
accuracy or adequacy of the disclosures made to Purchaser.

There are no bankruptcy, reorganization or receivership proceedings pending
against, or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, being contemplated by, or

giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, solvent.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.10.** **_Qualification._**

 



 

As of Closing, Purchaser will be qualified to own and assume operatorship of
the Leases in the jurisdictions where the Assets to be transferred to
Purchaser are located, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

or operator. To the extent required by applicable Law, as of the Closing,
Purchaser will have lease bonds, area-wide bonds or any other surety bonds as
may be required by, and in accordance with, such Law (or other requirements)
governing the ownership and operation of the Assets.

 **ARTICLE 7. 
COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1.** **_Access._**

 



 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement up to and including the date the
Records are delivered to Purchaser pursuant to **Section 1.5** **(a)** (or
the earlier termination of this Agreement), Sellers shall cooperate with
Purchaser and provide Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, consultants, advisors and
other authorized representatives ("Purchasers Representatives"), access to
the Assets, the Records, and the Field Employees, but only to the extent that
Sellers may do so without violating any obligations to any un-Affiliated third
party or any Laws and to the extent that Sellers have authority to grant such
access without breaching any restriction legally or contractually binding on
Sellers; _provided, however_ , that each Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents or approvals from un-
Affiliated third parties or applicable Governmental Bodies in order to provide
Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives such access. Purchaser shall conduct
all such inspections and other information gathering described above only (i)
(x) during regular business hours and (y) during any weekends and after hours
requested by Purchaser that can be reasonably accommodated by Seller, and (ii)
in a manner which will not unduly interfere with Sellers operation of the
Assets. All information obtained by Purchaser and its representatives pursuant
to this **Section 7.1** shall be subject to the terms of that certain
confidentiality agreement dated December 13, 2016 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), by and between Halcon Resources Corporation (Sellers parent) and
Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that if the Closing should occur, the
foregoing confidentiality restriction on Purchaser, including the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to the Excluded Assets).
Sellers shall also make available to Purchaser and Purchasers
Representatives, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, Sellers
personnel knowledgeable with respect to the Assets (including the Field
Employees) in order that Purchaser may make such diligence investigation as
Purchaser considers necessary or appropriate.

SECURITIES LAWS (WHETHER NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT). TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR PURCHASERS RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE
REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN **ARTICLE 5** OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SPECIAL
WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE CONVEYANCES AND EXCLUDING FRAUD BY ANY
SELLER, ANY RELIANCE UPON OR CONCLUSIONS DRAWN BY PURCHASER FROM SUCH
MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION SHALL BE AT PURCHASERS RISK AND
SHALL NOT GIVE RISE TO ANY LIABILITY OF OR AGAINST SELLERS, AND PURCHASER
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OTHER THAN
THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN **ARTICLE 5** OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE CONVEYANCES.
EXCEPT FOR PURCHASERS RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF SELLERS SET FORTH IN **ARTICLE 5** OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE CONTAINED IN THE CONVEYANCES AND THE INDEMNITY
OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND EXCLUDING FRAUD BY ANY SELLER,

COMMON LAW OR ANY STATUTE (WHETHER NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO ANY MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS OR INFORMATION PROVIDED TO PURCHASER IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

 **Section 7.2.** **_Government Reviews._**

 



 

Sellers and Purchaser shall in a timely manner (i) make all required filings,
if any, with, prepare applications to and conduct negotiations with, each
Governmental Body as to which such filings, applications or negotiations by
such Party are necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) provide such information to the
other Parties as Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, may reasonably request
to make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations.
Each Party shall cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the other Parties with respect to such filings, applications and
negotiations.

 



 

 **Section 7.3.** **_Notification of Breaches._**

 



 

Until the Closing,

 



 

41

      
 

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Sellers promptly after Purchaser obtains Actual
Knowledge that any representation or warranty of a Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date, or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by a Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



 

(b) Sellers shall notify Purchaser promptly after any Seller obtains Actual
Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date, or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



 

(c) If any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchasers or Sellers
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but
if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured by the Closing, then, so long as the non-breaching Party
does not incur any costs of liabilities on account of such breach (and, if the
non-breaching Party is Purchaser, no Asset suffers a diminution in value on
account of such breach), such breach shall be considered not to have occurred
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) No notification by a Party of any breach pursuant to this **Section 7.3**
shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants of the Parties or
the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.

 



 

(e) There shall be no breach of the covenants in this **Section 7.3** as a
result of a Partys failure to report a breach of any representation or
warranty or a breach of an obligation to perform or observe any covenant or
agreement of which it had Actual Knowledge if the Party subject to the breach
or failure also had knowledge thereof prior to Closing.

 



 

 **Section 7.4.** **_Letters in Lieu; Assignments; Operatorship._**

 



 

(a) Sellers will execute on the Closing Date letters in lieu of division
and/or transfer orders relating to the Assets, on forms prepared by Sellers
and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, to reflect the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Sellers will prepare and execute, and Purchaser will execute, on the
Closing Date, the Conveyances and any additional assignments necessary to
convey to Purchaser all federal and state Leases and Surface Rights in the
form as prescribed by the applicable Governmental Body and otherwise
acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in **Article 5 **and the special warranty of title
contained in the Conveyances, Sellers make no representations or warranties to
Purchaser, express, implied or by statute, as to transferability or
assignability of operatorship of any Seller Operated Assets. Rights and
obligations associated with operatorship of any such Seller Operated Assets
may be governed by operating and similar agreements that control the
appointment of a successor operator, and in such case, whether Purchaser will
succeed as operator of the subject Seller

 



 

42

      
 

 



 

Operated Assets (or portions thereof) will be determined in accordance with
the terms of such agreements. However, Sellers will assist Purchaser in
Purchasers efforts to succeed Sellers or Sellers Affiliate(s) as operator of
any Oil and Gas Properties included in the Assets, including designating
and/or appointing by assignment, to the extent legally possible, Purchaser as
successor operator or taking any other actions permitted or required under the
applicable operating agreement or other governing document (including
executing letters whereby the applicable Seller resigns as operator of all
Seller Operated Assets). Purchaser shall, promptly following Closing, to the
extent required by Law, file all appropriate forms, declarations or bonds with
the applicable federal and/or state agencies relative to its assumption of
operatorship with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties. For all Seller
Operated Assets, Sellers and Purchaser shall execute appropriate change or
transfer of operator forms on the Closing Date, and the applicable Seller
shall thereafter promptly file said forms with the applicable Governmental
Body transferring operatorship of such Assets to Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 7.5.** **_Public Announcements._**

 



 

Until the Closing, no Party shall make or issue, or cause or permit any agent
or Affiliate to make or issue, any press release or other public announcement
regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures by any Party which are required by applicable securities or other
Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over
the disclosing Party or its Affiliates. At or after Closing, any Party shall
be permitted to issue press releases or other public announcements concerning
the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that the content of any such press
release or public announcement shall be subject to the prior review and
reasonable approval of the other Parties (which shall not be unreasonably
denied); and _provided further, however_ , that the foregoing shall not
restrict disclosures by any Party which are required by applicable securities
or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates.

reasonably anticipated to require capital expenditures by Purchaser as owner
of the Assets in

 



 

43

operation, or series of related operations, in respect of the Assets in excess
of $100,000 (net to Sellers or its Affiliates interest), (vi) shall not
terminate (other than by failing to renew an existing term), amend or waive
any material right under any Contract or Lease, extend the terms of any
Contracts or enter into any contracts or agreements that if entered into prior

attached to this Agreement, (vii) shall maintain insurance coverage on the

Governmental Body, or make or change any election with respect to Taxes,
relating to the Assets, or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any claim or assessment with respect to Taxes
relating to the Assets, (xii) shall not (A) settle or compromise any claim
relating to the Assets for which Purchaser would have liability or (B) settle
or compromise any claim relating to the Assets against a third party that
would compromise or waive any claim in excess of $100,000, and (xiii) will
not commit to do any of the items described in **Section 7.6(a)(v)**,
**Section 7.6(a)(vi)**, **Section 7.6(a)(x)**, **Section 7.6(a)(xi)** and
**Section 7.6(a)(xii)** above. In the event of an emergency, Sellers may take
such action as a prudent operator would take without the prior written consent
of Purchaser; _provided, however_ , that Sellers shall notify Purchaser of
such action promptly thereafter.

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers may own an undivided interest in
certain of the Assets, and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the
other working interest owners who are not a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller
shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this **Section 7.6**
nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute
such a violation so long as each Seller (and any Affiliate of Sellers) has
voted its interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
**Section 7.6**.

 



 

 **Section 7.7.** **_Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements._**

 



 

(a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are expressly subject to
all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements. Within 10 Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement, Sellers shall initiate all procedures which are reasonably required
to comply with or obtain the waiver of all Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements set forth in **_Schedule 5.13_** with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all applicable consents and to obtain waivers of
applicable Preference Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall not be
obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any out of pocket cost or
expense for the benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer
Requirement in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith; and
provided further that, except as provided in **Section 7.7(c)**, any Transfer
Requirement that states that consent thereto cannot

 



 

44

      
 

 



 

unreasonably be withheld (or words to similar effect), and as to which the
lessor, or other holder of such Transfer Requirement, has not objected to the
transfer or affirmatively stated that consent thereto will not be forthcoming,
shall be deemed waived and otherwise satisfied 15 days after Sellers make
written request to said lessor, or other holder of such Transfer Requirement,
for consent to transfer the affected Asset(s) to Purchaser.

 



 

(b) If the holder of a Preference Right elects prior to Closing to purchase
the Asset subject to a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") in
accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and Sellers receives
written notice of such election prior to the Closing, such Preference Property
will be eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of the Preference Property.

 



 

(c) If

 



 

(i) a third party brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to the
Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce a
Preference Right;

 



 

(ii) an Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that (A) provides that the
transfer of such Asset without compliance with such Transfer Requirement will,
or that pursuant to applicable Law will, result in termination or other
material impairment of any rights in relation to such Asset or the value
thereof, (B) that is held by a Governmental Body, (C) provides that any
assignment of the Asset affected thereby is, or that pursuant to applicable
Law is, void or voidable or (D) is expressly denied by the holder thereof, and
(in each case) such Transfer Requirement is not waived by the holder thereof
or obtained prior to the Closing Date; or

 



 

(iii) the holder of a Preference Right does not elect to purchase such
Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the
time in which the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired;

 



 

then, unless otherwise agreed by Sellers and Purchaser, the Asset or portion
thereof affected by such Preference Right or Transfer Requirement (a "Retained
Asset") shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and conveyed to
Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Retained Asset pursuant to **Section
7.7(b)**. Any Retained Asset so held back at the initial Closing will be
conveyed to Purchaser (subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in
**Section 8.2** with respect to such Retained Asset) at a delayed Closing
(which shall become the new Closing Date with respect to such Retained Asset),
within 10 Business Days following the date on which the suit, action or other
proceeding, if any, referenced in clause (i) above is settled or a judgment is
rendered (and no longer subject to appeal) permitting transfer of the Retained
Asset to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and Sellers obtain a waiver of
or notice of election not to exercise from the applicable third parties, or
otherwise satisfy, all remaining Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements
with respect to such Retained Asset as contemplated by this **Section
7.7(c)** (or if

 



 

45

      
 

 



 

multiple Assets are Retained Assets, on a date mutually agreed to by the
Parties in order to consolidate, to the extent reasonably possible, the number
of Closings). At the delayed Closing, Purchaser shall pay Sellers a purchase
price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced on account
of the holding back of such Retained Asset (as adjusted pursuant to **Section
2.2** through the new Closing Date therefor with respect to such Retained
Asset); _provided_ , _however_ , if all such Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the initial
Closing are not obtained or waived by the holder thereof as contemplated by
this Section within 120 days after the initial Closing has occurred with
respect to any Asset, then such Retained Asset shall be eliminated from the
Assets and shall become an Excluded Asset, unless Sellers and Purchaser agree
to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset, in which case Purchaser
shall be deemed to have waived any objection (and shall be obligated to
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons for all Losses) with respect to non-
compliance with such Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect
to such Retained Asset(s).

 



 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers desire to sell all of the Assets to
Purchaser and would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchasers
agreement to purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is
expressly understood and agreed that Sellers do not desire to sell any
Property affected by a Preference Right to Purchaser unless the sale of all of
the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (other than the Retained Assets or other Assets excluded
pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement). In furtherance of the
foregoing, Sellers obligation hereunder to sell the Preference Properties to
Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the Closing Date
of the sale of all of the Assets (other than Retained Assets or other Assets
excluded pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement) in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement; provided that, nothing herein is intended or
shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to any portion of the
Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of the essence with
respect to the Parties agreement to consummate the sale of the Assets by the
Closing Date (or by any delayed Closing Date pursuant to **Section 7.7(c)**).

 



 

 **Section 7.8.** **_Tax Matters._**

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of **Section 12.3**, Sellers shall be
responsible for all Taxes related to the Assets (including ad valorem,
property, severance, Hydrocarbon production and similar Taxes based upon or
measured by the ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of
Hydrocarbons therefrom) attributable to any period of time prior to the
Effective Time, and Purchaser shall be responsible for all such Taxes related
to the Assets attributable to any period of time on and after the Effective
Time (the "Prorated Taxes"). For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall be
responsible for all Taxes related to the Excluded Assets. In the case of any
Taxes upon or measured by the volume or dollar amount of Hydrocarbon
production, Sellers and Purchaser shall each be allocated and responsible for
all such Taxes attributable to the production allocated to each under
**Section 1.4**; in the case of any Taxes based on net or gross income, each
party shall be allocated and be responsible for its own taxable income; and in
the case of any other Taxes, Sellers and Purchaser shall each be allocated and
responsible for such other Taxes due with respect to a taxable period
beginning prior to the Effective Time and ending on or after the Effective
Time, based upon the number

 



 

46

      
 

 



 

of days in such period prior to the Effective Time (in the case of Sellers) or
after the Effective Time (in the case of Purchaser). To the extent there is a
conflict between the allocation provisions of this **Section 7.8(a)** and
**Section 1.4**, this **Section 7.8(a)** shall control. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body
of all Taxes with respect to the Assets which are required to be paid prior to
Closing (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes). Sellers
(in consultation with Purchaser) shall also handle payment to the appropriate
Governmental Body of all Texas ad valorem and property Taxes based on units of
Hydrocarbons produced prior to the Closing Date and for which payment is due
after the Closing Date. If requested by Purchaser, Sellers will assist
Purchaser with preparation of all ad valorem and property Tax Returns for
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including any extensions
requested), but which are required to be paid after the Closing Date. Sellers
shall deliver to Purchaser within 30 days of filing copies of all Tax Returns
to be filed by Sellers relating to the Assets and any supporting documentation
to be provided by Sellers to Governmental Bodies for Purchasers approval,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, excluding Tax Returns related to
income tax, franchise tax, or other similar Taxes. Purchaser shall file all
Tax Returns covering Taxes treated as Property Costs that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date unless covered above. With respect to such Tax
Returns covering a taxable period which includes the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to Sellers within 30 days prior to
filing for Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If any
Taxes allocated to Sellers pursuant to this **Section 7.8** or **Section
1.4** are actually paid by Purchaser, then, after the Closing Date and upon
written request by Purchaser, Sellers shall, within 15 Business Days of such
request, make a payment to Purchaser of the amount of any such Taxes paid by
Purchaser but allocated to Sellers. If any Taxes allocated to Purchaser
pursuant to this **Section 7.8** or **Section 1.4** are actually paid by
Sellers and not already accounted for in an adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to **Section 2.2(d)**, then, after the Closing Date and upon written
request by Sellers, Purchaser shall, within 15 Business Days of such request,
make a payment to Sellers of the amount of any such Taxes paid by Sellers but
allocated to Purchaser.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Purchaser and each Seller agree (i) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Body, and (ii)
to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, each Party shall allow the other Party the option of taking
possession of such books and records prior to their disposal. Purchaser and
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby. Sellers shall promptly notify

 



 

47

      
 

 



 

Purchaser in writing upon receipt by any Seller of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the income, properties or
operations of Seller that reasonably may be expected to relate to or give rise
to a lien on the Assets. Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall promptly notify
the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audit or assessment challenging the Allocated Values or the Tax Allocation.

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge that reporting. compliance and payment obligations
and procedures that apply to state unclaimed property and escheat obligations
("Unclaimed Property Matters" ) differ significantly from those for income
taxes, severance taxes and other types of Taxes, and that some of Sellers are
currently under examination with respect to unclaimed property and escheat
obligations. Accordingly, notwithstanding other provisions to the contrary in
this **Section 7.8**, **Section 1.4** and elsewhere in this Agreement, this
**Section 7.8(c)** shall govern the obligations of the parties (as among
themselves) with respect to Unclaimed Property Matters, which obligations
shall not be prorated or treated as Property Costs. Since the Purchaser is
assuming pre-Effective Time liabilities expected to be paid from the Suspended
Funds (the "Suspended Funds Liabilities") and Sellers are retaining any other
pre-Effective Time liabilities arising from the Assets or from any Sellers
other operations, as between the parties the Purchaser shall be responsible
for the reporting, compliance and payments required for Unclaimed Property
Matters with respect to the Suspended Fund Liabilities, while the Sellers
shall be responsible for the reporting, compliance and payments required for
Unpaid Property Matters with respect to other liabilities incurred prior to
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be responsible
for Unclaimed Property Matters related to liabilities incurred in the
operation of the Assets after the Effective Time. Purchaser and Sellers shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
in connection with such Unclaimed Property Matters with respect to liabilities
incurred prior to the Effective Time. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Unclaimed Property
Matters and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Purchaser and each Seller agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to such Unclaimed Property Matters pertinent to
liabilities incurred prior to the Effective Time during the pendency of any
examination of until all obligations with respect to such Unclaimed Property
Matters have ceased, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Governmental Body with respect to such books and records, and
(ii) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, each Party shall allow the other Party the option of taking
possession of such books and records prior to their disposal. Each of
Purchaser and Sellers shall promptly notify the other in writing reasonably
promptly after the commencement of examination or other proceedings by a
Government Authority or its agents with respect to Unclaimed Property Matters
(other than such examinations or proceedings disclosed prior to the Effective
Time).

 



 

(d) Sellers and Purchaser hereby agree that Sellers shall have the right at
any time prior to completion of all the transactions that are to occur at
Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary (as that term is defined in Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) in order to accomplish the
transaction in a manner that will comply, either in whole or in part, with the
requirements of a

 



 

48

   

   

 



 

like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code (an "Exchange").
Likewise, Purchaser shall have the right at any time prior to completion of
all the transactions that are to occur at Closing to assign all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in an Exchange for the same
purpose. If Sellers assign all or any of their rights under this Agreement for
this purpose, Purchaser agrees to (i) consent to Sellers assignment of their
rights in this Agreement, which assignment shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, and (ii) pay the Closing Payment (or a designated
portion thereof as specified by Purchaser) and direct the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Deposit into a qualified escrow or qualified trust account(s) at
Closing as directed in writing. If Purchaser assigns all or any of its rights
under this Agreement for this purpose, Sellers agree to (A) consent to
Purchasers assignment of its rights in this Agreement, which assignment shall
be in a form reasonably acceptable to Sellers, (B) accept the Purchase Price
from a Qualified Intermediary, the qualified escrow or qualified trust account
at Closing (as applicable), and (C) at Closing, convey and assign directly to
Purchaser or a Qualified Intermediary (as applicable) the Assets (or any
portion thereof) as directed by Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that (v) any Exchange shall not release any Party from any of its
respective liabilities and obligations hereunder, (w) neither Party represents
to the other Party that any particular Tax treatment will be given to any
Party as a result thereof, (x) the Closing shall not be delayed or affected by
reason of any Exchange, nor shall consummation or accomplishment of an
Exchange be a condition precedent or condition subsequent to the exchanging
Partys obligations under this Agreement, and the exchanging Partys failure
or inability to consummate an Exchange for any reason, or for no reason at
all, shall not be deemed to excuse or release the exchanging Party from its
obligations under this Agreement, (y) no Party shall be required to take an
assignment of this Agreement for the relinquished or replacement property or
be required to acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of
consummating an Exchange desired by the other Party, and (z) the exchanging
Party shall pay any additional costs that would not otherwise have been
incurred by the non-exchanging Party had the exchanging Party not consummated
the transaction through an Exchange and the exchanging Party shall indemnify
the non-exchanging Party against any such additional costs or liabilities. The
Party electing to assign all or any of its rights under this Agreement
pursuant to this Section shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other
Party and its Affiliates from all claims relating to or arising from such
election.

 



 

(e) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to **Article 11** shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by Purchaser and Sellers on their Tax Returns to the extent
permitted by Law.

 



 

 **Section 7.9.** **_Further Assurances._**

 



 

After the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates, as applicable to, execute, acknowledge and deliver from time to
time all such further conveyances, transfer orders, division orders, notices
and such other instruments, and shall take such further actions as any Party
may reasonably request and as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish
the transactions described in this Agreement (including that all of the Assets
intended to be conveyed under the terms of this Agreement are so conveyed,
including such Assets that are improperly described herein or inadvertently
omitted from this Agreement and/or

 



      
 

 



 

the Conveyances and/or the Exhibits attached to each of the foregoing and to
perfect Purchasers title thereto.

 



 

 **Section 7.10.** **_Notice of Claims._**

 



 

Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable (but
in any event within five Business Days) of any written notice received or
given by any Seller or Affiliate of any Seller with respect to (a) any alleged
material breach of any Lease or Contract, (b) any action to alter, terminate,
rescind or procure a judicial reformation of any Lease or Contract or (c) any
new claim for damages or any new investigation, suit, action or litigation
with respect to the Assets.

 



 

 **Section 7.11.** **_Enforcement of Third Party Warranties, Guarantees and
Indemnities._**

 



 

Sellers agree that as of the Closing Date, to the extent relating to the
Assumed Seller Obligations and at Purchasers request, Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, for the benefit of Purchaser and
at Purchasers cost and expense, all of Sellers (or their respective
Affiliates) rights against un-Affiliated third parties under any warranties,
guarantees or indemnities given by such third parties with respect to the
Assets.

 



 

 **Section 7.12.** **_Non-Compete._**

 



 

From the Closing Date until 12 months thereafter, no Seller shall, and each
Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, acquire in
any capacity, or assist any Person to acquire, any interest in any oil, gas
and mineral lease, oil and gas lease, mineral fee interest, fee interest or
other mineral interest or contract to acquire any of the foregoing, in each
case relating to lands located in (a) Brazos County, Texas, (b) Burleson
County, Texas or (c) Robertson County, Texas; provided, that the foregoing
restriction shall not apply to (i) the acquisition of any equity interests in
a Person unless the aggregate value of the assets of such acquired Person
within the foregoing counties comprise more than 25% of the total assets of
such Person) or (ii) any Excluded Assets, Assets which Sellers retain as a
result of the title or environmental defect procedures set forth in this
Agreement, or Offered Leases not acquired by Purchaser in accordance with
**Section 1.2(c)**.

 



 

 **Section 7.13.** **_Transferred_** ** _Employees_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with **Article ** **10** ,
Sellers and their Affiliates shall make available to Purchaser each of the
Field Employees to discuss post-Closing employment with Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser. Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate may, in its sole
discretion, make offers of employment to any of the Field Employees, which
offers shall be on such terms and conditions as Purchaser may determine. With
respect to each Field Employee who accepts an offer of employment from
Purchaser or its Affiliate as contemplated by this **Section 7.1** **3** and
commences such employment (each, a "Transferred Employee"), Sellers and their
Affiliates shall (A) terminate the employment of such Transferred Employee as
of the time immediately prior to the Closing and (B) waive and release, from
and after the Closing, any confidentiality, non-competition, non-disclosure
and similar agreements between Sellers or

 



      
 

 



 

any Affiliate of Sellers and such Transferred Employee that would prevent such
Transferred Employee from commencing employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliate or hinder such Transferred Employee from performing his/her duties
for Purchaser or its Affiliate, or that relate to the businesses conducted by
Sellers or their Affiliates. Purchaser will not assume or otherwise be
responsible for any accrued vacation and paid time off for any Transferred
Employees that accrued through the Closing Date or any other obligation or
liability whatsoever arising under or relating to any Seller Benefit Plan, or
from employment with or termination of employment by Sellers or their
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this **Section 7.1** **3** are for the sole benefit of
the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Field Employee or other current or former employee of Sellers or
any of their Affiliates, other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns) any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including with respect to the matters provided for in this **Section 7.1**
**3** ) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
**Section 7.1** **3** amends, or will be deemed to amend (or prevent the
amendment or termination of) any Seller Benefit Plan. Sellers and Purchaser
shall provide each other with such data and other information as may be
reasonably required to carry out the intent of this **Section 7.1** **3**.

 **Section 9.4.** **_Closing Adjustments._**

 



 

(a) Not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare in good faith and deliver to Purchaser, based upon the best
information available to Sellers at such time, a draft preliminary settlement
statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") estimating each Sellers
share of the Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all adjustments
listed in **Section 2.2** and any amounts to be escrowed pursuant to
**Section 3.4(k) **and reflecting the calculation of the adjustments used to
determine such amounts. Within three Business Days of receipt of the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Purchaser will deliver to Sellers a written
report containing all changes, with the explanation therefor, that Purchaser
proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by Sellers and Purchaser, will be used to
adjust the Adjusted Purchase Price and determine the dollar amount to be paid
by Purchaser to each Seller at the Closing (each, the "Closing Payment"). If
Sellers and Purchaser cannot agree on the Preliminary Settlement Statement
prior to Closing, the Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented by Sellers
(with such changes agreed to by the Parties) will be used to adjust the
Adjusted Purchase Price and determine each Closing Payment.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than 120
days following the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser a statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") setting forth the
final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price, and each Sellers share
thereof, and showing the calculation of each adjustment, based on actual
credits, charges, receipts and other items before and after the Effective Time
and taking into account all adjustments provided for in this Agreement,
including any amount escrowed pursuant to **Section 3.4(k)** (the "Final
Purchase Price"). Sellers shall, at Purchasers request, supply reasonable
documentation in Sellers or their Affiliates possession available to support
any credit, charge, receipt or other item for which adjustments are made.
Sellers shall afford Purchaser and its representatives the opportunity to
review such statement and the supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers, and
other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and
appropriate in Purchasers review of such statement. Each Party shall
cooperate fully and promptly with the other and their respective
representatives in such examination with respect to all reasonable requests
related thereto. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the 30th
day following receipt of Sellers statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver
to Sellers a written report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be
made to such statement.

 



 

(c) Sellers and Purchaser shall undertake to agree on the Final Settlement
Statement, including the final statement of the Final Purchase Price, and each
Sellers share thereof, no later than 180 days after the Closing Date (the
"Final Settlement Date"). In the event that Sellers and Purchaser cannot reach
agreement by the Final Settlement Date, either Party may refer the remaining
matters in dispute to a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm as
may be mutually selected by Purchaser and Sellers (and absent such mutual
selection, as appointed by the Houston office of the American Arbitration
Association), for review and final determination (the "Agreed Accounting
Firm"). Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
shall summarize its position with regard to the remaining matters in dispute
in a written document of 25 pages or less and submit such summaries to the
Agreed Accounting Firm, together with any other documentation such Party may
desire to submit.

 



      
 

 



 

Within 15 Business Days after receiving the Parties respective submissions,
the Agreed Accounting Firm shall render in writing a decision choosing
Sellers position or Purchasers position, whichever is most accurate based on
the terms of this Agreement and the materials described above. The Agreed
Accounting Firm may not award damages or penalties to any Party. Any decision
rendered by the Agreed Accounting Firm pursuant hereto shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Sellers and Purchaser and will be enforceable
against any of the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees of
the Agreed Accounting Firm shall be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and
one-half by Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case. Within 10 Business Days after the
date on which Sellers and Purchaser or the Agreed Accounting Firm, as
applicable, finally determines the disputed matters, subject to **Section
3.4(k) **with respect to any amounts escrowed pursuant thereto (i) Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers each Sellers share of the amount by which the Final
Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment or (ii) each Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount by which such Sellers share of the Closing Payment
exceeds such Sellers share of the Final Purchase Price, as applicable.

 



 

(d) All payments made or to be made hereunder to a Seller shall be by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such
Seller as set forth on **_Schedule 9.4(d)_,** for the credit of Sellers or to
such other bank and account as may be specified by such Seller to Purchaser in
writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank and account
specified by Purchaser in writing to Sellers.

(c) by Purchaser, if any of the conditions set forth in **Section** ** 8.2**
(other than the conditions set forth in **Section** ** 8.2(f)**) have not

condition set forth in **Section** ** 8.2(f)** has not been waived or
satisfied on or before the Termination Date;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) by Sellers or Purchaser, if there shall be any Law that makes consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or a
Governmental Body shall have issued an order, decree, or ruling or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, decree,
ruling, or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

case, (i) if the breaching Party is Purchaser, Sellers shall be entitled to
receive the Deposit as their exclusive remedy and as liquidated damages for
Purchasers breach, in accordance with **Section 2.4**, and (ii) if the
breaching Party is Sellers (or any Seller), Purchaser shall be entitled to be

diligence investigation of the Assets, in each case, in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, and an officer of Purchaser shall certify same to
Sellers in writing.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to **Section 10.1**, Seller
Representative and Purchaser agree to execute Joint Instructions to distribute

WAIVERS**

 



 

 **Section 11.1.** **_Receipts._**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Hydrocarbons produced from

Subject to the indemnification by Sellers under **Section 11.5 **and
Purchasers rights under (a) any title indemnity agreement entered into by the
Parties pursuant to this Agreement and (b) the special warranty of title
contained in the Conveyances, from and after the Closing Purchaser shall
assume and hereby agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to
be fulfilled, performed, paid or discharged) (i) all of the following
obligations and liabilities of each Seller, known or unknown, with respect to
the Assets, regardless of whether such obligations or liabilities arose prior

to furnish makeup gas according to the terms of applicable gas sales,
gathering or transportation contracts, and to satisfy all other gas balancing
obligations, if any, (B) the obligation to pay the

 



      
 

 



 

holders of working interests, royalties, overriding royalties and other
interests the Suspended Funds to which they are entitled (it being agreed
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
the provisions of **Section 12.20** below, Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for the distribution of all Suspended Funds transferred or
credited to Purchaser pursuant hereto, and that Purchasers obligations

Liabilities, and (G) the obligation to perform all obligations applicable to
or imposed on the lessee, owner, or operator under the Leases and related
joint operating agreements, or as required by applicable Laws or applicable
Contracts. All of such duties, obligations, responsibilities, and liabilities
to be assumed by Purchaser with respect to the Oil and Gas Assets and
Midstream Assets shall be referred to herein as the "Assumed Oil and Gas
Obligations" and the "Assumed Midstream Obligations," respectively
(collectively, the "Assumed Seller Obligations"). Notwithstanding the terms of
**Section 11.3** to the contrary, the Assumed Seller Obligations shall not
include, and Purchaser shall have no obligation to assume, any obligations or
liabilities to the extent that they are (such excluded obligations and
liabilities, the "Excluded Seller Obligations"):

 



 

(A) attributable to, or arise out of, the ownership, use or operation of the
Excluded Assets;

 



 

(B) the continuing responsibility of Sellers under **Section 11.1** or
**Section 11.2**;

 



 

(C) Property Costs for which any Seller is responsible pursuant to **Section

 **Section 11.4.** **_Survival and Limitations; Exclusive Remedy._**

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties contained in **Article 5 **and
**Article 6** (other than the Fundamental Representations and the Tax
Representations) shall terminate 12 months after Closing (the "Survival
Date"). The representations and warranties contained in **Section 5.2**,
**Section 5.3**, **Section 5.4, Section 5.6, Section 6.1, Section 6.2,
Section 6.3,** and **Section 6.5**(collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations") shall survive the Closing without time limit, and the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in **Section 5.8 **and
**Section 5.** **19** shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the
applicable Tax statute of limitations period plus 30 days (collectively, the
"Tax Representations"). Upon the termination of a representation or warranty
in accordance with the foregoing, such representation or warranty shall have
no further force or effect for any purpose under this Agreement; provided

 



      
 

 



 

that, subject to **Section 11.4(b)**, there shall be no termination of any
bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation or warranty prior to its expiration date. The covenants and
other agreements of each Seller set forth in **Section 7.6** shall survive
the Closing Date and delivery and recordation of the Conveyances hereunder
until the Survival Date. All other covenants and other agreements of each
Seller and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
without time limit. The indemnities in **Section 11.5(a)** and **Section
11.6(a)** shall terminate as of the termination date of each respective
representation or warranty that is subject to indemnification. Subject to
**Section 11.4(b)**, there shall be no termination of a bona fide claim
asserted pursuant to the indemnities prior to the date of termination for such
indemnity.

 



 

(b) No Party shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to this
**Article 11** or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement unless it shall have received from the Party seeking
indemnification a written notice (a "Claim Notice") of the existence of the
claim for or in respect of which indemnification in respect of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is being sought. A Claim
Notice in respect of a representation or warranty must be delivered on or
before the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in **Section
11.4(a)**. If an Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice in respect of a
representation or warranty to an Indemnifying Party before the expiration of
the applicable survival period set forth in **Section 11.4(a)**, then the
applicable representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for
purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such Claim Notice. A
Claim Notice shall set forth with reasonable specificity (i) the basis for
such claim under this Agreement, and the facts that otherwise form the basis
of such claim and (ii) to the extent reasonably estimable, an estimate of the
amount of such claim (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such claim) and an explanation of the calculation of such estimate.
Without limitation of the foregoing, Sellers agree and acknowledge that
Purchaser shall, prior to Closing, be entitled to deliver a Claim Notice if
one or more of the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in
**Article 5** is not true and correct as of the Closing Date (such a claim, a
"Pre-Closing Indemnity Claim").

 



 

(c) No Party shall have any liability for any indemnification under **Section
11.5(a)** and/or **Section 11.6(a)** of this Agreement, as applicable (except
for breaches of Fundamental Representations and Tax Representations), until
and unless (i) the amount of the Loss for any individual claim or series of
claims arising out of the same or similar set of facts, for which a Claim
Notice is delivered by Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, and for which the
Indemnifying Party is liable, exceeds $100,000 ("Individual Indemnity
Threshold"), and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Losses for all claims for
which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, and
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under this Agreement after
application of the provisions of clause (i) above, exceeds 1.25% of the
Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such damages exceed 1.25% of the
Purchase Price (the "Aggregate Indemnity Deductible"); provided that:

 



 

(A) Sellers indemnities in **Section 11.5(a) **(with respect to the
Fundamental Representations and Tax Representations) and any other provision
of **Section 11.5** shall not be limited by this **Section 11.4(c)**;

 



      
 

 



 

(B) Purchasers indemnities in **Section 11.6(a) **(with respect to the
Fundamental Representations only) and any other provision of **Section 11.6**
shall not be limited by this **Section 11.4(c)**; and

 



 

(C) Sellers indemnities in **Section 11.5(a)** which relate to a Pre-
Closing Indemnity Claim shall not be limited by this **Section 11.4(c)**.

 



 

In addition, Sellers indemnities in **Section 11.5(c) **(with respect to
Production Payments only) shall be subject to the Individual Indemnity
Threshold, but shall not be subject to the Aggregate Indemnity Deductible. For
the avoidance of doubt, claims for which Claim Notices are delivered by
Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, which do not meet the Individual
Indemnity Threshold shall not be included in reaching the Aggregate Indemnity
Deductible. For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
of Sellers representations and warranties for which Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification under **Section 11.5(a)** and the Losses resulting from any
such breach, any dollar or materiality qualifiers in Sellers representations
and warranties shall be disregarded.

 



 

(d) Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Sellers shall
not be required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to **Section 11.5(a)**
(except with respect to breaches of Fundamental Representations and Tax
Representations) for aggregate Losses in excess of 20% of the Purchase Price.
Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to **Section 11.5(a)** for aggregate
Losses attributable to breaches of Fundamental Representations in excess of
100% of the Purchase Price.

 



 

(e) Absent fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to
the Assets and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the
express provisions of this Agreement (including pursuant to this **Section
11.4(e)**) and any agreement delivered between the Parties at Closing
(including any title indemnity agreement entered into by the Parties pursuant
to this Agreement and the Conveyances). Without limitation of the foregoing,
absent fraud and except with respect to (i) Purchasers rights with respect to
the special warranty of title contained in the Conveyances and (ii) any claims
or Losses attributable to any breach by Purchaser or Sellers (as applicable)
of any of the provisions of **Section 1.5**, **Section 3.7(b)**, **Section
7.5**, **Section 7.7**, **Section 7.8**, **Section 7.9**, **Section
7.11**, **Section 9.4**, **Section 11.1** and **Section 11.2 **(each, a
"Specified Covenant"), if the Closing occurs, the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parties for any and all (A) claims relating to any representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements that are contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered at Closing, (B) other claims pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement and (C) other claims relating to the Assets and
the purchase and sale thereof, shall be any right to indemnification from such
claims that is expressly provided in this Agreement and any other agreement
delivered between the Parties at Closing and, and if no such right of
indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims are hereby waived to
the fullest extent permitted by Law. In the event of any breach by a Party of
any of the provisions of any Specified Covenant, the non-breaching Party(ies),
in addition to any rights of indemnification set forth herein or in any
agreement delivered between the Parties at Closing, shall have all rights at
Law or in equity with respect to or on account of such breach, including the
right to seek specific

 



      
 

 



 

performance and injunctive relief (without the necessity of posting any bond
in connection therewith).

 



 

 **Section 11.5.** **_Indemnification by Each Seller._**

 



 

Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this **Article 11**,
from and after the Closing, Sellers are responsible for, shall pay on a
current basis and hereby jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, members, agents, consultants, advisors and other
representatives (including legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors)
and the successors and permitted assigns of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Persons"), from and against any and
all Losses asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon, or incurred or
suffered by any Purchaser Indemnified Person, directly or indirectly, to the
extent resulting from, arising out of or relating to:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of a Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of a Seller in
connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or

furnished by or on behalf of a Seller in connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the Retained Liabilities; and

 



 

(d) the Excluded Seller Obligations, **REGARDLESS OF FAULT**.

 



 

 **Section 11.6.** **_Indemnification by Purchaser._**

 



 

From and after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
**Article 11 **and Sellers indemnity obligations under **Section 11.5**,
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller, its
Affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees, agents,
consultants, advisors and other representatives (including legal counsel,
accountants and financial advisors) and the successors and permitted assigns
of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons"),
from and against any and all Losses, asserted against, resulting from, imposed
upon, or incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person, directly or
indirectly, to the extent resulting from, arising out of, or relating to:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser to
Sellers in connection with this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any certificate
furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser to Sellers in connection with this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) the Assumed Seller Obligations, **REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ; and

 



      
 

 



 

(d) the indemnity obligations set forth in **Section 4.4**;

 



 

but excepting, in each case, Losses with respect to which Sellers are required
to indemnify Purchaser and the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to
**Section 11.5 **or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement or any document or
agreement executed in connection herewith.

 



 

 **Section 11.7.** **_Indemnification Proceedings._**

 



 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which Sellers or Purchaser (in
each case, as applicable, an "Indemnifying Party") may be liable to a
Purchaser Indemnified Person under **Section 11.5** or to a Seller
Indemnified Person under **Section 11.6** (as applicable, an "Indemnified
Party") is asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified
Party by an un-Affiliated third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party has Actual
Knowledge of the Third Party Claim notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third
Party Claim by delivery of a Claim Notice and a copy of all papers (if any)
served with respect to such Third Party Claim, provided that, the failure or
delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this **Article 11**, except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party demonstrates (to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Indemnified Party) that (i) it had insufficient time available to permit such
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or (ii)
its defense of such Third Party Claim is otherwise materially prejudiced by
such failure or delay. In the case of a claim for indemnification based on a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from receipt of
the Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party (in this **Section 11.7**, the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense,
to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand; _provided_ ,
that the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice
Period, and at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall reasonably deem necessary to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) Subject to **Section 11.7(d)**, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (at its sole cost and
expense) only if and for so long as the Indemnifying Party (i) notifies the
Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party is
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) uses counsel of its own
choosing that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and (iii)
conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim in an active and diligent
manner. If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the defense
of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in
contesting any such Third Party Claim to the extent such cooperation is so
requested by the Indemnifying Party, and, further, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to
participate in the defense thereof; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable attorneys fees
of the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised
the Indemnified Party that there is a conflict of interest that could make it
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have
common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party it being
understood and agreed, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
responsible for paying for more than one separate firm

 



      
 

 



 

of attorneys and one local counsel to represent all of the Indemnified Parties
subject to such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects (and is entitled) to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement thereof or consent
to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party
Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid
in full by the Indemnifying Party (and no injunctive or other equitable relief
is imposed upon the Indemnified Party) and there is an unconditional provision
whereby each plaintiff or claimant in such Third Party Claim releases the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement thereof effected without its written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (or fails to give
notice to the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period, otherwise is not
entitled to assume such defense or fails to diligently prosecute or settle the
Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its own choice, at the
expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Party; _provided, however_ ,
that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of any
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (except with respect to the matters on
**_Schedule 5.7(a)_** for which Sellers have indemnified Purchaser) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control the defense of (but shall
be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over the defense,
settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment of any Third Party Claim
if (i) the Indemnified Person has been advised by counsel that an actual
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) the Third
Party Claim, individually or in the aggregate with any other claim, involves
potential Losses that exceed the amount of the indemnification available under
this Agreement, (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive relief or is part
of a criminal proceeding or (iv) the Third Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Persons
business or relates to its customers, suppliers, vendors or other service
providers; _provided, however_ , in the event that the Indemnifying Party is
not entitled to assume exclusive control of the defense, then the Indemnifying
Party shall not be bound by any determination resulting from any compromise or
settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(e) Subject to **Section 11.4(b)**, in any case in which an Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification hereunder and no Third Party Claim is involved, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party
within a reasonably prompt period of time after an officer of such Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates has obtained actual knowledge of the Loss giving rise
to indemnification hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
**Section 11.4(b)**, the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
**Article 11** except to the extent such failure

 



      
 

 



 

results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party
to effectively mitigate the resulting Losses or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnifying Party. In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Losses complained of, (ii) admit
its obligation to indemnify for and bear all expenses associated with such
Losses or (iii) dispute the claim for such Losses. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it has
cured the subject Losses or that it disputes the claim for such Losses, the
amount of such Losses shall conclusively be deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 **Section 11.10.** **_Recording._**

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall record the
Conveyances in the appropriate counties where the Oil and Gas Properties and
the Surface Rights are located and provide each Seller with copies of all
recorded or approved instruments.The Conveyances

 



      
 

 



 

in the form attached as **_Exhibit B-1_** and **_Exhibit B-2_** are intended
to convey all of the Oil and Gas Properties and Surface Rights being conveyed
pursuant to this Agreement. Certain Oil and Gas Properties and Surface Rights
or specific portions of the Oil and Gas Properties and Surface Rights that are
leased from, or require the approval to transfer by, a Governmental Body are
conveyed under the Conveyances and also are described and covered under
separate assignments made by Sellers to Purchaser on officially approved
forms, in sufficient multiple originals to satisfy applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements. The interests conveyed by such separate assignments
are the same, and not in addition to, the interests conveyed in the
Conveyances attached as **_Exhibit B-1_** and **_Exhibit B-2_**. Further,
such assignments shall be deemed to contain all of the exceptions,
reservations, rights, titles, power and privileges set forth herein and in the
Conveyances as fully and only to the extent as though they were set forth in
each such separate assignment.

 



 

 **Section 11.11.** **_Certain Indemnification Amounts for Matters on
Schedule 5.7(a)._**

 



 

In the event of a settlement or determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction, tribunal, arbitration or mediation of any of the matters set
forth on **Schedule 5.7(a)** that causes Purchaser (as Sellers successor in
interest) to not have Defensible Title with respect to any Unit, Well or other
Asset as set forth in **_Exhibit A-1_**, then Purchasers Losses for
diminution in value of such Unit, Well or other Asset shall be determined by
application of the provisions of **Section 3.4(g)** and **Section 3.4(h)**
as the sole method of calculating Purchasers Losses for such diminution in
value; provided, that (a) if in connection with not having Defensible Title
with respect to such Unit, Well or other Asset, Purchaser is entitled to
receive a cash payment from a third party in connection with such third
partys acquisition of a working interest in a Well or Lease, then to the
extent Purchaser actually receives such amount or recovers such amount by
setting off against amounts due and payable from Purchaser to such third
party, the amount of Purchasers Losses shall be so reduced, and (b) such
calculation of Losses shall not be limited by the Individual Title Threshold
or the Aggregate Defect Deductible. For purposes of clarity and by way of
example, if it is determined that a third party owns a working interest in a
currently producing Well and such determination results in Purchaser (as
Sellers successor in interest) having a lesser Net Revenue Interest in such
Well than set forth in **_Exhibit A-1_**, then the amount of Purchasers
Losses for diminution in value with respect to such Well would be determined
in accordance with **Section 3.4(g)** and **Section 3.4(h)**, but would be
reduced by the amount, if any, of such third partys pro rata portion of
drilling, completion and other operation costs attributable to such Well that
(i) such third party pays to Purchaser in order to participate as a working
interest owner in such Well or (ii) Purchaser actually recovers by setting off
against amounts otherwise payable from Purchaser to such third party.
