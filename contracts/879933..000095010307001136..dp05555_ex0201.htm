the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition 
Proposal and (B) enter into, participate and maintain discussions or 
negotiations with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the Person making

Agreement pursuant to Section  9.01(d)(i) to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior  Proposal if the Board of Directors

fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided,  however_ , that the Board
may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or  terminate the Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(i) unless (a) the Company  notifies Parent, in
writing and at least five Business Days prior to such  Adverse Recommendation
Change or termination (the " **Notice  Period** "), promptly of its intention
to effect an Adverse Recommendation  Change or terminate this Agreement and
to enter into a binding written agreement  concerning a Superior Proposal,
attaching the most current version of all  relevant proposed transaction
agreements and other material documents (and  a  description of all material
terms and conditions thereof (including the identity  of the party making
such Superior Proposal)), (b) the Company causes its  financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with  Parent  in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such  adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such  Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (c) Parent  does not make,
within five Business Days of receipt of such written  notification, an offer
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines  in  good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28

Proposal,  the  Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to

respect to such  new  written notice (to the extent so required), except
that the Notice Period  shall  be reduced to three Business Days.

Company from  taking  and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9  and  14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act or
Section 99 of the Securities Act  (Ontario) with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal _provided_ , any  disclosure made pursuant to this Section 5.03(e)
(other than a "stop, look and  listen" letter or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule  14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act) shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation  Change unless the Board of Directors of the
Company expressly states in such  disclosure that its recommendation in favor
of the approval of the Arrangement  Resolution has not changed.

 

 

(f) As  used in this Agreement, the term:

 

 

(i) " **Superior  Proposal** " means a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal, which was not  obtained in violation of this Section 5.03, and that
the Board of Directors  of  the Company in good faith determines, would, if
consummated, result in a  transaction that is more favorable from a financial
point of view to the  Shareholders (in their capacity as Shareholders) than
the transactions  contemplated hereby (x) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisor,  (y)  after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction  on  the terms set forth therein (as
compared to the terms herein) and (z) after  taking into account all
appropriate legal (with the advice of outside counsel),  financial (including
the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory  or  other aspects of
such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted by  Applicable Law;
_provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the
references to "25% or more" in the definition of  Acquisition Proposal shall

standstill restriction, in  which  case the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be deemed to be amended to contain  only  such less restrictive provision,
or to omit such provision, as  applicable).

contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or
indirectly,  the right to control or direct the Company's or its

the right to control or direct  Parent's or its Subsidiaries' operations.

(a) From  and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company to,  indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable  Law (and to also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted  under Applicable Law), each present and former
director and officer of the  Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
**Indemnified Person** ")  against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with  any  claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified  Person's
service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or 
services performed by such Persons at the request of the Company or its 
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed 
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the approval of this 
Agreement, the Arrangement or the other transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated hereby. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
settle,  compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any claim,
action,  suit,  proceeding or investigation or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding  or  investigation without the consent of an Indemnified
Person (such consent  not to  be unreasonably withheld) (i) unless such
settlement, compromise or consent  includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Person (which release  shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified  Person) from all liability arising out of
such action, suit, proceeding,  investigation or claim or (ii) that includes
an admission of fault of such  Indemnified Person.

 

 

(b) Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to,  Parent shall cause the Company as of the Effective Time, to
obtain and fully  pay  the premium for the extension of (i) the directors'
and officers' liability  coverage of the Company's existing directors' and
officers' insurance policies  and (ii) the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each  case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six  years

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  

 

 

 

 

 


 

from  and  after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period  or time  at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same  or  better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to  directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance  (collectively, " **D andO Insurance**") with
terms, conditions,  retentions and limits of liability that are no less
advantageous than the  coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies with respect to any  actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission,  neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer  of  the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in  such  capacity that existed
or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including  in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated  hereby). If the
Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Company shall continue to  maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the  Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms,  conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are no less advantageous  than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date  hereof, or the
Company shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such  six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability  that  are at
least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of  the
date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Company  be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual 
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by 
the  Company for such insurance; and _provided, further_ , that if the
annual  premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company
shall  obtain  a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such  amount.

 

 

(c) If  the Company or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
amalgamate,  consolidate with or merge or wind-up into any other Person and
shall not  be the  continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii)
transfer all or  substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in  each  such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns  of  the Company shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section  6.03.

 

 

(d) This  Section 6.03 shall survive the consummation of the Arrangement and
is intended  to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Persons  and their respective heirs and personal representatives
and shall be binding  on  the Company and its successors and assigns. If any
Indemnified Person  makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses under this  Section 6.03 that is denied by the Company or Parent,
and a court of competent  jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person
is entitled to such  indemnification, then the Company or Parent shall pay
such Indemnified Person's  costs and expenses, including reasonable legal
fees and expenses, incurred  in  connection with pursuing such claim against
the Company or Parent.

 

 

(e) The  rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 6.03 shall be
in addition  to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the
articles of  incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under  any  Applicable Law or under any agreement or
contract of any Indemnified Person  with  the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All rights to indemnification  and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior  to  the Effective Time and
rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto  now  existing in favor
of any Indemnified Person as provided in the certificate  of  incorporation
or bylaws of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company  or  any
indemnification contract or agreement between such

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Indemnified  Person and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive
the Effective  Time and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner  that  would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified  Person.

Canadian Competition Act or any other applicable Competition Law,  each  of
Parent and the Company shall use its best efforts to resolve such
objections,  suit, action or proceeding so as to allow the Effective Time to

foregoing, in  exercising its best efforts, and in exercising its best
efforts to obtain  Investment Canada Act Approval, Parent shall, and shall

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32

the  fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

transactions  contemplated hereby), to terminate any existing relationships
and contractual  rights and obligations and to enter into licensing

shall use its reasonable best efforts to enable the provision  of 
reasonable access without violating such Applicable Law) or confidentiality 
obligations (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts 
to  obtain waivers to such obligations or implement requisite procedures to

notifies the other  party in writing on or prior to February 1, 2008 of its
election to extend  the  End Date to April 20, 2008; _provided_ , _further_
, that the right  to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section

(iii) the  Arrangement Resolution shall have failed to receive the requisite
vote for  approval at the Company Meeting (including any adjournment or

being satisfied by the End  Date;  _provided_ that neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub is then in breach of  this Agreement so as to cause any of
the conditions set forth in Section  8.01 or  Section 8.03 not to be
satisfied; or

of being satisfied by  the  End Date; _provided_ that the Company is not
then in breach of this  Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set

Section  10.03. _Survival of Representations and  Warranties_ _. _The 
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or 
other  writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective 
Time. This Section 10.03 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of  the
parties that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective  Time.

 

 

Section  10.04. _Amendments and Waivers_ _;  Reorganization_ _._   (a)
Subject to the provisions of the Interim Order and Applicable Law, any 
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived at any time and from 
time  to time prior to the Effective Time (whether before or after the
holding  of the  Company Meeting) pursuant to a writing signed by each party
(in the case  of an  amendment) or by each party against whom the waiver is
to be effective (in  the  case of a waiver), without further notice to or
authorization on the part  of the  Shareholders, and any such amendment or
waiver may, without limitation: (i)  change the time for performance of any
of the obligations or acts of the  parties; (ii) waive any inaccuracies or
modify any representation contained  herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto; (iii) waive compliance  with  or modify any of the
covenants herein contained and waive or modify performance  of any of the
obligations of the parties; and (iv) waive compliance with  or  modify any
conditions precedent herein contained.

 

 

(b) No  failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege  hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single
or partial  exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise  of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies  herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies  provided by Applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Prior  to the date of the Company Meeting, Parent may propose actions or
transactions  to the extent that the same (i) shall not prejudice the
Shareholders, (ii)  are  either to be completed immediately prior to or
contemporaneously with the  Effective Time, or can be unwound without
adversely affecting the Company  and  its Subsidiaries, (iii) would not be
reasonably expected to materially impair  or  delay the ability of Parent or
Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iv) would not cause any representation  or  warranty in this
Agreement to be breached or any condition to Closing set  forth  in Article
8 to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this  Agreement or
any material agreement to which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is a
party. The Company

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 


 

shall  take  such actions or undertake such transactions and, if necessary,
the Plan of  Arrangement shall be modified accordingly. If, at the request of
the  Parent, the Company effects any transaction before the Effective Time
for  such  purposes, the Parent will be responsible for any structuring and
unwinding  costs  if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not  consummated.

 

 

Section  10.05. _Expenses_ _._   (a) Except as otherwise provided herein,
all costs and expenses  incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring  such cost or expense.

 

 

(b) If  a Payment Event occurs, the Company shall pay as directed by Parent
in writing  (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the Termination
Fee in  accordance with the last sentence of this Section 10.05(b) less the
amount  of  any Parent Expenses previously paid by the Company to Parent and
any applicable  withholdings. As used herein, " **Termination Fee** " means
an amount equal to 3.0% of the aggregate Consideration. As used  herein, "
**Payment Event** " means the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to (x)
Section 9.01(c)(i), Section 9.01(c)(iii) or Section 9.01(d)(i)  or (y)
Section 9.01(b)(i) or Section 9.01(b)(iii) but only if, in the case  of 
this clause (y), (A) prior to such termination, a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal  shall have been made or announced by a Third Party, and (B)
pursuant to a  definitive agreement executed within twelve months following
the date of  such  termination (regardless of whether the transactions
contemplated by such  agreement are consummated within twelve months
following the date of such  termination): (1) the Company is acquired,
directly or indirectly, by  arrangement or otherwise by, any Third Party; (2)
any Third Party, directly  or  indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the
total assets of the Company and  its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (3)
any Third Party, directly or indirectly,  acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Shares or voting Securities  of  any of the Company's
Subsidiaries whose net revenue, net income or assets,  individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 50% or more of the Consolidated  net  revenue, net
income or assets, as applicable, of the Company. If a  Payment Event occurs
due to a termination of this Agreement (i) by the Company  pursuant to
Section 9.01(d)(i), the Termination Fee shall be payable  simultaneously with
the occurrence of such Payment Event and (ii) for any  other  reason, the
Termination Fee shall be payable within two Business Days following  such
Payment Event.

 

 

(c) In  the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Acquisition
Sub,  on one  hand, or the Company, on the other hand, pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(iii)  (or could have been terminated under such section) under
circumstances in  which  the Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to
Section 10.05(b), then  the Company shall pay as directed by Parent in
writing as promptly as possible  (but in any event within two Business Days)
following receipt of an invoice  therefor all of Parent's and Acquisition
Sub's actual and reasonably documented  out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses)  actually incurred by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates  on  or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount shall not be greater  than
$10,000,000 (" **Parent Expenses** "); _provided_ that  the existence of
circumstances which could require the Termination Fee  subsequently to become
payable pursuant to Section 10.05(b) shall not  relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant  to  this Section 10.05(c);
and _provided, further_ that the payment by  the Company of Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 10.05(c) shall not  relieve the Company of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any  subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to  Section
10.05(b) except to the extent indicated in such  Section 10.05(b).

 

 

(d) The  Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
10.04(b)  are  an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that,  without these agreements, Parent and Acquisition Sub
would not enter into  this  Agreement. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree
that, upon any  termination of this Agreement under circumstances where
Acquisition Sub is  entitled to the Termination Fee and such Termination Fee
is paid in full,  Parent  and Acquisition Sub shall be precluded from any
other remedy against the  Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and
neither Parent nor Acquisition  Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment, or damages of any kind,  including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, against the Company  or  any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors,  officers, employees, partners,
managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates  in  connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

Section  10.06. _Disclosure Schedule  References_ _. _  The parties hereto
agree that any reference in a particular Section of the  Company Disclosure
Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or,  as  applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties  (or
covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in  the 
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations 
and  warranties of such party that are contained in this Agreement, but only
if  the  relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes  of)  such representations and warranties is reasonably apparent,
but shall not  be  deemed to constitute an admission, or otherwise imply,
that any matter so  referenced rises to the level of a Material Adverse
Effect or is otherwise  material for any purposes under this Agreement.

 

 

Section  10.07. _Binding Effect; Benefit;  Assignment_ _. _ (a) The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and,  except as provided
in Section 6.03, shall inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Except for the  rights to payments
pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement or as provided in  Section  6.03, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, 
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than 
the  parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

 

(b) Neither  this Agreement nor any rights or obligations under this
Agreement shall be  assignable by the parties without the prior written
consent of the other  parties, except that Parent and Acquisition Sub may
assign all or part of  their  respective rights or obligations, including
without limitation the rights  to  acquire the Company Shares, without
reducing their own obligations hereunder,  to  an Affiliate of Parent.
Subject thereto, this Agreement shall enure to the  benefit of and be binding
upon the parties and their respective successors  (including any successor by
reason of amalgamation of any party) and permitted  assigns.

 

 

Section  10.08. _Governing Law_ _. _This  Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws  of the  Province of Ontario and the
laws of Canada applicable therein.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section  10.09. _Jurisdiction; Service of  Process_ _. _(a)  The parties
hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce  any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection  with, 
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in 
any  court of the Province of Ontario, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably  consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate  courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably  waives,  to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or  hereafter have to the laying of the venue
of any such suit, action or proceeding  in any such court or that any such
suit, action or proceeding brought in  any  such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any  such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the  world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such  court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service  of process on such party as provided in Section 10.02
shall be deemed effective  service of process on such party.

 

 

(b) Each  of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby irrevocably designates Bennett
Jones  LLP  (in such capacity, the " **Process Agent** "), with an office at
3400  One First Canadian Place, Toronto, Ontario, M5X 1A4, Canada as its
designee,  appointee and agent to receive, for and on its behalf service of
process  in such  jurisdiction in any legal action or proceedings with
respect to this Agreement  or the transactions contemplated hereby, and such
service shall be deemed  complete upon delivery thereof to the Process Agent;
_provided_ that in  the case of any such service upon the Process Agent, the
party effecting  such  service shall also deliver a copy thereof to Parent
in the manner provided  in  Section 10.02. Each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall take all such  action as may be necessary to continue said
appointment in full force and  effect  or to appoint another agent so that
each of Parent and Acquisition Sub will  at  all times have an agent for
service of process for the above purposes in  the  Province of Ontario. In
the event of the transfer of all or  substantially all of the assets and
business of the Process Agent to any  other  entity by consolidation,
merger, sale of assets or otherwise, such other  entity  shall be
substituted hereunder for the Process Agent with the same effect  as if 
named herein in place of Bennett Jones LLP. Nothing herein shall  affect the
right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by  Applicable
Law. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly  acknowledges that the
foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under  all  Applicable Laws.

 

 

Section  10.10. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH  OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL  BY  JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT  OR THE  TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

Section  10.11. _Counterparts;  Effectiveness_ _. _This  Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts  and may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or email, and each counterpart  shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and  hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective  when  each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all  of the  other
parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a  counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall  have  no
effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether 
by  virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other  communication).

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section  10.12. _No Liability_ _. _No  director or officer of Parent or
Acquisition Sub shall have any personal  liability whatsoever to the Company
under this Agreement, or any other  document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby  on  behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub.
No director or officer of the  Company shall have any personal liability
whatsoever to Parent or Acquisition  Sub under this Agreement, or any other
document delivered in connection with  the  transactions contemplated hereby
on behalf of the Company.

 

 

Section  10.13. _Entire Agreement_ _. _This  Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement  between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement  and 
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, 
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  10.14. _Severability_ _. _If  any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by  a  court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Authority to be invalid,  void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants  and  restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and  shall  in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or  legal 
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any 
manner  materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the 
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect  the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable  manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated  as  originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

 

Section  10.15. _Specific Performance_ _. _Subject  to Section 10.05(d), the
parties acknowledge and agree that an award of money  damages would be
inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party  or its 
representatives and any such breach would cause the non-breaching party or 
a  third party beneficiary irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties  (on
behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement) 
agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement  by  one of the parties, the non-breaching party will also be
entitled, without  the  requirement of posting a bond or other security, to
equitable relief, including  injunctive relief and specific performance, and
the parties shall not object  to  the granting of injunctive or other
equitable relief on the basis that there  exists an adequate remedy at law.
Subject to Section 10.05(d), such  remedies will not be the exclusive
remedies for any breach of this Agreement  but  will be in addition to all
other remedies available at law or equity to each  of  the parties.

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be

the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate  which  immediately prior

exchanged for cash, together with a duly completed  and  executed Letter of
Transmittal and such additional documents  and  instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the Shareholder  of  such surrendered
certificate shall be entitled to receive in  exchange  therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Depositary to deliver to  such  Shareholder, a cheque (or
other form of immediately

available  funds) representing the cash which such Shareholder has the 
right to  receive under the Arrangement for such Company Shares, less  any
amounts  withheld pursuant to SECTION  4.03  and  any certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  The cash  deposited with the

earned on such funds shall be for  the account of  Acquisition Sub.

 

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

Until  surrendered as contemplated by this SECTION  4.01,  each certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time  represented  Company Shares
shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent  only  the right to
receive upon such surrender a cash payment in lieu  of such  certificate as
contemplated in this SECTION  4.01,  less any amounts withheld pursuant to
SECTION  4.03.  Any such certificate formerly representing Company Shares
not  duly  surrendered on or before the Sixth Anniversary shall cease to 
represent a  claim by or interest of any former Shareholder of any kind or 
nature  against or in the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub. On the 
Sixth  Anniversary, all cash to which such former holder was entitled  shall
be  deemed to have been surrendered to  Parent.

(c)

    |  

At  or before the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit with  the 
Depositary for the benefit of holders of Company Options, Company  Restricted
Shares, Company Performance Units, Company Deferred  Share Units  and
Company Deferred Share Equivalents, as applicable, the amount  of cash 
required to satisfy the payment obligations of the Company pursuant  to 
SECTION  2.03(b),  SECTION  2.03(c),  SECTION  2.03(d)  and  SECTION 
2.03(e),  such amount to be held for purposes of such obligations. The  cash
shall be  held in a separate interest-bearing account and any interest 
earned on  such funds shall be for the account of the Company. On or as 
soon as  practicable after the Effective Date, the Depositary shall deliver 
on  behalf of the Company to each holder who immediately before the 
Effective  Time was a holder of Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, 
Company  Performance Units, Company Deferred Share Units and/or Company 
Deferred  Share Equivalents, as reflected on the books and records of the 
Company, a  cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing  the  cash which such holder is entitled in accordance with
SECTION  2.03(b),  SECTION  2.03(c),  SECTION  2.03(d)  and/or SECTION 
2.03(e),  against receipt of such documentation as Parent or the Company 
may  reasonably require acknowledging the transfer and/or termination  of
the  Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance 
Units,  Company Deferred Share Units or Company Deferred Share Equivalents, 
as the  case may be, held by such holder.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(d)

    |  

Any  payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary on behalf of 
Acquisition  Sub or the Company that has not been deposited or has been
returned  to the  Depositary or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each
case,  on or before  the Sixth Anniversary, and any right or claim to
payment hereunder  that  remains outstanding on the Sixth Anniversary shall
cease to represent  a  right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of
the holder  to  receive the consideration for Company Shares, Company
Options,  Company

    |  

 

Restricted  Shares, Company Performance Units, Company Deferred Share  Units
or Company  Deferred Share Equivalents, as the case may be, pursuant  to
this Plan of  Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be surrendered 
and forfeited  to Acquisition Sub or the Company, as applicable, for no 
consideration.

 

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  4.02. _Lost  Certificates_.  In the  event any certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented  one or more outstanding
Company Shares that were exchanged pursuant to  SECTION  2.03  shall  have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of  that 
fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed,  the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed  certificate, cash deliverable in accordance with such holder's
Letter of  Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any
lost, stolen  or  destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to
be delivered  shall as  a condition precedent to the delivery of such cash,
give a bond satisfactory  to  Acquisition Sub and the Depositary in such sum
as Acquisition Sub may direct,  or  otherwise indemnify Acquisition Sub and
the Company in a manner satisfactory  to  Acquisition Sub and the Company,
against any claim that may be made against  Acquisition Sub and the Company
with respect to the certificate alleged  to have  been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 

 

SECTION  4.03. _Withholding  Rights_.  The  Company, Acquisition Sub,
Parent and the Depositary shall be entitled to  deduct  and withhold from
any consideration otherwise payable to any Shareholder  or  holder of
Company Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance  Units, 
Company Deferred Share Units and/or Company Deferred Share Equivalents 
such  amounts as the Company, Acquisition Sub, Parent or the Depositary

withheld  with  respect to such payment under the ITA, the United States
Internal Revenue  Code  of 1986, or any provision of federal, provincial,
territorial, state, local  or  foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To
the extent that amounts are  so  withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes hereof  as  having been paid to the Shareholder or
holder of Company Options, Company  Restricted Shares, Company Performance
Units, Company Deferred Share Units  and/or Company Deferred Share
Equivalents, as the case may be, in respect  of  which such deduction and
withholding was made, _provided_   that such  withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate taxing  authority.
