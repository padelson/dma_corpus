 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

This **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " **Agreement** ") is made and
entered into as of September 24, 2008, by and among Lineage Power Holdings,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **Parent** "), Birdie Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger
Sub** "), and Cherokee International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
" **Company** ").

  



  

 **BACKGROUND**

  



  

A. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders to consummate the merger (the " **Merger**
") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

B. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  



  

C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a
condition to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will enter into a voting
agreement (the " **Voting Agreement** ") with certain holders of Company
Common Stock (as defined herein) party thereto (collectively, the "
**Principal Stockholders** ") in the form of **_Exhibit A_** attached
hereto.

  



  

 **AGREEMENT**

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I** 
  **THE MERGER**

  



  

 **1.1** ** **_The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " **DGCL** "), Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation**
") and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of
the Company and of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

  



        
   

  



  

 **1.2** ** **_Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " **Closing**
") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., California time, on a date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third business day
after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing), at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California, or at
such other time, date or place agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " **Closing Date**."

  



  

 **1.3** ** **_Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, a certificate of
merger (the " **Certificate of Merger** ") shall be duly prepared, executed
and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent
time or date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is
referred to in this Agreement as the " **Effective Time**."

  



  

 **1.4** ** **_Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL and all other effects specified in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

 **1.5** ** **_Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

  



  

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " **Company Certificate** "), shall be
amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of **_Exhibit B_**, and, as
so amended, such Company Certificate shall be the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Subject to Section 6.6 of this Agreement, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

  



  

 **1.6** ** **_Directors_. At the Effective Time, each of the directors of
the Company shall resign from the Board of Directors of the Company. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue as the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

 **1.7** ** **_Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the
case may be.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE II** 
**EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  



  

 **2.1** ** **_Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (the " **Company Common Stock** ") or any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_.  Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or Parent or by any
subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and
no consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

  



  

(1) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and the Appraisal Shares),
including shares subject to restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to
time, performance or otherwise, shall be converted into the right to receive
$3.20 in cash, without interest (the " **Merger Consideration** ").

  



  

(2) At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
**Certificate** ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or
rights issued in respect of, the Company Common Stock, the
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, those shares (" **Appraisal Shares** ") of Company Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" **Section 262**") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c), but
rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262.

  



        
   

  



  

At the Effective Time and as allowed under applicable Law, the Appraisal
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair
value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the
Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

 **2.2** ** **_Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. The parties have selected Union Bank of California, N.A.
(the " **Paying Agent** ") as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Section
2.2, and in connection therewith, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement
with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.
 Immediately following the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall deposit,
or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying
Agent all the cash necessary to pay the Merger Consideration (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to, mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  

  



        
   

  



  

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment may be made to
a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.1. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon the
surrender of Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to
the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate who has
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with or otherwise pursuant
to any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions (including any undistributed Merger Consideration)
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Merger Sub or, if after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such banks
that are then publicly available) or in money market funds that are eligible
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

  



        
   

  



  

Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to the Surviving Corporation. If, for any reason (including losses), the cash
in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the
payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent
shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  



  

(i) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or
Merger Sub for any reason shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c).

  



         
 

  

 ** **

  

 **ARTICLE III** 
  **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  



  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except (A)
as identified in and reasonably apparent from the Company SEC Documents filed
by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2007 and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (the " **Filed Company SEC
Documents** ") and only as and to the extent disclosed therein (other than
any "risk factor" disclosure, forward looking discussions, or any other
disclosure that is predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature) and,
without giving effect to any change of fact or circumstance subsequent to the
date on which any such Filed Company SEC Document was filed, or (B) as set
forth in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company
to Parent and Merger Sub (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** ") (it being
understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of
such Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and
each other section or subsection of this Agreement only to the extent that
the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent):

  



  

 **3.1** ** **_Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (the " **Company Subsidiaries** ") is duly organized,
validly existing and, where such concept is applicable, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full
corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct
its businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the failure of which to
possess, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and,
where such concept is applicable, in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the nature of its business or their ownership or leasing of its properties
make such qualification or licensing necessary, except such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement true
and complete copies of the Company Certificate and the Bylaws of the Company,
as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " **Company
Bylaws** "), and the comparable charter and organizational documents of each
Company Subsidiary, in each case as amended through the date of this
Agreement.

  



  

 **3.2** ** **_Company Subsidiaries; Equity Interests_.

  



  

(a) _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company
Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interest in, each Company Subsidiary
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and, other than directors qualifying shares, are owned by the
Company, by one or more Company Subsidiaries or by the Company and another
Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " **Liens** ").

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any
person.

  



  

 **3.3** ** **_Capital Structure_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 60,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value

Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company that except as set forth in the letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, from Parent and Merger Sub to the Company (the " **Acquiror

 **4.1** ** **_Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power
and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, other than such franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals the failure of which to possess, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to (i)
impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) prevent or materially impede the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

 **4.2** ** **_Merger Sub_.

  



  

(a) Since the date of its incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any
business or conducted any operations other than the execution of this

thereto.

  



  

(b) All of the authorized and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is
owned by Parent.

  



  

 **4.3** ** **_Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement. The execution and delivery by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent, as
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will immediately after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement duly adopt this Agreement. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
(i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Laws, now or hereafter
in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) rules of law
governing specific performance and injunctive or other forms of equitable
relief.

  



        
   

  



  

 **4.4** ** **_No Conflicts; Consents_.

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement, do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the terms
hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries under,
any provision of (i) the charter or organizational documents of Parent or
Merger Sub, (ii) any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject
to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.4(b), any Judgment
or Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such
items that, individually or in the aggregate, do not and would not reasonably
be expected to (i) impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) prevent
or materially impede the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, notice to or
permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by
or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger,
other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, or any other
Antitrust Law of any foreign jurisdiction, (ii) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of

declarations, filings and notices that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Company a copy of Parents balance sheet dated as of July 25, 2008 ("
**Parent s Balance Sheet**"), which is attached in _Section 4.5_ of the

accordance with the books and records of Parent; (ii) is true and correct in
all material respects; and (iii) fairly and accurately presents in all
material respects the financial position of Parent as of the date thereof. As
of the date of Parents Balance Sheet, Parent was not liable for or obligated
with respect to any material debt (including the debt of any of Parents
affiliates) other than as reflected on Parents Balance Sheet.  Since the
date of Parents Balance Sheet through the date hereof, there has been no
material dimunition in the value of the assets of Parent nor has there been a
material increase in the outstanding debt of Parent.

  



  

 **4.6** ** **_Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
Companys stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

  



        
   

  



  

 **4.7** ** **_Brokers_. Except for The Gores Group, LLC, the fees
and expenses of which shall be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any
brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub.

  



  

 **4.8** ** **_Financing._ Parent and Merger Sub, at the Closing, will have

 **5.2** ** **_No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any director, officer or employee of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or

the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, cause, encourage or take any other action to facilitate
the submission of any Takeover Proposal or the making of any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (other than Parent or its
Representatives or the Companys Representatives) any confidential
information with respect to or intended to facilitate any Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.2, and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that failing to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives), provided that the Company receives or has received from
such party an executed confidentiality agreement with terms (including with
respect to standstill provisions) no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such
information has previously been provided to Merger Sub or is provided to
Merger Sub prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided to such person, (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding
such Takeover Proposal, and (z) waive any standstill with the person making
such Takeover Proposal.

  



        
   

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Takeover Proposal** " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group (other than Parent or
Merger Sub) relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct
or indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, including by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer,
exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture or similar transaction, of (A) assets or businesses that constitute
or represent 20% or more of the total revenue or assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that a European Takeover Proposal shall not constitute a Takeover Proposal
for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement or the
Merger or recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or
publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal (any
such action being referred to herein as an " **Adverse Recommendation
Change** "), unless, in the case of this clause (i), the Company Board
determines that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend or cause or
permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement related to
any Takeover Proposal (each, an " **Acquisition Agreement** ") constituting
or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.2(a)) or resolve or agree to take any such action, unless, in the
case of clause (ii), the Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failing to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2(b) to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in
response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
5.2(a), cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) of this Agreement and, following payment of the Termination
Fee, concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company Board shall not make
an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal and
the Company shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(f) until (y) the fifth calendar day following Parents receipt
of written notice (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ") from the Company
advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal,
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and stating that the
Company Board intends to exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (it being understood and agreed
that, prior to any such termination taking effect, any amendment to the price
or any other material term of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and a new five calendar day period) and (z) the
Company does not receive from Parent a definitive and binding offer to enter
into a definitive agreement which the Company Board determines, in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is
at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as the Superior
Proposal prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that, prior to effecting such
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith, to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate, to make such adjustments in terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal in
the judgment of the Company Board).

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Superior Proposal** " means
any written bona fide Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.2 and that, if consummated, would result in a person or group
(or in the case of a direct merger between such person or group and the
Company, the stockholders of such person or group) acquiring, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock or
the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) is more favorable from a financial point of view to
the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise)
that the Board determines in good faith to be relevant.

  



  

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly, and in any
event within three calendar days after receipt, advise Parent orally and in
writing of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably
believes is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the identity of
the person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry.  The Company shall,
subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, keep Parent reasonably
informed of the material details of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
The Company shall not take any action to exempt any person (other than Merger
Sub and Parent and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar
provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such
actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f).

  



        
   

  



  

(e) The Company shall (i) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information furnished after the date of this Agreement
in accordance with this Section 5.2 to any person or entity that
previously engaged in discussions with the Company or any of its
representatives or affiliates with respect to any transaction that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Takeover Proposal, and (ii) except as
set forth in Section 5.2(a)(ii)(z), shall not terminate, waive, amend or
modify any provisions of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
it or any Company Subsidiary is a party.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e 2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with applicable Law, it being understood, however, that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly and publicly reconfirms its Recommendation at
least two business days prior to the Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by
Section 5.2(b).

  



  

(g) Subject to compliance with Sections 5.1 and 6.12, notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 5.2, the parties agree that the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be authorized to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
cause, encourage or take any other action to knowingly facilitate the
submission of a takeover proposal solely with respect to the Companys
European operations (a " **European Takeover Proposal** ") or the making of
any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
European Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that, within three calendar
days after receipt of a European Takeover Proposal, it will advise Parent
orally and in writing of such European Takeover Proposal or any inquiry the
Company reasonably believes is reasonably likely to lead to a European
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
European Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making
any such European Takeover Proposal or inquiry.  The Company shall, subject
to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, keep Parent reasonably informed
of the material details of any such European Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

  



        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE VI** 
  **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  



  

 **6.1** ** **_Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form. The Company will provide Parent and its counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to
its filing and will incorporate reasonable comments of Parent and its
counsel. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto and
to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable,
and promptly thereafter shall mail the definitive Proxy Statement and form of
proxy to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall notify Parent promptly
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval
there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare, file with the SEC and mail to its stockholders
such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall not mail any
Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to which Parent
reasonably objects.

  



  

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " **Stockholders Meeting** ") for the purpose of seeking
the Stockholder Approval and, subject to Section 5.2(b) of this Agreement,
use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its stockholders in favor
of adoption of this Agreement and use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such other action as may be necessary to obtain the Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that
they give the Stockholder Approval and shall include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger as permitted by Section 5.2(b). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(c) The Company shall file all documents required, as determined by the
Company in consultation with its legal counsel, to be filed by the Company
with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, including
the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings (the " **Subsequent SEC Reports**
"). The Subsequent SEC Reports shall comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes Oxley

 **6.2** ** **_Access to Information; Confidentiality_. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to, afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees and
Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records, and to those employees of the
Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access, but only to the extent
that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws and (b) all

may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may
withhold (i) any document or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party, (ii) any document or
information to the extent that the disclosure thereof would result in the
loss of attorney-client privilege or (iii) such portions of documents or
information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if
the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as
determined by the Companys counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust
difficulties for the Company (or any of its affiliates). If any material is
withheld by the Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant to the proviso to
the preceding sentence, such party shall inform Parent as to the general
nature of what is being withheld. All information exchanged pursuant to this
Section 6.2 shall be subject to that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated
April 17, 2008, between Parent and the Company (the " **Confidentiality
Agreement** ").

  



  

 **6.3** ** **_Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
unless, to the extent permitted by Section 5.2(b), the Company Board approves
or recommends a Superior Proposal, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) using
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to cause the conditions
to Closing set forth in Article VII of this Agreement to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain a Consent or waiver from
any Governmental Entity that is required to be obtained to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) that are required to be made to satisfy the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(b) and (iii) the taking of all commercially reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from any third parties reasonably requested by Parent to be obtained
in connection with the Merger under the Material Contracts, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or the Company be
required to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any landlord or
other person to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall duly file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the " **FTC**
") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " **Antitrust
Division** ") the notification and report form (the " **HSR Filing**
") required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and as promptly as practicable.  The HSR Filing shall be
in compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with the other to the extent necessary to assist the
other in the preparation of its HSR Filing and to request early termination
of the waiting period required by the HSR Act.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from either Governmental Entity, (ii) not
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent
of the other parties thereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and (iii) not enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity
not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other. Parent and the Company shall, from the
date hereof until the Outside Date, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have lifted, vacated or terminated, any
injunction, decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay
the Closing (a " **Legal Impediment** ").

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Section 6.3, " **reasonable best efforts** " shall,
to the extent necessary to obtain the waiver or Consent from any Governmental
Entity required to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) or to
avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any
Legal Impediment, in each case prior to the Outside Date, require Parent or,
subject to clause (d) below, the Company to (i) propose, negotiate, offer
to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect),
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, and in connection with
the consummation of the Merger, the sale, divestiture or disposition of
assets or businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are not
part of the Companys business and/or assets or businesses of Parent or any
of its affiliates (or equity interests held by Parent or any of its
affiliates in entities with assets or businesses) that relate to the
Companys business or (ii) otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take
any action which it is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted, take
or commit to take such action, that limits its freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets or businesses of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries that are not part of the Companys business
and/or any assets or businesses of Parent or any of its affiliates (or equity
interests held by Parent or any of its affiliates in entities with assets or
businesses) that relate to the Companys business; provided, however, that
Parent shall in no event be obligated to take any action pursuant to the
foregoing if the taking of such action is reasonably likely to be materially
burdensome to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or to impact in a
materially adverse manner (x) the operations of Parent or (y) the economic or
business benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Section 6.3, " **reasonable best efforts** " shall
not require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend or to agree
to amend any Contract as a condition to obtaining any waiver or Consent,
except to the extent that any such amendment or agreement is requested by
the Parent and is expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In addition,  the Company
shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Parent to divest, hold separate
or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parents freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses or
assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, provided that any
such action shall be expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e) In addition, each of Parent and the Company shall, subject to applicable
Law and the limitations set forth in Section 6.2 and except as prohibited by
any applicable representative of any applicable Governmental Entity, (i)
promptly notify the other party of any written communication to that party
from any Governmental Entity and permit such other party to review in advance
any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing, (ii) not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat and
(iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between them and its affiliates and their respective Representatives on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members or their respective staffs
on the other hand, in each case with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.4** ** **_Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to provide that, at the Effective Time, each unexercised Company
Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested) shall be cancelled, with the holder of each such
Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to
(i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option. If the exercise price per share of any Company
Stock Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the cash amount
payable therefor shall be $0.01 per share.

  



         
 

  



  

(b) With respect to the ESPP, the Company shall not, following the expiration
of the current Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) (the "
**ESPP Termination Date** "), thereafter allow a new Offering Period
to commence, and the Company shall not amend the term of the current
Offering Period. Each participants accumulated payroll deductions, as of
the ESPP Termination Date, shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP, and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased thereunder shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c). The Company shall cause
the ESPP to terminate at the Effective Time, and no further purchase rights
shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

  



  

(c) Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.4(a) such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any tax Laws. If any such amounts are so withheld and remitted
to the appropriate taxing authorities in compliance with applicable tax Laws,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options pursuant to Section
6.4(a) in respect of such Company Stock Options.

  



  

 **6.5** ** **_Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (or, in each case,
until such person earlier ceases to be employed by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective subsidiaries), Parent shall either
(i) maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit
of the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " **Company Employees** ") the Company
Benefit Plans (other than any equity based compensation and change in control
benefits) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of this Agreement or
(ii) provide or cause to be provided benefits to each Company Employee that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate (not including any value
attributable to equity-based compensation or change in control benefits) to
the benefits provided to such Company Employee on the date of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular
Company Employee following the Closing Date, (ii) shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, or (iii) shall
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement following the Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such Company Benefit Plans or other compensation or
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements.

  



  

(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Company Employee
receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit
accrual) for service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any Company Subsidiary
provides such past service credit under its employee benefit plans) under
each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant subsidiary, as applicable,
in which such Company Employee becomes a participant; provided, however, that
no such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits.

  



        
   

  



  

As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or relevant subsidiary to, credit to Company Employees the amount
of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable
vacation plan or policy of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the
Closing Date. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant subsidiary for the
benefit of any Company Employees, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or relevant subsidiary
to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to
the extent any such periods, requirements or limitations would not have been
applicable under the applicable Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) cause each
Company Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by
such Company Employee under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the
plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant
subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt to the maximum extent
reasonably possible under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that Jeffrey Frank and Lin Fox
each have entered into an Amended and Restated Severance Agreement with the
Company, dated December 5, 2006 (as amended on February 29, 2008).

  



  

 **6.6** ** **_Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "
**Indemnified Persons** ") as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other agreements of the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiaries in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action,
at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall ensure that
the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations
and its obligations thereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the
Surviving Corporation then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section
6.6.

  



  

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance covering each person currently covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may substitute
therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors
and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this
Section 6.6(c);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated
to make premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 250% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company
for such insurance (such 250% amount, the " **Maximum Premium** "). If such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable
for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents
to Parent that the Maximum Premium is as set forth on _Section 6.6(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, however, if requested to do so by the Company, concurrent with the
Effective Time, satisfy their obligations under this Section 6.6(c) by using
commercially reasonable efforts to purchase an extended reporting period
"tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policy which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective
Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof,
and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including coverage amounts) which
are no less advantageous that those contained in the terms and conditions of
the Company directors and officers insurance policies in effect as of the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an amount in excess of $750,000 for
such extended reporting period "tail" policy.

  



        
   

  



  

 **6.7** ** **_Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the HSR Act
filing fee shall be borne by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Merger Consideration shall in no way be adjusted by or subject to the fees
and expenses of the parties.

  



  

(b) In the event that (i)(A) a Takeover Proposal has been made to the Company
or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally
(and not subsequently withdrawn) by any person (other than Parent or any of
its affiliates), (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(1) (but only if the
Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the date that is prior to the date
of such termination) or 8.1(b)(3) and (C) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters
into a definitive agreement providing for a Takeover Proposal (which is
subsequently consummated), or consummates, any Takeover Proposal (other than
with Parent or any of its affiliates) ( _provided_ , that solely for purposes
of this Section 6.7(b), the term " **Takeover Proposal** " shall have
the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in
Section 5.2(a) except that all references to 20% shall be deemed references
to 50%), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(c) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $2,500,000
(the " **Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent (x) in the case of a termination by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), within two business days after such termination,
(y) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
prior to or concurrently with such termination and (z) in the case of a
payment as a result of clause (i) of this Section 6.7(b), upon the first to
occur of the events set forth in Section 6.7(b)(i)(C). The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.7(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.8** ** **_Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any
Adverse Recommendation Change or other action taken by the Company or the
Company Board pursuant to Section 5.2(b), Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent practicable,
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by

that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and all communications material to employees of the

and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and Parent in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

 **6.10** ** **_Stockholder Litigation_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in the event that any stockholder litigation relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any members of
the Company Board prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or
any members of the Company Board relating to the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company
shall not give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or any members
of the Company Board relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent that it would require the Company to disclose
information subject to attorney-client privilege, unless and until Parent and
the Company shall have entered into a joint defense agreement with respect
thereto, reasonably acceptable to both parties. The Company agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such joint defense
agreement with Parent, if requested by Parent. The Company shall not agree
to any settlement of any stockholder litigation for an amount in excess of
$250,000 individually or $500,000 in the aggregate without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

representations of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 4.8 or serve as
a condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.12** ** **_Additional Company Actions_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
