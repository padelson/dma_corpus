of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except for shares held in the Companys treasury) shall be

Stock Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement:

holders of Company Common Stock and holders of Eligible Derivative Securities
as merger consideration pursuant to Article 1 hereof.

(ii) " _Company Fully Diluted Capitalization_ " means, as of a date and time
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (i) outstanding, (ii) outstanding upon conversion of the Company
Preferred Stock as described in Section 1.7(a) hereof; (iii) underlying all
outstanding Company Options; and (iv) underlying all outstanding Company
Warrants, other than any Assumed Company Warrants (the Company securities
described in clauses (iii) and (iv) are collectively referred to herein as "
_Eligible Derivative Securities_ ", and the holders of such Eligible
Derivative Securities are referred to herein as " _Eligible Derivative
Security Holders_ ").

Adjusted Merger Consideration, _divided_ by (ii) the Company Fully Diluted
Capitalization.

(iv) " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient of (x) the Per Share

(c) Eligible Derivative Securities.

(i) No later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, each Company
Option shall become vested and exercisable with respect to all of the shares
of Company Common Stock subject thereto. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall take such actions as are necessary or desirable to provide that each
Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time and upon the
cancellation thereof be converted into the right to receive, in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock then subject to such Company Option: a
fraction of a Merger Share equal to the product of (A) the applicable Option
Exchange Fraction _multiplied_ by (B) the Stock Exchange Ratio. The number of
Merger Shares issuable upon conversion of each Company Option pursuant to this

withheld and deducted by the Parent or the Exchange Agent as a result of the
conversion of such Company Option pursuant to Section 1.9(i) hereof.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Exchange Fraction_ " means,
with respect to a particular Company Option, the quotient of (x) an amount

elected to exercise its Company Warrant effective on or prior to the
Effective Time, then, unless otherwise prohibited by the express terms of such
Company Warrant, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by the holders
of such Company Warrants, each Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of
the Effective Time and upon the cancellation thereof be converted into the
right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock then
subject to such Company Warrant, a fraction of a Merger Share equal to the
product of (A) the applicable Warrant Exchange Fraction _multiplied_ by (B)
the Stock Exchange Ratio.

     | 1.8 | ADJUSTED MERGER CONSIDERATION; ESCROWED MERGER
CONSIDERATION; DISSENTING SHARES 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Adjusted Merger Consideration_. The maximum aggregate consideration
payable by Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger to holders of outstanding
Company Capital Stock and Eligible Derivative Securities (the " _Adjusted
Merger Consideration_ ") shall be an amount equal to (i) $220,000,000, _minus_
(ii) any Company Transaction Costs, if any, _minus_ (iii) any Excess
Indebtedness, if any, _minus_  (iv) any Prepayment Penalties, if any; _minus_
(v) any adjustments relating to Assumed Company Warrants as provided in
Section 1.8(f) below, if any; and _plus_ (vi) the Derivative Security Exercise
Amount.

 

(b) _Escrowed Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Article 1, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent that number of
Merger Shares equal to (i) $22,000,000 divided by (ii) the Closing Exchange
Price, and rounded to a whole number of shares on a holder-by-holder basis
(such amount, the " _Escrowed Merger Consideration_ ", and such Merger Shares
to be delivered to the Escrow Agent as Escrowed Merger Consideration, the "
_Escrowed Merger Shares_ "). The portion of the Escrowed Merger Shares
contributed on behalf of each Company Stockholder and Eligible Derivative
Security Holder shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of Merger
Shares to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to under Section 1.7.
The Escrowed Merger Shares shall be withheld from the Merger Shares
otherwise deliverable to the Company Stockholders and Eligible Derivative
Security Holders on the Closing Date. The Escrowed Merger Shares shall be
deposited with the Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") and
disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

(c) _Adjustments for Company Transaction Costs_. The Adjusted Merger
Consideration shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by that portion
of the fees and expenses incurred or accrued by the Company, including,
without limitation, any broker or  



      |  |

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 5  investment banking fees, in connection with the authorization, negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are not
paid by the Company at or prior to the Closing (the " _Company Transaction
Costs_ ").

(d) _Adjustments for Outstanding Indebtedness for Borrowed Money_. At least
five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to
Parent a certificate listing the amount of the Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Indebtedness_ ") signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
(such certificate, the " _Closing Indebtedness Certificate_ "). The Company
will afford the Parent timely access to all supporting work papers and any
other documentation of the Company used in the preparation of the Closing
Indebtedness Certificate. The Closing Indebtedness Certificate shall be based
on pay-off letters received from the holders of the Closing Indebtedness to
the extent such pay-off letters are available. If, and only if, the Closing
Indebtedness shown on the Closing Indebtedness Certificate exceeds the
Permitted Indebtedness Amount (such amount, if any, by which the Closing
Indebtedness exceeds the Permitted Indebtedness Amount being referred to
herein as the " _Excess Indebtedness_ "), the amount of any such Excess
Indebtedness shall be deducted from the Adjusted Merger Consideration on a
dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(iii) above. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Permitted Indebtedness Amount_ " shall equal the sum of
(A) $3,900,000, (B) the aggregate dollar amount of accounts receivable from
Parent to Company _provided, however_ , that the amount in clause (B) shall
not exceed $1,500,000, and (C) the Required Bonus Amount. Within 60 days of
Closing, the Parent may dispute in good faith any amounts reflected or
required to be reflected on the Closing Indebtedness Certificate by providing
written notice to the Company (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") specifying each
disputed item and the amount thereof in dispute, setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute and specifying the Parents calculation of
Excess Indebtedness. In the event of such a dispute, the Parent and
the Company shall attempt to reconcile their differences. If the Parent and
the Company are unable to resolve any such dispute within five (5) business
days of the Parents written notification to the Company of any such disputed
amounts pursuant to the Dispute Notice, the Company and the Parent shall
submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent
accounting firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to the Parent and
the Company (such accounting firm being referred to herein as the
"Independent Accounting Firm"). Such Independent Accounting Firm shall, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days
after such submission), deliver a report to the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative setting forth the Independent Accounting Firms calculation of
the disputed items, the Closing Indebtedness and the Excess Indebtedness. The
Independent Accounting Firms report and its resulting calculations of the
Closing Indebtedness and the Excess Indebtedness shall be final and binding
upon the Parent, the Company, the Company Stockholders, the Eligible
Derivative Security Holders and all parties to this Agreement for all purposes
of this Agreement. Upon the final determination of the Closing Indebtedness
and the Excess Indebtedness by the Independent Accounting Firm, the Adjusted
Merger Consideration shall be recalculated in accordance with Section 1.8
using the amounts of the Closing Indebtedness and the Excess Indebtedness as
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in lieu of the amounts of the
Closing Indebtedness and the Excess Indebtedness stated on the Closing
Indebtedness Certificate. If the Adjusted Merger Consideration as so adjusted
is lower than the Adjusted Merger Consideration as calculated based on the
amounts of the Closing Indebtedness and the Excess Indebtedness  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 6  stated on the Closing Indebtedness Certificate (such difference, if any, the
" _Excess Indebtedness Adjustment_ "), then the amount of such Excess
Indebtedness Adjustment, if any, shall be paid to the Parent by a claim
against the Escrow Fund without regard to the Company Deductible (an " _Excess
Indebtedness Claim_ "). If the Adjusted Merger Consideration as so adjusted
is higher than the Adjusted Merger Consideration as calculated based on the
amounts of the Closing Indebtedness and the Excess Indebtedness stated on the
Closing Indebtedness Certificate (such difference, if any, the "
_Indebtedness Reduction Adjustment_ "), then the amount of such Indebtedness
Reduction Adjustment, if any, shall be paid by the Parent to the Escrow Fund
in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock valued at the Closing Exchange
Price. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated equally between Parent and the Company.

(e)  _Adjustments for Prepayment Penalties_. The amount of any prepayment
penalties, if any, incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries as a result of
the Companys repayment of Indebtedness for Borrowed Money (collectively, "
_Prepayment Penalties_ ") between the date hereof and the Closing Date shall
not be deemed to be Closing Indebtedness for purposes of the Closing
Indebtedness Certificate but rather will be deducted from the Adjusted
Merger Consideration on a dollar-for-dollar basis pursuant to Section
1.8(a)(iv).

(f) _Adjustments for Assumed Company Warrants_. If any holder of a Company
Warrant does not exercise its Company Warrant in full effective on or prior to
the Effective Time, the Adjusted Merger Consideration will be reduced by an
amount equal to the fair market value of the portion of such Company Warrant
that will remain outstanding following the Effective Time (an " _Assumed
Company Warrant_ "). For purposes of the foregoing, the fair market value of
an Assumed Company Warrant shall be determined in accordance with US GAAP
consistent with the Parents past practices, and will be used by the Parent in
valuing an Assumed Company Warrant for purposes of calculating the total
purchase price of the Merger under US GAAP.

(g) _Adjustments Relating to the Derivative Security Exercise Amount_. The
Adjusted Merger Consideration will be increased by an amount (the "
_Derivative Security Exercise Amount_ ") equal to the product of (X) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to In the Money
Derivative Securities multiplied by (Y) the aggregate exercise price of all
In the Money Derivative Securities. For purposes of this Agreement, " _In the
Money Derivative Securities_ " shall mean all Company Options and Company
Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and immediately
following the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock as described in
Section 1.7(a) hereof) with an exercise price below the Per Share Merger
Consideration Value.

(h) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. Without limiting any other provision of
this Agreement, the Stock Exchange Ratio, Option Exchange Ratio and Warrant
Exchange Ratio shall each be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common
Stock), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Parent Common Stock occurring or having a record date
or an effective date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 7 (i) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Company
Stockholders who (i) shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and (ii) who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Merger Shares pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof.
Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive Merger
Shares pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 1.9 hereof, of the certificate
or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares. The Company shall give
the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by Company
or the Stockholder Representative, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by Company or the
Stockholder Representative; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Parent or as may be required under applicable Law, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

(j) _Parent Purchase Rights_. Pursuant to the Parents shareholder rights plan
adopted by the Parents board of directors on September 17, 2002, as effected
by the Rights Agreement, dated as of September 17, 2002, between the Parent
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent, each Company
Stockholder and each Eligible Derivative Security Holder shall also receive,
together with each Merger Share issued to him, her or it in the Merger
pursuant to this Article 1, an associated preferred share purchase right ("
_Parent Purchase Right_ ") pursuant to the Rights Agreement. References
herein to Merger Shares herein shall be deemed to include the associated
Parent Purchase Rights described in this Section 1.8(j).



     | 1.9 | SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. The transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock,
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or a bank or trust company designated
by the Parent prior to the Effective Time, shall act as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Section 1.9, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and Eligible Derivative Securities
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, an aggregate amount of
Merger Shares (other than Escrowed Merger Shares) sufficient to pay the
consideration for all issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock
and the Eligible Derivative Securities pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof,
together with any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.10 hereof (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). From and after the date that is
six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to the Parent any portion of the
Exchange Fund which had been made available to the Exchange Agent by or on
behalf of the Parent and which has not been disbursed  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 8  to holders of Company Capital Stock and the Eligible Derivative Securities,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Parent with
respect to such consideration payable upon due surrender of their
certificates for Company Capital Stock or evidence of their Eligible
Derivative Securities.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
later than five (5) business days after the Effective Time), the Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, as applicable, to each holder of record
of: (i) a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time evidenced outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock; or (ii) an
instrument which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced an
Eligible Derivative Security (such certificates and instruments collectively
referred to herein as the " _Instruments_ "), whose securities were converted
into the right to receive the number of Merger Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof, together with any cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.10 hereof: (A) a letter of
transmittal in the form attached as _Exhibit F-1 _ hereto (which specifies,
among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Instruments shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Instruments to the Exchange Agent) or in the case of any holder of
an Eligible Derivative Security, a letter agreement in the form attached as
_Exhibit F-2_ hereto (each such letter of transmittal and letter agreement
referred to herein as a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (B) instructions to
effect the surrender of the Instruments in exchange for the number of Merger
Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof,
together with any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.10 hereof. Upon surrender of an Instrument for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate Letter of Transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
a holder of such Instruments shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the number of Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 1.7 hereof, together with any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.10 hereof, and the Instruments so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Instrument
that, prior to the Effective Time, evidenced shares of Company Capital Stock
or an Eligible Derivative Security will be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment of
dividends or other distributions, to evidence the ownership of the number of
Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7
hereof, together with any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.10 hereof.

(d)  _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock declared or
made after the Effective Time and with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Instrument with respect to
the Merger Shares evidenced thereby until the holder of record of such
Instrument shall surrender such Instrument pursuant to Section 1.9(c) hereof.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Instrument, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the Instruments evidencing whole Merger
Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for Merger Shares is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Instrument surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 9  will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Instrument so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer pursuant to this Section 1.9(e), and that the Person
requesting such transfer will have paid to the Parent or any agent designated
by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for Merger Shares in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Instrument surrendered, or established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Parent or any agent designated by it that such Taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.9, none of the Exchange Agent, the Parent, Surviving Corporation, any other
Subsidiary of the Parent or any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock or an Eligible Derivative Security for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Securities_. From and after the
Effective Time, holders of Instruments shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, other than the right to receive the number of Merger Shares
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof and cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.10 hereof. The number
of Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7
hereof and cash in lieu of any fractional Merger Shares in accordance with
Section 1.10 hereof delivered upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Capital Stock and Eligible Derivative Securities in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock and Eligible
Derivative Securities, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital
Stock or Eligible Derivative Securities which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Instruments are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Section 1.9.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Instruments
evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative Securities
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Instruments, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such number of Merger Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof; provided,
however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Instruments to deliver an indemnity or bond (in such sum as it may reasonably
direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to the Instruments alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. The Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative
Securities such amounts as the Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (including, without
limitation, any withholding obligation with respect to the exercise of any
Eligible Derivative Securities). To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Parent or the  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 10  Exchange Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Capital Stock or Eligible Derivative Security, as applicable, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or the
Exchange Agent.



     | 1.10 | NO FRACTIONAL SHARES; MULTIPLE CERTIFICATES 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
certificates nor scrip for any fractional Merger Shares shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock or an Eligible Derivative Security otherwise entitled
to receive a fraction of a Merger Share pursuant to the provisions of Section
1.7 and 1.9 shall be paid in cash, in accordance with this Section 1.10, in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a Merger Share to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled, _multiplied_ by (ii) the Closing
Exchange Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends or interest on
or, except for the cash payment referred to in the preceding sentence, other
rights in respect of any such fractional interest. If more than one Instrument
shall be surrendered for the account of the same Company Stockholder or
Eligible Derivative Security Holder, the number of whole Merger Shares for
which such Instruments shall be exchanged pursuant to this Section 1.10 shall
be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Merger Shares for which
such Instruments are being exchanged.



     | 1.11 | ESCROW AGREEMENT 
---|---|--- 

At the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with U.S. Bank, N.A. or any
successor escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ ") appointed pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrowed Merger Consideration in the form of Escrowed Merger
Shares in the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 1.8(b) hereof. The
Escrowed Merger Shares shall be held in escrow in the Escrow Fund and applied
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



     | 1.12 | STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS 
---|---|--- 

At the close of business on the day prior to the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company
Capital Stock shall thereafter be made on such stock transfer books.



     | 1.13 | STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE 
---|---|--- 

(a) In the event that the Merger is approved by the Company Stockholders,
effective upon such vote, and without any further act by any Company
Stockholder, Scott Halsted is hereby appointed as the representative for and
on behalf of the Company Stockholders (other than stockholders, if any, as
shall have perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL) and the Eligible
Derivative Security Holders (the " _Stockholder Representative_ "), and shall
enter into the Escrow Agreement and take all actions required or permitted
under the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement with respect to the
interests and rights of the Stockholders with respect to the indemnity under
Article 9 hereof, and by executing this Agreement the Stockholder
Representative accepts such appointment. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholder Representative and the Stockholder Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services. Notices of communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative pursuant  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 11  to the notice requirements set forth in Section 12.3 of this Agreement shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Company Stockholders and
the Eligible Derivative Security Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholder Representative may deliver notice of communications to any Company
Stockholders or Eligible Derivative Security Holders via email to an address
specified by such Company Stockholders or Eligible Derivative Security
Holders. If the Stockholder Representative is no longer able or willing to
serve as the Stockholder Representative, a majority of the Company
Stockholders shall select a replacement Stockholder Representative.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted in such capacity while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company
Stockholders (other than stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected
their appraisal rights under the DGCL) and the Eligible Derivative Security
Holders shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative
and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
his duties, which may be paid from the Escrowed Merger Shares, if any, after
all claims by the Parent Indemnified Persons have been satisfied.

(c) Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Company Stockholders and
Eligible Derivative Security Holders for whom a portion of the Escrowed Merger
Shares otherwise issuable to them are deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
every Company Stockholder and Eligible Derivative Security Holder, and the
Escrow Agent, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of every such Company
Stockholder.

(d) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Company Stockholders and the
submission of a Letter of Transmittal by an Eligible Derivative Security
Holder shall constitute: (i) approval by such Persons of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and of all of the arrangements relating thereto; (ii)
approval of the appointment of the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; and (iii) the approval of such Persons of
the Stockholder Representative to perform all duties described in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement on their behalf.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 47  date of its delivery to the Company Stockholders. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of its Stockholder
to approve the Merger and this Agreement and each other transaction
contemplated hereby which requires such approval, and to enable the Closing to

Materials. The Company and the Parent shall mutually agree as to whether the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby by the Company Stockholders shall be sought by written consents or by
means of a duly called, convened and held meeting of the Company Stockholders
(the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). The Company shall, through its Board
of Directors, recommend to the Company Stockholders the approval and adoption
of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;

Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify such recommendation if (but
only if): (i) the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Company
Superior Proposal; and (ii) the Company has complied with the provisions of
Section 4.6, but any such withdrawal of recommendation shall not obviate the
obligation to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting. 



     | 4.4 | CERTAIN FILINGS 
---|---|--- 

(a) The Company shall cooperate with the Parent with respect to all filings
with Governmental Authorities that are required to be made by the Company to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
assist the Parent and the Merger Sub in making all such filings, applications

authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental Authority which may be
reasonably required or which the Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the HSR Act or to any
foreign or supranational antitrust, competition, merger control, foreign
investment or similar laws or regulations, the parties hereto shall promptly
and in good faith file or cause to be filed the appropriate notifications
with respect to the Merger and such transactions. Each party hereto shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from
any Governmental Authority for additional information or documentation. Each

in advance any proposed written communication to any Governmental Authority;

substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect

participate therein; and (C) with the exception of business documents deemed
confidential by the holder (including documents submitted as attachments to
each of the Parents Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act), each
party shall furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,

with any Governmental Authority or members of their respective staffs with

(a) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of: (i) the occurrence or non-

respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time, or (y) to
cause any covenant, condition or agreement of the Company in this Agreement
not to be complied with or satisfied in any material respect; and (ii) any

would be reasonably likely (x) to cause any representation or warranty of the

or (y) to cause any covenant, condition or agreement of the Parent or Merger

lead to a Company Takeover Proposal; or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding any Company Takeover Proposal (except

      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 49 (x) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
it is necessary to do so in order to act in a manner consistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, the Company
may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal which did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 4.6(a), which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor, is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, and which is made known to or received by the Company prior to the
obtaining of the approval of the Company Stockholders of this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant
to Section 4.3, and subject to providing prior written notice of its decision
to take such action to the Parent pursuant to paragraph (c) below, (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (as determined by the Company after consultation
with its outside counsel, the terms of which are no more favorable to such
person than the Confidentiality Agreement) and (B) participate in discussions
or negotiations regarding such Company Takeover Proposal (a " _Company
Takeover Response_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Company Takeover Response" shall not include the
following: (i) any Company response to an unsolicited Company Takeover
Proposal which does nothing more than provide to the party making such
unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal (an " _Interested Acquiror_ ") copies
of this Agreement and any of the Ancillary Agreements prior to the time that
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements are publicly filed as an
exhibit to the Parents SEC filings; (ii) if in response to a specific
request made by an Interested Acquiror, the Companys independent financial
advisor and/or its legal counsel engages in non-substantive discussions with
such Interested Acquiror for the sole purpose of clarifying the procedural
requirements set forth in this Agreement to be followed by such Interested
Acquiror, the Companys Board of Directors and the Company Stockholders in
order to consummate such Interested Acquirors Company Takeover Proposal;
provided, however, that upon such Interested Acquirors receipt of such
information requested by the Interested Acquiror, the Company shall not be
permitted to engage in any further communications with such Interested
Acquiror except to the extent permitted by this Section 4.6; or (iii) the
provision by the Company of financial information or other information
regarding the Company pursuant to a contractual obligation of the Company
existing as of the date hereof if, and only if, the party receiving such
information from the Company is a party to such contractual obligation and
such party is not a Person making a Company Takeover Proposal.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.6, neither the Company nor
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the approval or recommendation to the Company
Stockholders by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any
express or implied letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ ") related to any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the obtaining of the approval of the Company
Stockholders of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.3, the Board of Directors of the
Company, to the extent that it determines in good faith, after  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 50  consultation with its outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in
order to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable law, may (subject to this and the
following sentences) recommend any Company Superior Proposal, but only at a
time that is after the third business day following the Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company advising the Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company is prepared to recommend a Company Superior Proposal,
specifying the terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and
identifying the person making such Company Superior Proposal. During the
three (3) business day period following the Parents receipt of written notice
from the Company advising the Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company is prepared to recommend a Company Superior Proposal, the Parent may
make, and in such event the Company shall consider, subject to the fiduciary
duties of the Companys Board of Directors, a counterproposal to such Company
Superior Proposal.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.6, the Company shall advise the Parent in writing
as promptly as practicable (but in any event within twenty four hours) of (i)
any request for nonpublic information relating to any potential Company
Takeover Proposal or (ii) any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such request or Company Takeover Proposal and the identity
of the person making such request or Company Takeover Proposal. The Company
will keep the Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
Company Takeover Proposal.



     | 4.7 | EMPLOYEE MATTERS 
---|---|--- 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to adopt and/or continue all
Employee Benefit Plans of the Company identified in Section 2.18 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule as of the Closing Date; provided, however,
Surviving Corporation shall retain the sole discretion to amend, restate,
merge or terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan at any time after the
Closing; _further_ provided that if Parent elects to amend, restate, merge or
terminate any or all of such Employee Benefit Plans it shall, at a minimum,
continue to provide employees of Company who become employees of the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing Date benefits which, in the aggregate, are
equivalent to those provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent or
a combination of such benefits and those available under Companys Employee
Benefit Plans.

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and, except with respect to any
pension benefit plan or retiree medical plan, calculation of benefits (except
to the extent crediting such service would result in the duplication of
benefits) under each of Parents or Surviving Corporations employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements in which an employee of Company who is
employed as of the Closing Date and who becomes an employee of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Closing participates, Parent
shall grant, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to grant, each such
employee with credit for all service with Company to the extent permitted by
law.

(c) Concurrent with the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall make
payments to each employee for any bonus amounts that such employee may
be entitled to under the Companys Employee Incentive Bonus Program for
Fiscal Year 2006 as set forth in Section  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 51  4.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Required Bonus Amounts_ ")
it being understood that from and after the Effective Time, all employees
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Parents bonus policies.

(d) It is expressly agreed that the provisions of this Section 4.7 are not
intended to be for the benefit of or otherwise enforceable by any third
Person, including, without limitation, any employee of the Company, or any
collective bargaining unit or employee organization. Without limiting the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall create or imply any
obligation on the part of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide
any continuing employment right to any individual on or after the Effective
Time.

 



     | 4.8 | ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY 
---|---|--- 

Upon reasonable written notice, each party shall permit representatives of
the other to have access (at all reasonable times and in a manner so as not to
interfere with the normal business operations of the other party) to all
premises, properties, financial and accounting records, Contracts, other
records and documents, and personnel of or pertaining to such party, all in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the
representatives of the Company may have the access to the Parent permitted
hereunder only in order to conduct customary due diligence regarding the
completeness of the Parent SEC Reports, the subject matter of the Parents
representations and warranties under Article 3, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and the other information set forth herein as the Company may
reasonably request. No investigation or examination by either party shall
diminish, obviate or constitute a waiver of the enforcement of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other party under
this Agreement.



     | 4.9 | COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS; FURTHER ACTION 
---|---|--- 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (exercised diligently and
in good faith) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all other things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all necessary
waivers, consents, authorizations and approvals and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings, and otherwise to satisfy or cause to be satisfied
all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement. In the event
that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Stockholder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and take all such
actions reasonably requested by the Parent, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Surviving Corporation, the Parent and the Company, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses, or which could reasonably be
expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain
such consent.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parent shall not be obligated to divest, abandon, license, dispose of, hold
separate or take similar action with respect to any portion of the business,
assets or properties (tangible or intangible) of the Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company in connection with seeking to obtain or obtaining
any waiver, consent, authorization or approval of any Person associated with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 52 (c) If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
the Merger Sub, the Stockholder Representative and the officers and directors
of the Company and the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or desirable action.



     | 4.10 | PROXY STATEMENT; PARENT STOCKHOLDER MEETING. 
---|---|--- 

(a) If, after the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing, the closing
stock price of Parents Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market
reaches a price that would reasonably be expected to result in the possible
number of Merger Shares to be issued by Parent in the Merger to be equal to a
number that would require the Parents stockholders to approve this Agreement
and the Merger under applicable Law or the rules of the Nasdaq National
Market, the Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such requirement
and (ii) shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval
of the Parents stockholders to approve the Merger and this Agreement and to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (subject to the
determination by the Board of Directors of the Parent in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that recommending that the Parents
stockholders approve the Merger and this Agreement in accordance with clause
(ii) above would be inconsistent with the proper discharge of its fiduciary
duties to the Parents stockholders under applicable Law). As promptly as
practical after such notification, the Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the
stockholders of Parent in connection with the meeting of Parents stockholders
to consider this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (the "
_Parent Stockholder Meeting_ "). Upon request of the Parent, the Company shall
promptly provide the Parent with any required information about the Company or
the Company Stockholders for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. Parent will
promptly respond to any comments of the SEC and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
practicable after such filing and Parent will cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after both the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. Parent will notify the Company promptly
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other

Claim_ "), Section 9.2(a)(ii)(B) (each a " _Security Holder Fraud Claim_ ")
or Section 9.2(b)(B) (each a " _Parent Fraud Claim_ "); 
---|---|--- 



     | (III) | claims under Section 9.2(a)(i)(F) (only insofar as a claim
under such Section relates to a Company Fraud Claim, Section 9.2(a)(ii)(C)
(only insofar as a claim under such Section relates to a Title Claim or a

---|---|--- 
(B) Indemnification for claims under Section 9.2(a)(i)(A) or a Third Party
Action related thereto pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i)(F) shall be payable by

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 65  aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered under this
Article 9 from the Company Stockholders and the Eligible Derivative
Security Holders shall not exceed the amount of the Escrowed Merger
Consideration in the Escrow Fund (the "Company Cap") and the liability of any
Company Stockholder or Eligible Derivative Security Holder under this
Agreement shall not exceed that amount equal to such Company Stockholders or
Eligible Derivative Security Holders pro rata interest of the Escrowed Merger
Consideration and shall be satisfied solely through the Escrow Fund.

(D) The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
under this Article 9 from any Company Stockholder or Eligible
Derivative Security Holder for Company Fraud Claims, or a Third Party Action
related thereto, shall not exceed the pro rata interest of such Company
Stockholder or Eligible Derivative Security Holder in the Adjusted Merger
Consideration. Any amount to be paid by a Company Stockholder or an Eligible
Derivative Security Holder for indemnification with respect to a Company Fraud
Claim or a Third Party Action with respect thereto shall be paid first out of
the Escrowed Merger Consideration and thereafter shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Persons severally and not jointly.

(E) Indemnification for all Losses arising out of or resulting from a Title
Claim, a Security Holder Fraud Claim or a Third Party Action resulting from
any of the foregoing shall be payable solely and exclusively by the Company
Stockholder or Eligible Derivative Security Holder that committed the
intentional fraud giving rise to such Security Holder Fraud Claim or breached
the title representation giving rise to such Title Claim (such holder, a
"Breaching Holder"). Indemnification for all Losses arising out of or
resulting from a Title Claim, a Security Holder Fraud Claim or Third Party
Action resulting from or arising out of a Title Claim or Security Holder Fraud
Claim shall not be satisfied through a claim against the Escrow Fund;
provided, however, that the Parent may recover from the Escrow Fund such
Breaching Holders pro rata interest in the Escrow Fund, but only pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered under
this Article 9 from a Breaching Holder for a Title Claim, or a Third Party
Action related thereto, shall not exceed the pro rata interest of such
Breaching Holder in the Adjusted Merger Consideration. There shall be no limit
on the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from a Breaching Holder for Security Holders Fraud Claims or a Third Party
Action related thereto. In no event shall any Company Stockholder or Eligible
Derivative Security Holder (other than the Breaching Holder) be liable in any
respect for any Title Claim, Security Holder Fraud Claim or a Third Party
Action resulting from or arising out of any Title Claim or Security Holder
Fraud Claim.

(F) Indemnification for claims under Section 9.2(b)(A) or a Third Party Action
related thereto pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(C) shall be payable by the Parent
only if and to the extent the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds an
amount equal to $500,000 (the "Parent Deductible"). The Parents liability for
indemnification under Section 9.2(b) shall not exceed the Company Cap (the
"Parent Cap"); provided however that the Parent Cap shall not apply to Losses
arising out of or relating to a Parent Fraud Claim or a Third Party Action
with respect thereto.

accordance with this Article 9, the Escrowed Merger Shares shall be valued at

     | 9.3 | DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY 
---|---|--- 

(a) If a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof is to be
made by a Parent Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder (an " _Indemnified Person_ "), the Parent
Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified Person claiming such
indemnification will give written notice to the Stockholder Representative (in
the case of a Parent Indemnified Person) or the Parent (in the case of a
Company Indemnified Person) promptly after the Indemnified Person becomes
aware of any fact, condition or event which may give rise to Losses for which
indemnification may be sought under Section 9.2 hereof (such written notice, a
" _Claim Notice_ "), and such Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the individual items of Losses, the basis for the anticipated liability and
the nature of the breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
giving rise to such Losses. The omission to give a Claim Notice to the
Stockholder Representative or the Parent, as the case may be, will not relieve
the party obligated to provide indemnification under this Article 9 (an "
_Indemnifying Person_ ") of any liability hereunder except, and to the extent
that, he or it was prejudiced thereby.

(b) In the case of a claim for indemnification made by a Parent Indemnified
Person pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i)(F) or Section 9.2(a)(ii)(C) (whether
pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise, but not including any
Tax Contests, a " _Third Party Action_ "), by written notice by the
Stockholder Representative to the Parent within thirty (30) calendar days
after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of a Claim Notice relating to
such Third Party Action, the Stockholder Representative may, at its own cost
and expense, elect to assume control of the defense, investigation,
negotiation and settlement of such Third Party Action provided, however, that
prior to assuming control of such Third Party Action, the Stockholder
Representative shall agree that the Company Indemnified Persons shall be
obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Person and hold the Parent
Indemnified Person harmless from and against any and all Losses caused by or
arising out of any settlement of such Third Party Action or any judgment in
connection with such Third Party Action when and only if it is finally
determined that such Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) hereof. The Stockholder Representative shall
pursue the defense thereof in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings
promptly taken or instituted and diligently pursued, including, without
limitation, to employ and engage counsel of its own choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent Indemnified Person to handle and defend the same,
and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled (but shall not be
obligated), if it so elects, to compromise or settle such claim, which
compromise or settlement shall only be made with the written consent of the
Parent Indemnified Person, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
provided that the Stockholder Representative shall not in the defense of the
Third Party Action enter into any settlement which does not include as a term
thereof the giving by the third party claimant of an unconditional release of
the Parent Indemnified Person, or consent to entry of any judgment against the
Parent Indemnified Person except with the consent of the Parent Indemnified
Person. 

(c) In the event the Stockholder Representative elects to assume control of
the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or other legal action in
accordance with Section 9.3(b),  



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 67  the Parent Indemnified Person may, at its own cost and expense, participate
in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Action;
provided that, if the named persons to a lawsuit or other legal action
include both the Indemnifying Person and the Parent Indemnified Person and (x)
the Parent Indemnified Person has been advised in writing by counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Parent Indemnified
Person that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Person and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is
advisable for the Parent Indemnified Person to employ separate legal counsel
or (y) the amount of the Escrowed Merger Consideration is reasonably likely to
be insufficient to satisfy any Losses resulting from any Third Party Action,
the Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain one firm of
separate counsel of its own choosing to participate in the defense and the
Indemnifying Person shall reimburse the Parent Indemnified Person for expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of such Third Party Action
when and if it is finally determined that such Parent Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a). Nothing contained in
this Section 9.3(c) shall be deemed to expand, extend, modify, eliminate or
otherwise alter the express provisions of Section 9.2(c) relating to the
limitations and conditions on indemnification.

(d) If the Stockholder Representative fails to assume the defense of such
Third Party Action in accordance with this Section 9.3(c), within thirty (30)
calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Person
against which such Third Party Action has been asserted shall (upon
delivering notice to such effect to the Stockholder Representative) have the
right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Persons cost and expense, the
defense, compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Action on behalf of
and for the account of the Indemnifying Person; provided that such Third Party
Action shall not be compromised or settled without the written consent of the
Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. 

(e) In the event the Stockholder Representative assumes the defense of a Third
Party Action pursuant to Section 9.3(b), the Stockholder Representative shall
keep the Parent Indemnified Person reasonably informed of the progress of any
such defense, compromise or settlement, and in the event the Parent
Indemnified Person assumes the defense of the claim pursuant to Section
9.3(c), the Parent Indemnified Person shall keep the Stockholder
Representative reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense,
compromise or settlement. Each party hereto shall provide the Indemnified
Person reasonable access to his, her or its records and personnel relating to
any Third Party Claim during normal business hours and shall otherwise
cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense or settlement thereof.
The Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any Third Party
Action effected pursuant to and in accordance with Section 9.3 and for any
final judgment (subject to any right of appeal).



     | 9.4 | MISCELLANEOUS 
---|---|--- 

(a) If any Loss is recoverable under more than one provision hereof, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to assert a claim for such Loss until the
expiration of the longest period of time within which to assert a claim for
Loss under any of the provisions which are applicable.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 68 (b) The gross amount with respect to a claim for indemnification for which an
Indemnifying Person may be liable to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Article 9 shall be reduced by: (x) any insurance proceeds actually recovered
by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person on account of the indemnifiable
Loss; (y) any recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Person from
third parties pursuant to indemnification or otherwise with respect thereto
(net of cost of recovery); and (z) any tax benefit to such Person attributable
to amounts indemnified against. A tax benefit will be considered to be
recognized by an Indemnified Person for purposes of this Section 9.4 at the
time it reduces the aggregate tax liability of such Indemnified Person.

(c) Following the Closing, the indemnification expressly provided in this
Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach
of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company, the
Company Stockholders, the Eligible Derivative Security Holders, the Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, or any other
agreement or certificate contemplated by the Agreement to which the Company,
a Company Stockholder, an Eligible Derivative Security Holder, the Parent or
Merger Sub is a party, and the Company, the Company Stockholders, The Eligible
Derivative Security Holders, the Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and
all other remedies. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall
give rise to any right on the part of the Company, the Company Stockholders,
the Eligible Derivative Security Holders, the Parent or Merger Sub, after the
consummation of the Merger, to rescind this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.



     | 12.6 | ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS 
---|---|---

 |  | Page 84  assign any of its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Company to any direct wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or to any entity that acquires at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or assets of the Parent. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects
upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the
parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement.



     | 12.7 | SEVERABILITY 
---|---|--- 

(a) If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such
provision to any party or circumstances shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the
remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to such
party or circumstances other than those to which it is so determined to be
invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision
hereof shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any item or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that
the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power, to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases and to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified.

(b) The parties agree that the Parent Breakup Fee provided in Section 10.3(b)
is fair and reasonable under the circumstances. If a court of competent
jurisdiction shall nonetheless, by a final, non-appealable judgment, determine
that such amounts exceed the maximum amount permitted by law, then such
amounts shall be reduced to the maximum amount permitted by law in the
circumstances, as determined by such court of competent jurisdiction.



     | 12.8 | GOVERNING LAW 
---|---|--- 

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is
vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto
(i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in
the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 |  | Page 85  over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware and (iv) consents to service
being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 12.3. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S registered mail to the respective addresses
set forth in Section 12.3 shall be effective service of process for any suit
or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.



     | 12.9 | COUNTERPARTS 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when
taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.



     | 12.10 | INTERPRETATION 
---|---|--- 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: (a) each party and its counsel
reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this Agreement and have
contributed to its revision; (b) the rule of construction to the effect that
any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed
in the interpretation of this Agreement; and (c) the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to all parties hereto and not in
favor of or against any party, regardless of which party was generally
responsible for the preparation of this Agreement and (d) references to
agreements and other documents shall be deemed to include all subsequent
amendments and other modifications thereto and (e) the schedules and exhibits
to this Agreement are a material part hereof and shall be treated as if fully
incorporated into the body of this Agreement.



     | 12.11 | ENTIRE AGREEMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER 
---|---|--- 

(a) This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement), whether written or oral, between or among the
parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the
documents referred to in this Agreement) the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be amended by
the parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholders or the
stockholders of the Parent approve this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
after any such approval, there shall not be made any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the Company Stockholders or the stockholders of
the Parent without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties, except that the written agreement of the Stockholder
Representative to any such amendment need not be obtained unless the parties
seek to amend a section of this Agreement which addresses the rights or duties
of the Stockholder Representative.

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may: (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties; (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; or (iii) subject to the proviso of Section
12.11(a), waive compliance by another party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any right preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or of any other right.
