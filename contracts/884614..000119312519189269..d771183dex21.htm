(b) Closing Indebtedness and (c) (i) plus Closing Net Working Capital, if

_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

2.3 _Preliminary Closing Statement_. Not later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written statement
setting forth in reasonable detail (a) Sellers good-faith estimate based on
information then available to Seller of (i) Closing Indebtedness (" _Estimated
Closing Indebtedness_ ") and (ii) Closing Net Working Capital (" _Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital_ "), and (b) on the basis of the foregoing,
Sellers calculation of the Estimated Closing Purchase Price.

 

2.4 _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) _Calculation of Adjustments_. As promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date, and in any event not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement (the "
_Final Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail (i) Buyers
good-faith calculation of (A) Closing Net Working Capital and (B) Closing
Indebtedness, and (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, Buyers calculation of
the Purchase Price. Buyer agrees to give Seller and its authorized
Representatives access during regular business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to any Representatives, facilities and books and records of the
Company and Buyer as are reasonably necessary to allow Seller and its
authorized Representatives to verify the amounts set forth in the Final
Closing Statement.

(b) _Dispute Procedures_. If Seller disagrees with any of Buyers calculations
contained in the Final Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice
(a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail
the particulars of such disagreement, including the specific items and amounts
in dispute (the " _Disputed Items_ "), together with Sellers rationale for
disputing such items and reasonable supporting details and calculations,
within sixty (60) days after its receipt of the Final Closing Statement (the "
_Dispute Period_ "). If Seller does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement on
or before the expiration of the Dispute Period, Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed to the Final Closing Statement (including the determinations included
therein) delivered by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder. If Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement on or
before the expiration of the Dispute Period, then (i) Buyer and Seller shall
use their good-faith efforts to resolve any Disputed Items with respect to
any calculations contained in the Final Closing Statement and (ii) Seller
shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the
Final Closing Statement that are not specifically identified in such Notice
of Disagreement.

(c) _Independent Accountant_. If Buyer and Seller have not signed an agreement
resolving the Disputed Items by the sixtieth (60th) day following Buyers
receipt of a Notice of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), then the
Disputed Items may be submitted by Buyer or Seller to the Independent
Accountant for resolution at any time after the end of the Resolution Period.
The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to render its determination in
writing with respect to the Disputed Items as soon as reasonably possible
(which the Parties agree should not

 



13

    

 be later than ninety (90) days following the date on which the disagreement
is referred to the Independent Accountant). The Independent Accountant shall
consider only the Disputed Items and shall base its determination solely on
(i) the written submissions of the Parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which Closing Net
Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness require adjustment in order to be
determined in accordance with this Agreement. The Independent Accountant shall
not assign a value to any Disputed Item submitted to the Independent
Accountant greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
Party. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by
the Parties as designated by the Independent Accountant, which designation
shall be based upon the inverse proportion of the dollar value of the
Disputed Items resolved in favor of such Party (i.e., so that the prevailing
Party bears a lesser amount of such fees and expenses).

 

(d) _Binding Effect_. If a Notice of Disagreement is timely given pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing
Indebtedness, as applicable, shall be deemed determined on the date that the
Independent Accountant gives notice to Buyer and Seller of its determination
with respect to all Disputed Items, or, if earlier, the date on which Seller
and Buyer agree in writing on the amount thereof, in which case the Closing
Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness, as applicable, shall be
calculated in accordance with such determination or agreement, as the case may
be. Any determination of the Closing Net Working Capital and Closing
Indebtedness by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Buyer and Seller. The date on which Closing Net Working Capital
and Closing Indebtedness is deemed to be finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_ or _2.4(d)_ , as the case may be, is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

 

(e) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, shall mean the Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_ or _2.4(d)_ , as applicable) _minus_ the
Estimated Closing Purchase Price. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number (such amount, the " _Increase Amount_ "), then, promptly following the
Determination Date, and in any event within two (2) Business Days after the
Determination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Increase
Amount in US dollars and in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a
bank account designated by Seller. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative
number (the absolute value of such amount, the " _Deficit Amount_ "), then,
promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days after the Determination Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the Deficit Amount in US dollars and in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to an account designated by Buyer.

 

2.5 _Withholding_. The Parties shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law, with respect to the
making of such payment; provided, that, Buyer shall provide commercially
reasonable notice to Seller upon becoming aware of any such withholding
obligation and shall cooperate with Seller in good faith and to the extent
reasonable to obtain any available reduction of, or relief from, such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Party in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

designated Affiliate is at a substantially similar or greater level of
seniority as compared to the position held by the applicable Available
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date even if it provides for
different or greater levels of responsibility or duties, but only if any such
difference in responsibility or duties is reasonably appropriate given such
Available Employees qualifications and experience level. In the event that
Buyer and Seller reasonably determine that the total cash compensation
opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity and long-term
incentives and health, welfare and retirement benefits) to be provided by
Buyer pursuant to clauses (B) and (C) of the first sentence of this _Section_
__ _ 7.4(b)(i)_ do not provide substantially comparable value as compared to
the total cash compensation opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, equity and long-term incentives and health, welfare and retirement
benefits) as reflected in the

 



36

    

 Available Employee Data, any such shortfall in value shall be provided in
the form of a cash bonus, the amount of which shall be reasonably agreed to by
Buyer and Seller, payable by Buyer to the applicable Transferred Employees
not later than the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date,
subject to continued employment through the applicable payment date. In the
event an offer of employment requires a Geographic Relocation and the
applicable Available Employee does not accept such offer, Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for severance costs of Seller or the applicable Seller
Affiliate related to the termination of such Available Employee in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in amounts
consistent with the severance benefits described on _Schedule 7.4(k)_. In the
event an offer of employment requires a Geographic Relocation and the
applicable Available Employee accepts such offer, Buyer shall provide such
Available Employee with a relocation package consistent with Buyers standard
relocation programs, as applicable based on the Available Employees job
grade. Except with respect to reimbursing the applicable Seller Affiliate for
severance costs associated with such Seller Affiliates termination in
connection with the Closing of an Available Employee who rejects an offer of
employment with Buyer that requires a Geographic Relocation, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not pay or have any liability with respect to any severance
or other separation compensation or benefits with respect to the termination
of the employment with Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate of any
Available Employee who accepts or rejects an offer of employment with Buyer
(or its designated Affiliate). The Parties intend that Seller and the Seller
Affiliates shall not pay or have any liability with respect to any severance
or other separation compensation or benefits with respect to the termination
of the employment with Seller or the applicable Seller Affiliate of any
Available Employee who accepts an offer of employment with Buyer (or its
designated Affiliate), provided that, except as otherwise provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)(i)_, Buyer assumes no obligation or liability in
respect of any such severance or other separation compensation or benefits
under any Seller Benefit Plan. Other than as stated in  _Section_ __ _
7.4(b)(ii)_ below with respect to Inactive Employees, the offers of employment
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall be conditioned upon the Closing
and may be conditioned upon such lawful, standard pre-employment screenings
and background checks as Buyer customarily employs in connection with its
hiring processes; _provided that_ , any such screenings and background checks
that are not completed prior to Closing shall not delay the Available
Employees Transfer Date.

(ii) At least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a list of Available Employees who have rejected an offer of employment
from Buyer (or its designated Affiliate). With respect to each Available
Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Buyer (or its designated
Affiliate), such Available Employees employment with Seller or the applicable
Seller Affiliate shall terminate immediately prior to his or her Transfer
Date, and such Available Employee shall become an employee of Buyer (or its
designated Affiliate) on the Transfer Date and shall be referred to herein as
a " _Transferred Employee_." With respect to any Available Employee who is
absent from active employment as a result of an approved leave of absence on
the Closing Date (each such Available Employee, an " _Inactive Employee_ "),
Buyers offer of employment to the Inactive Employee may be conditioned on
such Inactive Employees ability to return to active employment (full or
part-time) within a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date (or
such longer period as may otherwise be required by

 



37

    

 applicable Law), or, in the case of an Inactive Employee who has been
granted a leave of absence for military service under the Uniformed Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, as amended, Buyers offer of
employment may be conditioned on such employees reasonable satisfaction of
the requirements thereunder for reinstatement. An Inactive Employee who
accepts Buyers offer of employment and becomes eligible to return to active
employment with Seller after the Closing Date in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)(ii)_ shall become a Transferred Employee on the
Transfer Date.

 

(c) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(d)_, Seller or the applicable
Seller Affiliate shall pay to the Transferred Employees all compensation,
bonuses and incentive payments earned by and payable to the Transferred
Employees through the applicable Transfer Date in accordance with the terms
and conditions (including within the timing and form specified for payment
therefor) of each applicable Seller Benefit Plan.

(d) Except where accrued vacation and personal time amounts are required to
be paid to Available Employees by Seller upon their termination of employment
from Seller, Buyer (or its designated Affiliate) shall, effective as of each
Transferred Employees Transfer Date, credit the Transferred Employees for all
earned or accrued but unused vacation and personal time benefits of the
Transferred Employees, which current unused vacation and personal time
benefits for each Transferred Employee shall be identified by Seller within
five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date in the form of _Schedule_ __ _
7.4(d)_ (which information Seller may update or supplement with respect to
Inactive Employees who become Transferred Employees after the Closing Date),
and Seller and the Seller Affiliates shall be relieved of all liabilities for
such benefits. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (or any
schedule hereto) to the contrary, all accrued vacation amounts to be credited
for Transferred Employees by Buyer or its Affiliates will be treated as
Working Capital Liabilities in the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital, but only to the extent that the amount of accrued vacation to be
credited pursuant to the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(d)_
exceeds the amount of vacation and other personal time benefits that Buyer or
an applicable Affiliate of Buyer grants to similarly-situated newly-hired
employees who did not commence employment therewith as a result of a
corporate transaction. Where required by applicable Law, Seller or the
applicable Seller Affiliate shall pay out all earned or accrued but unused
vacation and personal time benefits to the Transferred Employees as soon
as administratively practicable following the applicable Transfer Date. Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, permit each Transferred Employee,
during the Transition Period (i) to accrue additional vacation and other paid
time off days (e.g., personal days), if any, to which the Transferred
Employee would be entitled under the vacation and other paid time off policies
of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate (taking into account the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(g)_) and (ii) to take vacation and other paid time off
days for the amounts of any vacation and paid time off days accrued during the
Transition Period to the extent, and in the same manner, as any
such Transferred Employee could take vacation and paid time off days under
the applicable vacation and paid time off policies of Buyer. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent the vacation and other paid
time off policies of Buyer or its applicable Affiliate would cause the
forfeiture of any unused vacation or personal time benefits of a Transferred
Employee as of the Transfer Date that are credited by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(d)_, Buyer shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to)
promptly pay out to such Transferred Employee the value of such forfeited
assumed vacation or personal time benefits.

 



38

    

(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this  _Section_
__ _ 7.4_, Seller and the Seller Affiliates shall retain all liabilities in
respect of benefits earned and accrued as of immediately prior to the
applicable Transfer Date by Transferred Employees under the Seller
Benefit Plans, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
liability with respect thereto or with respect to any other Benefit Plan that
at any time is or has been maintained, sponsored or contributed to (or was
required to be contributed to) by Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates or
ERISA Affiliates and that has not at any time been maintained, sponsored or
contributed to (or was required to be contributed to) by Buyer or any of the
Affiliates of Buyer or ERISA Affiliates (if "Buyer" or "Affiliate of Buyer"
were substituted for "Company" as used in the definition of "ERISA Affiliate")
thereof (such as a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37)(A) of
ERISA). Seller and the Seller Affiliates will retain all assets and
liabilities related to the Seller Benefit Plans.

(f) Seller and the Seller Affiliates shall retain, bear and discharge all
liabilities for claims of Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
incurred prior to the applicable Transfer Date under the Seller Benefit Plans
that provide health, disability, life insurance, accident or other benefits
coverage or insurance, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall retain, bear and
discharge all liabilities for claims of Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents incurred on and after the applicable Transfer Date under
the Buyer Benefit Plans. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(f)_, except
as otherwise provided by the parties applicable insurance policies, a claim
will be deemed "incurred" on the date that the event that gives rise to the
claim occurs (for purposes of life insurance and accident programs, and
disability programs) or on the date that treatment, material or services are
provided (for purposes of health care).

 

(g) Effective on the applicable Transfer Date, and for the Transition Period,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide the Transferred Employees with
employee benefits that satisfy the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.
Buyer shall provide that all Transferred Employees (and, to the extent
applicable, their eligible dependents) shall be eligible immediately upon
the applicable Transfer Date to commence active participation in the
applicable Buyer Benefit Plans. Buyer and its Affiliates shall, with respect
to the Buyer Benefit Plans in which the Transferred Employees (and, to the
extent applicable, their eligible dependents) are eligible to participate,
recognize all service of the Transferred Employees with Seller and the Seller
Affiliates and with any predecessor employer (to the extent such predecessor
employer service was taken into account under the applicable Seller Benefit
Plans) for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and receive
benefits, and, with respect to severance, vacation and paid time off plans,
for purposes of calculating the level of benefits. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer shall not be required to recognize such service for purposes of
benefit accruals under the defined benefit pension plans or post-retirement
welfare benefit plans of Buyer and its Affiliates covering the
Transferred Employees.

(h) With respect to Buyer Benefit Plans that provide welfare benefits, Buyer
shall use its best efforts to ensure that Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents shall not be subject to any eligibility period, waiting
period, elimination period, evidence of insurability requirements, active at
work requirements, pre-existing condition or similar limitations. 

 



39

    

(i) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Buyer shall, for the Transferred Employees, establish or
designate one or more Buyer DC Plans and take all necessary action to cause
the Buyer DC Plan to be tax-qualified under the applicable provisions of the
Code (to the extent the Buyer DC Plan is not so tax-qualified). Buyer and
Seller shall take all actions necessary to allow the Transferred Employees to
make eligible rollover contributions to the Buyer DC Plan of their account
balances (including the rollover of any loans, if applicable) from the Seller
DC Plan as soon as practicable following the Closing.

 

(j) As of the applicable Transfer Date, the Transferred Employees shall no
longer be active participants in the Seller Benefit Plans, except
as otherwise required by the express terms of such plans or by applicable
Law.

(k) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred
Employee any right to continued employment with Buyer or its Affiliates, nor
shall anything herein interfere with the right of Buyer or its Affiliates to
relocate or terminate the employment of any of the Transferred Employees at
any time on or after the Closing Date. Buyer shall bear the cost and expense
of the termination (or alleged termination) of the employment of any
Transferred Employee by Buyer on or after the Closing Date. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall, for each Transferred Employee who, within the Transition
Period, (i) is involuntarily terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
without Cause, (ii) has his or her base salary (or, as applicable, base hourly
wage rate) or bonus opportunity reduced other than a reduction by reason of a
circumstance that constitutes Cause, and such Transferred Employee elects to
and does terminate his or her employment with Buyer or its Affiliates, or
(iii) elects to and does terminate his or her employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates following a requirement that such Transferred Employee take an
alternative position that requires a Geographic Relocation (or otherwise
requires such Transferred Employee to undergo a Geographic
Relocation), provide severance and other separation benefits to each such
Transferred Employee that are at least equal to the greatest of (A) the
severance benefits for which such Available Employee was eligible as of
immediately prior to the Transfer Date (as described in _Schedule 7.4(k)_ ),
(B) the severance benefits provided for under the severance plans, policies or
arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates, as applicable, as of the time of
such termination, and (C) four (4) calendar weeks of severance and other
separation benefits, which severance benefits, in all cases, shall be paid in
a single lump sum within sixty (60) days after the date of the Transferred
Employees termination of employment with Buyer and its Affiliates; provided,
however, that such separation benefits may be contingent upon the Transferred
Employees execution, and non-revocation of, a standard general release and
waiver agreement. Seller shall bear all liability for any claims of any
Available Employee arising out of the employment or termination (or alleged
termination) of employment of any Available Employee with Seller prior to the
Transfer Date. Buyer shall bear all liability for any claims of any
Transferred Employee arising out of the employment (or alleged employment) or
termination (or alleged termination) of employment by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates of any Transferred Employee on or after the Transfer Date.

 

(l) Except as expressly set forth herein or as provided to the contrary by
applicable Law, Buyer shall be responsible for all liabilities in respect of
the employment of and the compensation and benefits earned or accrued on and
after the Transfer Date by Transferred Employees under the Buyer Benefit
Plans, and none of Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates shall have any
liability with respect thereto.

 



40

    

(m) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, be liable to the
Seller Indemnitees for and hold each Seller Indemnitees harmless from, any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by each Seller Indemnitee to the extent
arising out of any failure of Buyer or its Affiliates to discharge their
respective obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

(n) Seller and the Seller Affiliates shall be responsible for all workers
compensation claims by any Available Employee arising out of any injuries and
diseases incurred, sustained, or resulting from work-related exposures or
conditions prior to the Transfer Date (regardless of whether the claim related
thereto is filed after the Transfer Date). Buyer shall be responsible for all
workers compensation claims by any of the Transferred Employees arising out
of any injuries and diseases incurred, sustained, or resulting from work-
related exposures or conditions on or after the Transfer Date.

(o) With the exception of matters addressed in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, for
a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, directly or indirectly
hire or solicit, encourage or induce any employee of Seller or any of the
Seller Affiliates with or about whom Buyer or its Affiliates interacted or
obtained confidential information in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to become an employee, contractor or consultant
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates whether or not such employee would breach
such employees Contract of employment with any of Seller or any of the Seller
Affiliates by doing so; provided that the foregoing prohibition shall not be
deemed or construed to prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from hiring such
employees as a result of: (i) pursuing employee recruiting and hiring
practices not targeted at such employees, including the publication of notices
of employment opportunities in websites, newspapers, or other periodicals of
general or industry-specific circulation; or (ii) using a third party
recruiter or employment firm that has not been specifically directed by Buyer
or its Affiliates to contact such employees.

 

(p) All provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are included for the
sole benefit of the Parties hereto and nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to (i) give rise to any rights, claims, benefits or causes of action to
any Available Employee, Transferred Employee or other individual or (ii)
prevent, restrict, or limit Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates,
following the Closing Date, from modifying or terminating any benefit plans,
programs or policies from time to time as it may deem appropriate, subject
only to compliance with the express provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_
for the benefit of Seller. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall be
deemed to amend or be construed as an amendment or modification to any Seller
Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or other Benefit Plan.

7.5 _Public Announcements_. Neither Party (nor any of their respective
Affiliates) shall issue any press release or similar public announcement
pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, as reasonably determined by the Party issuing such press release or
making such public announcement, in which case such issuing or announcing
Party shall provide at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of such
press release or public announcement to the other Party for review and
comment.

 



41

    

7.6 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fee
or expense, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.

 

7.7 _Removal of Retained Marks; Name Change_. Retained Marks will appear on
some of the assets of the Company Group Members, including on signage
throughout the real property and pipeline rights of way of the Company Group
Members, and on supplies, materials, stationery, brochures, advertising
materials, manuals and similar consumable items of the Company Group Members.
Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or any other right
whatsoever to use the Retained Marks. Buyer shall (a) within one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, remove the Retained Marks from the
assets of the Company Group Members, including signage on the real and
personal property of the Company Group Members, and provide written
verification thereof to Seller promptly after completing such removal, and (b)
within two (2) weeks after the Closing Date, return or destroy all
stationery, brochures, advertising materials, manuals and similar consumable
items of the Company Group Members that contain any Retained Marks that are
not removable. Buyer will not conduct any business or offer any goods or
services under the Retained Marks. Buyer will not send, or cause to be sent,
any correspondence or other materials to any Person on any stationery that
contains any Retained Marks or otherwise operate the Company Group Members in
any manner which would or might confuse any Person into believing that Buyer
has any right, title, interest, or license to use the Retained Marks. Within
five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, for each Company Group Member
whose legal name includes a Retained Mark, Buyer shall file with the
appropriate Governmental Entity in such Company Group Members jurisdiction of
organization an amendment to such Company Group Members Organizational
Documents to remove such Retained Mark from such Company Group Members legal
name.

7.8 _Insurance_. Buyer acknowledges that, except as set forth on
_Schedule 7.8_ , at or promptly following the Closing, the insurance policies
maintained by Seller and any Seller Affiliates for the benefit of any of the
Company Group Members shall be terminated or modified to exclude coverage of
all of the Company Group Members, and, as a result, Buyer shall be obligated
at or before Closing to obtain at its sole cost and expense replacement
insurance, including insurance required by any Third Party to be maintained by
or for the benefit of any of the Company Group Members. If required by Law or
contract, Buyer shall provide to Governmental Entities and Third Parties
evidence of such replacement or substitute insurance coverage for the
continued operations of the Business following the Closing.

 

7.9 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts; Intercompany Balances_. At or prior
to the Closing, Seller shall terminate or cause to be terminated each of the
Contracts listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.9_. At or prior to Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause each Seller Affiliate (other than the Company or any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary) to take such action as may be required so
that (a) all intercompany accounts receivable and notes and loans receivable
relating to the Business and between a Company Group Member, on the one hand,
and Seller or a Seller Affiliate (excluding the Company Group Members),
on the other hand, and (b) all intercompany accounts payable and notes and
loans payable or any other Indebtedness for Borrowed Money relating to the
Business, and between a Company Group Member, on the one hand, and Seller or a
Seller Affiliate (excluding the Company Group Members), on the other hand, in
each case, will be terminated, transferred out of the applicable Company Group
Member or otherwise eliminated or settled with no liability to Buyer or the
Company Group Members following Closing, it being understood that such
intercompany accounts, as so settled, shall not be included in the calculation
of Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness.

 



42

    

7.10 _D andO Indemnity_. Until the sixth (6 _th_ ) anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the Company Group Members to maintain in effect and
continue to provide to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and other
limitations on liability currently existing in favor of any current or former
officer, manager, director or similar individual of the Company Group Members
(the " _Seller D andO Indemnitees_") under, and in no event on terms less
favorable than those contained in, the Organizational Documents of the Company
Group Members in effect on the Effective Date. In the event that Buyer, the
Company Group Members or any of its or their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Buyer and the Company Group Members, as the case
may be, shall succeed to and be bound by the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.10_. The obligations of Buyer under this _Section_ __ _
7.10_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to materially
and adversely affect any Seller DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ __ _
7.10_ applies without the written consent of such affected Seller DandO
Indemnitee.

7.11  _No Ongoing or Transition Services_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that at the Closing, except as provided for in the Transition Services
Agreement, all data processing, accounting, insurance, banking, personnel,
legal, tax, communications, information technology, human resources, health,
safety and environment and corporate and other products and services provided
to the Company Group Members by Seller or any of the Seller Affiliates (other
than a Company Group Member), including any agreements or understandings
(written or oral) with respect thereto, will terminate.

7.12 _Pennant Holdco_. If the Closing will occur prior to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement  Pennant, then
Seller shall cause the Company to (a) assign to Pennant Holdco the Amended and
Restated Construction and Operation Services Agreement dated September 30,
2015 by and among Pennant Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(" _Pennant Midstream_ "), and the Company (the " _Pennant Operating
Agreement_ ") and (b) distribute to Seller all of the membership interests in
Pennant Holdco.

7.13 _Excluded Assets; Lancer Pipeline_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding _Article 6_ , the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement exclude, and prior to the Closing Date Seller shall cause the
Company Group Members to transfer to Seller or any Seller Affiliates, the
Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers representations and warranties in _Article 4_ shall not
apply to any of the Excluded Assets.

 



43

    

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Excluded Assets include certain
intellectual property, Retained Marks, information technology hardware and
software, and information technology hardware and software services and
licensing Contracts used to conduct the Business and set forth on _Schedule
7.13(b)_ (collectively, the " _Excluded IT Assets_ "). In the event that
Buyer is unable at the Closing Date to replace such Excluded IT Assets
internally from Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or externally from a Third
Party, Seller will, at Buyers sole cost and expense, after the Closing,
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, subject to applicable Law and
the terms and conditions of any Contracts relating to the Excluded IT Assets,
provide the Company Group Members with such access to, and continued use of,
the Excluded IT Assets as is reasonably necessary for Buyer to conduct the
Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice on the terms
provided in the Transition Services Agreement. To the extent not in
the possession and control of the Company Group Members at the time of
Closing, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer to provide for the
transfer of all material information and data related to the conduct of the
Business stored on information technology assets owned or leased by Seller or
any Seller Affiliate to information technology assets owned or leased by the
Company Group Members, Buyer or any of its Affiliates as soon as reasonably
practical after the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 7.13(a)_, if, no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the projected Closing Date, Buyer requests that Seller
not transfer or convey the pipeline known as the Lancer Pipeline and all
associated right-of-way (the " _Lancer Assets_ ") to Seller or a Seller
Affiliate, then the Lancer Assets shall not be transferred or conveyed;
provided, however, that the Lancer Assets shall otherwise be treated as
Excluded Assets for all other purposes under this Agreement. Promptly
following the Effective Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, exercise reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer with any and
all information in its possession or otherwise available to it, relating to
the Lancer Assets, including by making any employees, consultants or other
representatives who may have information relating to the Lancer Assets
available to Buyer by phone or at the Companys facilities, in each case,
during normal business hours.

 

7.14 _Pre-Closing __Transactions_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause the applicable Seller Affiliates to, take all steps necessary
to transfer or assign to the appropriate Company Group Member the Contracts
and assets, and enter into such Contracts, in each case, set forth on 
_Schedule_ __ _ 7.14(a)_ (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Transactions_");
provided, however, that if the Pre-Closing Transactions are not consummated
at or prior to Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the applicable Seller
Affiliates to, (a) continue to take all steps necessary to consummate the Pre-
Closing Transactions as soon as possible following the Closing and (b) ensure
that Buyer and its Affiliates are granted adequate access, pursuant to the Use
and Access Agreement or otherwise, to all properties and facilities, including
those set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 7.14(a)_, necessary to operate the
Business as currently conducted.

7.15 _Shared Contracts_. Buyer acknowledges that there may be Contracts with
Third Parties to which one or more of the Company Group Members and Seller or
one or more Seller Affiliates are parties and which directly benefit both
Seller or a Seller Affiliate and one or more of the Company Group Members
(the " _Shared Contracts_ "), including the Contracts set forth on _Schedule_
__ _ 7.15_. Prior to the Closing and thereafter, if applicable, Seller shall
use Reasonable Efforts to cause each Shared Contract to be replaced with a
separate Contract that provides the respective Company Group Member with
rights and obligations substantially similar to the rights and obligations of
such Company Group Member contained in such Shared Contract, and Buyer shall
cooperate with Seller with respect thereto. If the Parties are not able to
effect the separation

 



44

    

 of a Shared Contract prior to the Closing as a result of any required
approval or consent of a Third Party, then, until such actions can be
effected, to the extent permissible under Law and the terms of any such
Shared Contract, the Parties shall enter into alternative arrangements
intended to provide the Company Group Members with the benefits of such Shared
Contract and to put the Parties in the same economic position as if such
Shared Contract were separated, as contemplated in this _Section_ __ _
7.15_.

7.16 _Cooperation with Financing_.

 

(a) Between the Effective Date and the Closing, Seller shall use Reasonable
Efforts to cooperate with Buyers reasonable requests in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
including using Reasonable Efforts to cause its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives, upon the reasonable request of Buyer and at Buyers
sole expense, (i) to furnish Buyer and its Financing Sources, as promptly as
practicable, the Required Information and all other pertinent information
relating to the Company Group Members and their business (including
information to be used in the preparation of an information package regarding
the business, operations, financial projections and prospects of the Company
Group Members customary for such financing or otherwise reasonably necessary
for the completion of the Financing by the Financing Sources) to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer to assist in preparation of customary offering
or other information documents to be used for the completion of the Financing;
(ii) to furnish Buyer and its Financing Sources customary authorization
letters authorizing the distribution of the Required Information in connection
with the Financing reasonably requested by Buyer; (iii) to reasonably
cooperate with the marketing efforts of Buyer, its representatives and the
Financing Sources for any portion of the Financing, including assisting
Buyers representatives with any business, financial, accounting and tax
review, and causing the senior management of the Business to provide detailed
evaluation of the financial model and forecasting processes related to the
Business and to participate at reasonable times in a reasonable number of
lender meetings and due diligence sessions with the Financing Sources at
reasonable times and locations, in each case, upon reasonable advance notice;
(iv) to assist in the preparation of any customary bank information memoranda;
(v) to furnish, no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each
fiscal quarter ending after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date,
unaudited balance sheets and related income, equity and cash flow statements
of the Company and for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, in each
case; (vi) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to
provide all documentation and other information about each of the Company
Group Members as is reasonably requested in writing by Buyer at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date which is in connection with
the Financing and relates to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Uniting
and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept
and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) and certification
regarding beneficial ownership required by the Beneficial Ownership Rule (31
CFR §1010.230); and (vii) to facilitate the execution and delivery (at the
Closing) of definitive documents to be executed by the Company Group Members
(or any of their respective lenders) related to the Financing as may
reasonably be requested by Buyer.

 



45

    

(b) Without affecting Buyers rights under this Agreement, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Seller Affiliates for and against
any and all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and the Seller Affiliates to the extent that such
losses arise from or are related to information provided by Seller or the
Seller Affiliates to Buyer in writing specifically for use in the Financing
that is inaccurate in any material respect or that omitted to include
information that was necessary to make the information provided not misleading
in any material respect, in light of the circumstances under which it was
made. Buyer shall promptly, upon Sellers request, reimburse Seller or the
Seller Affiliates for costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by Seller in connection with its cooperation contemplated by
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.16_.

7.17 _No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals_. Between the Effective Date
and the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
its Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (a) encourage, solicit, initiate, induce, facilitate or continue
inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal or take any other action intended
to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that constitute or could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (b) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a
possible Acquisition Proposal; or (c) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding, or consummate a transaction
involving, an Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates and all of its and their
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to, or that could lead to, any Acquisition Proposal and immediately prohibit
any access by any Person (other than Buyer, its Affiliates and
Representatives) to any physical or electronic data room relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal. Seller expressly agrees that the rights and
remedies for breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_ shall include having such
provision specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur to Buyer in the event any
of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_ were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened
to be breached by Seller, and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Buyer.

7.18 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer (i) shall use
its best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) described in the Commitment Letter pursuant to
the terms thereof and (ii) shall not permit any amendment or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Commitment Letter
if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) reduces (or could have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless the
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) or (B) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any other provision of the Commitment Letter, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (y) delay or prevent or make less likely the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the
Closing Date or (z) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or otherwise impair or delay the Closing or
the date on which the Financing would be obtained. Buyer shall promptly
deliver to Seller true and correct copies of any such amendment, modification
or replacement.

 



46

    

(b) Buyer shall use its best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Commitment
Letter, (ii) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contained in the Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable
to Buyer than the terms and conditions (including flex provisions) in the
Commitment Letter), (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to
receipt of the Financing at the Closing set forth in the Commitment Letter
that are within its control or subject to its influence and, upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its best
efforts (including through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause
the Financing Sources to fund the Financing at the Closing, (iv) to enforce
its rights (including through litigation pursued in good faith) under the
Commitment Letter, and (v) to comply with its obligations under the Commitment
Letter. Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to
Seller copies of drafts and definitive agreements for the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt
notice (y) of any breach or default by any party to any of the Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Buyer
becomes aware and (z) of the receipt of any written notice from any Financing
Source with respect to any actual breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Financing. If any portion of the Financing otherwise becomes
unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the Purchase
Price and all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall use its best efforts to arrange
and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with terms and conditions not materially less favorable to
Buyer than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Buyer shall deliver to Seller true and complete copies of all agreements and
contracts pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide any portion of the Financing. Buyer acknowledges that obtaining the
Financing in connection with the Closing is not a condition to
Buyer complying with its obligations under this Agreement, including closing
the transactions contemplated herein following satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions in _Article 8_ and _Article 9_.

 

7.19 _Casualty Loss_. If, after the Effective Date but before the Closing
Date, any portion of the assets of the Company Group Members (other than any
Excluded Assets) are damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, weather events,
earthquake, act of God, or other casualty (each a " _Casualty Loss_ "), then
Seller shall repair such damage or replace such destroyed assets (and retain
all insurance proceeds and the rights thereto); provided, however, that in no
event shall Sellers obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ exceed
$62,500,000 in the aggregate. The occurrence of any Casualty Loss shall not
delay the Closing if the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 8_ and
_Article 9_ have otherwise been satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any and all Casualty Losses shall
be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the
condition in _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ has been satisfied. No Casualty Loss shall
create any separate adjustment to the Purchase Price; provided that nothing
herein shall limit the indemnification obligations set forth in _Article 12_.

TERMINATION 

10.1 _Termination_. Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, this
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing in the following
manner:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, if any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction
over such matters shall have issued an order or injunction restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the sale of the Purchased Interests
hereunder and such order, decree, ruling, or other action shall have become
final and unappealable; provided that such Party has satisfied its obligations
under  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ in response to the actions or requests of such
Governmental Entity;

(c) by Seller; provided that Seller is not then in material breach of this
Agreement, if Buyer shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or has failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Buyer has become
untrue, in each case, such that (i) the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, as applicable, would not be satisfied as of the time of
such termination and (ii) such breach (A) is incapable of being cured by the
Outside Date or (B) if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, has not
been cured by Buyer within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from
Seller;

 



49

    

(d) by Buyer; provided that Buyer is not then in material breach of this
Agreement, if Seller shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or has failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Seller has become

_Section_ __ _ 9.2_, as applicable, would not be satisfied as of the time of
such termination and (ii) such breach (A) is incapable of being cured by
the Outside Date or (B) if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, has
not been cured by Seller within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
from Buyer; and

 

(e) by either Seller or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before October 31, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(e)_ shall
not be available to a Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Party. If a Party terminates this Agreement under

ARTICLE 11

TAX MATTERS 

11.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by any Company Group Member before the Closing
Date (each such Tax Return, a " _Seller-Prepared Tax Return_ "). Seller shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company Group Members due before
the Closing Date.

 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns in respect of any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
that are required to be filed by any Company Group Member on or after the
Closing Date (each such Tax Return, a " _Buyer-Prepared Tax Return_ ");
provided, however, that Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft of
any income, franchise or similar Buyer-Prepared Tax Return no less than
twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Buyer-Prepared Tax
Return for Sellers review and approval; provided, further, if the due date
for filing such Buyer-Prepared Tax Return is less than twenty (20) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft of such Buyer-
Prepared Tax Return within a commercially reasonable time after the Closing
Date. No such Buyer-Prepared Tax Return shall be filed by Buyer without
Sellers consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of Taxes shown as due on

 



50

    

 each Buyer-Prepared Tax Return that are allocable to a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date except to the extent such
Taxes were taken into account in the computation of Closing Net Working
Capital. In the case of any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date
and ends on or after the Closing Date, the amount of any Tax that is allocable
to the portion of such taxable period that is deemed to end at the end of the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of real
property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, the
amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of such
taxable period ending at the end of the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as
though the taxable year of the relevant Company Group Member terminated at the
end of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall make any
such payments at least five (5) days before payment of Taxes is due.

11.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties intend that, for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, the purchase and sale of the Purchased Interests
be treated as a purchase and sale of the assets of the Company Group Members.
The Purchase Price, plus any other amounts required to be treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, shall be allocated among
the assets of the Company Group Members in a manner consistent with Section
1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a schedule setting
forth Buyers proposed allocation (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Seller shall have thirty (30) days to
review the Allocation Schedule and either notify Buyer that it is in
agreement with such Allocation Schedule or deliver, in writing, any objections
that it may have with respect thereto. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any disputes concerning the Allocation Schedule. If any
dispute regarding the Allocation Schedule remains unresolved after sixty (60)
days following Sellers delivery of comments on such Allocation Schedule to
Buyer, then each of Buyer and Seller shall make its own determination as to
the allocation contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_. If Buyer and Seller
reach agreement on a final Allocation Schedule, Buyer and Seller shall file
all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the
final Allocation Schedule and neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position
(whether on audit, on Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with
such Allocation Schedule; provided that nothing contained herein shall
prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Entity based upon or arising out of such Allocation Schedule,
and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity
challenging such Allocation Schedule.

11.3 _Post-Closing Actions_. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer will
make, revoke or modify any Tax election with effect on or prior to the Closing
Date, change any method of Tax accounting with respect to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or amend any Tax Return in respect of
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, in each case, in a
manner that reasonably would be expected to adversely affect Seller or the
Seller Affiliates.

 

11.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer will be responsible for one hundred percent
(100%) of Transfer Taxes and shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all related Tax Returns. Seller and Buyer will reasonably cooperate
in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the
amount of any such Taxes.

 



51

    

11.5 _Tax Refunds_. If any Company Group Member receives a credit for or
refund of Taxes related to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or
before the Closing Date that were (i) not included in the determination of Net
Working Capital or (ii) otherwise paid or borne by Seller, Buyer shall
forward, and shall cause any Company Group Member to forward, to Seller the
amount of such credit or refund, net of Buyers reasonable expenses incurred
to obtain such credit or refund, within ten (10) days after such credit or
refund is received.

 

ARTICLE 12

SURVIVAL; WAIVERS; LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY

12.1 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates, and each of their respective members, owners, directors,
officers, employees, managers, agents, representatives, consultants and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, from and against (any of the Losses described in
this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_, a " _Buyer Indemnification Claim_ "):

(i) any Losses incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of
the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement and in
the certificate of Seller delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)_; 

(ii) any Losses incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of
the covenants or agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement; and

(iii) any Seller Taxes.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates, and each of their respective members, owners, directors,
officers, employees, managers, agents, representatives, consultants and
permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ " and together
with the Buyer Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ "), to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, from and against (any of the Losses described in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(b)_, a " _Seller Indemnification Claim_ "):

 

(i) any Losses incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of
the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement and in
the certificate of Buyer delivered to Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(a)(i)_; and

 

(ii) any Losses incurred, arising out of or relating to any breach of any of
the covenants or agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

 



52

    

12.2 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Article 12_ , the following terms shall apply to any claim
for monetary damages arising out of this Agreement or related to the
transactions contemplated hereby:

 

(a) _Deductible and Cap_. Seller will not have any liability under _Section_
__ _ 12.1(a)(i)_ (other than for breach of any Fundamental Representation of
Seller or a representation or warranty contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.11_) in
respect of any individual claim or series of related claims involving Losses
of less than $50,000 (each individual claim or series of related claims that
equals or exceeds such threshold being a " _Qualifying Claim_ ") unless and
until the aggregate amount of all Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees arising in
respect of Qualifying Claims exceeds $8,902,500 (the " _Deductible_ "), at
which time Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for the full amount of
all such Losses in respect of Qualifying Claims in excess of $5,000,000 up to
an amount not to exceed $118,700,000 (the " _Cap_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, Qualifying Claims, the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply with
respect to any Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to breaches
of the Fundamental Representations of Seller nor any representation or
warranty contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, and none of such Losses shall
count towards the satisfaction of the Deductible or the Cap. In no event shall
the aggregate amount of all payments made by either Party in satisfaction of
claims for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Purchase
Price.

(b) _Survival_.

 

(i) Each of the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in
this Agreement, in the certificate of Seller delivered to Buyer pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ or in the certificate of Buyer delivered to Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)(i)_ (other than the Fundamental
Representations of Seller and any representation or warranty contained
_Section_ __ _ 4.11_) including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations and warranties, shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the twelve
(12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date.

(ii) Each of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
_Section_ __ _ 4.11_, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations and warranties, and each of the covenants and other agreements
set forth in _Article 11_ shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the thirtieth
(30th) day after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extensions thereto to the extent that such statute
of limitations may be tolled).

(iii) Each of the Fundamental Representations of Seller contained in this
Agreement or in the certificate of Seller delivered to Buyer pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations and warranties, shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect indefinitely.

 

(iv) The covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement or any other
instrument or certificate delivered hereunder, including any rights arising
out of any breach of such covenants, that do not by their terms require
performance in whole or in part after the Closing shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement until the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the
Closing Date.

 



53

    

(v) The covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement or any
other instrument or certificate delivered hereunder, including any rights
arising out of any breach of such covenants, that by their terms require
performance in whole or in part after the Closing shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement until fully discharged.

Each applicable survival period as determined in accordance with the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) is herein referred to as an "
_Expiration Date_."

(c) _Claims Period_. No action for a breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein shall be brought after the applicable Expiration
Date, except for claims of which a Party has received a Claim Notice, setting
forth in reasonable detail the claimed misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant, prior to the applicable Expiration Date. The Parties
agree that so long as written notice is given on or prior to the Expiration
Date with respect to such claim, the representations and warranties with
respect to such breach shall continue to survive until such matter is finally
resolved.

(d) _Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness; No
Duplicate Recovery_. Buyer may not make any claim for indemnification under
this _Article 12_ in respect of any matter to the extent that such Loss or
liability is otherwise included in the Adjustment Amount through Closing Net
Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness. Buyer shall not be entitled to
duplicate recovery of Losses arising from the same facts, circumstances,
occurrences or non-occurrences.

 

12.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. Each Indemnitee agrees that promptly after
it becomes aware of a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 12_ , such Indemnitee must assert its claim for indemnification under
this _Article 12_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") by providing a written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") to the party allegedly required to provide indemnification
protection under this _Article 12_ (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying,
in reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such Claim, including the
underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged to have
been breached and the amount of any Loss (if known and quantifiable).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnitees failure to send or delay in
sending a third-party Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from liability hereunder with respect to such Claim except to the extent
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure or delay. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnitee in writing within thirty (30) days from
its receipt of the Claim Notice that it disputes such claim, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to indemnify
the Indemnitee from and against the entirety of any Losses described in such
claim. If an Indemnifying Party has delivered an indemnity dispute notice to
such Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnitee shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the Indemnifying
Party and such Indemnitee cannot resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the indemnity dispute notice, such dispute shall be resolved
by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 13.7_.

 



54

    

(b) In the event of the assertion of any third-party Claim for which, by the
terms hereof, an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee,
the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its own expense, to assume the
defense of such third-party Claim, including the appointment and selection of
counsel on behalf of the Indemnitee so long as such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense of any such third-party Claim, it shall within thirty (30) days notify
the Indemnitee in writing of its intent to do so. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to settle or compromise or take any corrective or
remediation action with respect to any such Claim by all appropriate
Proceedings, which Proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by
the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee shall be entitled, at its own cost, to
participate with Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such third-party Claim but
fails to diligently prosecute such Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnitee may assume control of
such defense and in the event it is finally determined by a court or
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction that the Claim was a matter for
which the Indemnifying Party is required to provide indemnification under the
terms of this _Article 12_ , the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable
costs and expenses of such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, an
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnitee to any criminal liability,
requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnitee or
imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any payment from the
Indemnitee without the Indemnitees prior written consent.

 

12.4 _Calculation of Losses and Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) For all purposes under this _Article 12_ , including, determining whether
there exists any breach or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty by a
Party, and in calculating the amount of any Losses arising out of or relating
therefrom, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers (or
correlative terms) in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded;
provided, however, that this _Section_ __ _ 12.4_ shall not apply in respect
of (i) the first instance of "material" in the last sentence of _Section_ __ _
4.9(a)_, (ii) the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ or (iii) usage of
the terms "Material Contract" or "Material Gathering Contract."

 

(b) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to this _Article 12_ shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns to the extent
permitted by Law.

12.5 _DISCLAIMER_. EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT SET FORTH IN _ARTICLE 4_ , (a)
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER TO BUYER AND HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE, COMMUNICATED, OR FURNISHED (ORALLY
OR IN WRITING) TO BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING ANY OPINION,
INFORMATION, PROJECTION, OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO
BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BY ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF SELLER OR ANY
SELLER AFFILIATE), (b) SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES ANY

13.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure
Schedules, the Exhibits, the documents executed pursuant hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof. There are no restrictions, promises,
representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings between the Parties,

signed by or on behalf of both Parties.

 

(b) Either Party may (i) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement or
(ii) waive compliance by the other Party with any of such other Partys
agreements or the fulfillment of any conditions to its own obligations

shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on
behalf of such Party. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, no
failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The Parties agree that the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 13.3_, _Section_ __ _ 13.4_, _Section_
__ _ 13.7(a)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 13.13_ and the

Buyer shall have the right to assign its rights and delegate its duties under
this Agreement to any of its Affiliates; provided that no such assignment
shall release Buyer from any of its obligations hereunder. Except as expressly
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.4(m)_, _Section_ __ _
7.10 _and _Section_ __ _ 13.12_, nothing in this Agreement is intended to or

_(c)_ and _(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 13.13_ (and any provision of this

13.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. Upon determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

this Agreement pursuant to _Article 10_ , the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b) The right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each Party hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such Party, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in accordance
with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 13.6_. The Party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY MATTER
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY

13.7(c)_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH PARTY TO
THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

(d) EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING ANY ACTION, WHETHER IN LAW
OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY
FINANCE RELATED PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR

13.8 _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing, at the
request of either Party and without further consideration, the other Party

request to consummate more fully and effectively the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

13.9 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in the performance of this
Agreement.

 

13.10 _Disclosure Schedules_. Certain information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes, is not an admission
of liability with respect to the matters covered by the information (including
any violation of law or breach of contract), and may not be required to be
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to create any rights in any third party.
The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. A
matter scheduled as an exception for any representation shall only be deemed
to be an exception to the representation that corresponds numerically to such
Disclosure Schedule, and any other representation for which the relevance of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent.

 



61

    

13.11 _Counterparts; Facsimiles; Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement may
be executed by the Parties in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same

any Party and such signature shall be deemed binding for all purposes hereof,
without delivery of an original signature being thereafter required.

 

13.12 _Independent Legal Counsel; Continuing Representation_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that at all times relevant hereto through the Closing,
Bracewell LLP (" _Bracewell_ ") has represented Seller, the Seller Affiliates

in the Company Group Members (or its ultimate beneficial owners), on the one
hand, and Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company Group Members), on
the other hand, relating in any manner to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein (a " _Dispute_ "), Buyer hereby consents to
Bracewells representation of Seller, the Seller Affiliates and/or any former

between Bracewell, the directors, officers, holders of ownership interests
(and their ultimate beneficial owners), members, and/or the accounting firm
of Seller, any Company Group Member or their respective Affiliates, and all
files, attorney notes, drafts or other documents directly relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby which predate the Closing

as of the Closing Date, such Company Confidential Information may be used on
behalf of Seller, the Seller Affiliates or any former holder of ownership
interests in the Company Group Members (and its ultimate beneficial owners) in

Dispute, Buyer waives the right to present any Bracewell Work Product as

necessary in connection with a Proceeding that is not a Dispute. The Parties

owners), and/or any accounting firm of any of them) prior to the Closing
Date. This _Section_ __ _ 13.12_ is for the benefit of Seller and the Seller
Affiliates and such Persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 13.12_. This _Section_ __ _ 13.12_ shall be irrevocable, and

EXHIBIT B

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered into on
the [ ● ] day of [●], 2019 (the " _Effective Date_ "), by and among
TransCanada Pipeline USA LTD., a Nevada corporation (" _Seller_ "), UGI Energy
Services, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "),
Columbia Midstream Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _CMG_
"), and Columbia Gibraltar Gathering, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Columbia Gibraltar_ ," and together with CMG, the " _Acquired
Entities_ "). Seller, Buyer and the Acquired Entities are sometimes
hereinafter referred to individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the
" _Parties_."

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Columbia Midstream and Minerals Group, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller
Subsidiary_ "), and Buyer have entered into that certain Purchase and Sale
Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2019 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which, among other things, Seller Subsidiary agreed to sell and convey to
Buyer, and Buyer agreed to purchase from Seller Subsidiary, one hundred
percent (100%) of the membership interests of CMG (the " _Purchased
Interests_ ");

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement contemplates and requires the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Parties concurrently with the Closing,
pursuant to which Seller shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the
Acquired Entities, certain transition services described in this
Agreement related to the business operations of the Acquired Entities,
subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, each of Buyer and the Acquired Entities acknowledges that Seller is
not in the business of providing the Services to unaffiliated third parties
but is willing to provide the Services as an accommodation to Buyer and the
Acquired Entities in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein and the Purchase Agreement, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

DEFINITIONS 

All capitalized terms defined in this Agreement have the respective meanings
ascribed to them at the location of their definition. Capitalized terms used
in this Agreement without definition have the meaning ascribed to such terms
in the Purchase Agreement.



   

ARTICLE 2

 

SERVICES

2.1.  _Performance_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller shall provide or cause to be provided to the Acquired
Entities the applicable services described in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Services_
").

 

2.2. _Commencement Date_. Except as set forth in _Exhibit A_ , the provision
of the Services shall begin on the Effective Date.

 

2.3. _Service Standards_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Services shall be performed (a) in a good and workmanlike
manner, (b) as a reasonable and prudent operator, (c) in material compliance
with all applicable Law and (d) with a general degree of care, and in a
manner, that is not materially less than the degree of care and manner with
which such Services were performed by Seller (or a Seller Affiliate) for the
operation of the business of the Acquired Entities immediately prior to the
Effective Date, except solely as such Services differ because of the need to
follow legal corporate formalities or to keep Acquired Entity Data (as
defined below) separate from other data or by virtue of the transition of
responsibility for the Services to Buyer (or its designee).

 

2.4. _Subcontractors and Personnel_.

 

(a) Seller reserves the right, at Sellers sole discretion, to subcontract the
performance of any or all of the Services to another provider, including
third parties and any Seller Affiliate (each, a " _Subcontractor_ "), or to
otherwise cause the performance of any or all Services through any Seller
Affiliate. Seller shall be Buyers and the Acquired Entities sole point of
contact regarding the Services, including with respect to payment. Seller
shall not be relieved of any of its obligations under this Agreement as a
result of the provision of Services by any Seller Affiliate or Subcontractor;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor any Seller Affiliate
(collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") shall be liable for any interruption,
disruption or downtime in the Services caused by acts or inactions of a third
party Subcontractor or any other provider, contractor or other Person outside
the Seller Group. However, in the event of such an interruption, disruption or
downtime due to a third party Subcontractor, Sellers response to such events
shall be generally consistent with its response for its own operations
affected by such event.

(b) Seller or any Seller Affiliate or Subcontractor, as applicable, shall
each have the right, in their own sole discretion, to (i) designate which
personnel they will assign to perform the Services and (ii) remove and replace
such personnel at any time. In performing their respective duties hereunder,
all such personnel shall be under the direction, control and supervision of
Seller, the Seller Affiliates and their respective Subcontractors, as
applicable, and Seller, the Seller Affiliates and their
respective Subcontractors, as applicable, shall have the sole right to
exercise all authority with respect to the employment (including termination
of employment), assignment and compensation of such personnel.

 



2

    

2.5. _Changes to Services_.

 

(a) _Changes Requested by Buyer_.

 

(i) Seller shall not be required to customize Services or Systems (as defined
below) outside of the scope contemplated by _Exhibit A_  for Buyer or any
Acquired Entity (" _Customized Services_ ") except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_. Buyer may, from time to
time, upon at least thirty (30) days prior notice, request that Seller
provide Customized Services. Upon such request, Buyer and Seller shall discuss
in good faith the scope and nature of such request and related issues, it
being understood and agreed that Seller shall not be obligated to agree to
provide any requested Customized Services. If Buyer and Seller mutually agree
on the provision of Customized Services, such request for Customized Services
and such Customized Services will be provided under a written amendment to
_Exhibit A_ executed by Buyer and Seller. Before Seller is required to provide
any Customized Services, Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree on the
applicable Service Fees (as defined below) for any agreed Customized
Services, including any Service Fees required to equitably compensate Seller
for any additional costs it may incur in connection with any changes to the
Services.

 

(ii) Buyer may, in it its sole discretion, terminate or reduce the scope of
any Service on _Exhibit A_ by delivering written notice of such termination
or reduction of the scope of such Service to Seller no later than ten (10)
days prior to the date on which such Service is to be terminated or reduced in
scope.

 

(b) _Changes Required by Applicable Law_. If Customized Services are necessary
in order to comply with applicable Laws or changes to any Contracts or
Permits to which Seller or any Seller Affiliate is party, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing of any impairment on Sellers ability to
provide any Services and provide such Customized Services unless (i)
such Customized Services require a material change to a System or the
implementation of a new System, or (ii) providing such Customized Services is
not practicable for Seller given the then-current characteristics of the
Systems. In such case that Seller is required to provide such Customized
Services, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to amend _Exhibit A_
to revise the Service Fees applicable to such Customized Services; _provided_
, that, Seller shall be obligated to provide the Customized Services during
such negotiation period, subject to the Parties equitably reimbursing the
applicable Party for any under- or over-payment of Services Fees during such
negotiation period as compared to the amended Service Fees, if any, agreed to
in such amendment to _Exhibit A_. If providing such Customized Services is not
required under clause (i) or (ii) above, the applicable Acquired Entity or
Buyer may purchase, at Buyers cost and expense, such services from a third
party. Upon such an event, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
agree upon (A) the activities required to transition the affected Services
from Seller (or a Seller Affiliate or Subcontractor, as applicable) to
such third party, (B) the impact on the remaining Services, (C) the decrease
in Service Fees associated with removing such Services and (D) the Service
Fees for the remaining Services; _provided_ , that, upon termination of
such Services, Buyer shall have no further obligation to pay the Service Fees
for such Services.

2.6. _General Obligations_. Buyer and each of the Acquired Entities shall be
responsible, jointly and severally, for their own acts or omissions and for
those of their Affiliates and their respective Representatives (as defined
below), and for each of their compliance with the obligations of Buyer and
the Acquired Entities under this Agreement. Any breach by any such Affiliates
or Representatives of such obligations under this Agreement shall be

 



3

    

 deemed a breach by Buyer and the Acquired Entities of this Agreement. Buyer
and the Acquired Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, in relation to the Services:

(a) comply with (i) any conditions or requirements imposed on it under this
Agreement in relation to such Services and (ii) the reasonable directions of
Seller as to the use of such Services;

 

(b) not use such Services in breach of any applicable Law;

 

(c) not tamper with or hinder the operation of, or make unauthorized
modifications to, any asset or system of Seller or any Seller Affiliate made
available as part of such Service; and

(d) comply with the terms of any disclosed Contract or Required Consent (as
defined below) with or between Seller or any Seller Affiliate and any third
party or Governmental Entity under which Seller or such Seller Affiliate
provides or causes the provision of such Services.

 

ARTICLE 3

LIMITATIONS 

3.1. _General Limitations_.

 

(a) Seller shall have no obligation under this Agreement to provide services
(i) that are not set forth in _Exhibit A_ , (ii) that are in support of any
business or operations other than the business operations of the Acquired
Entities as conducted immediately prior to the Effective Date, (iii) at a
level of quantity or volume materially in excess of the levels provided by
Seller (or a Seller Affiliate) to the business operations of the Acquired
Entities immediately prior to the Effective Date, or (iv) to any Acquired
Entity if such Acquired Entity ceases to be a direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Buyer. Each of Buyer and the Acquired Entities
acknowledges and agrees that the Services do not include the provision of any
legal, financial, accounting or Tax advice to Buyer, the Acquired Entities or
any of their Affiliates.

 

(b) Seller and the Seller Affiliates shall have no obligation to upgrade,
customize (except to the extent provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_), enhance or otherwise modify any computer hardware,
software, database or network environment, including that which is currently
used in the business operations of the Acquired Entities or otherwise, or to
provide any support or maintenance services for the foregoing items that have
been upgraded, customized, enhanced or otherwise modified by or on behalf of
Buyer, the Acquired Entities or their Affiliates, or to acquire any
additional hardware, software, database, network or other resources during the
Term (as defined below).

(c) In no event shall Seller be obligated under this Agreement to (i) cause
any employee of Seller or any Seller Affiliate to perform Services if such
employee is no longer employed by Seller or any Seller Affiliate; (ii)
maintain the employment of any specific employee; (iii) hire any additional
employees; (iv) take any action in violation of applicable Laws; or (v) take
any action that would constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct;
_provided_ , that the foregoing clause (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not relieve
Seller of its obligations to provide the Services in accordance with this
Agreement.

 



4

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no
obligation to provide or cause the provision of any Services to the extent
the performance of the Services requires a Required Consent that has not been
obtained or may cause Seller or any Seller Affiliate to be in breach of any
software license or any other applicable Contract pursuant to the terms of
such license or Contract.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and the Acquired
Entities shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates or their respective
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) resell, transfer or assign the
Services to, or permit the access to or use of any of the Services by,
any Person other than the Acquired Entities or its Affiliates (except that
third party service providers, in their capacity as agents of the Acquired
Entities, may access the Services solely to enable the Acquired Entities to
receive the Services (and not for the benefit of such third parties),
provided that (A) Buyer provides Seller with notice of such third parties, and
(B) such access shall be subject to compliance with applicable Law, Required
Consents and Sellers (and the Seller Affiliates) agreements with applicable
third parties), or (ii) modify any System or the Services, or permit any third
party engaged by an Acquired Entity, or Buyer, or any of their Affiliates or
their respective Representatives, to modify any System or the Services. For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to provide, or cause the
provision of, the Services for any purpose (or to any Person) other than to
the Acquired Entities for the purpose of operation of the businesses of the
Acquired Entities as conducted immediately prior to the Effective Date.

3.2. _Work Processes, Rules and Procedures_. In connection with the receipt
and use of the Services, Buyer and the Acquired Entities shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, comply with Sellers,
the Seller Affiliates and their Subcontractors, as applicable, then-current
work processes, policies and procedures of which Buyer or the Acquired
Entities have been made aware, and each of Buyer and the Acquired Entities
acknowledges that Sellers, the Seller Affiliates and their Subcontractors,
as applicable, ability to provide the Services is dependent on such compliance
by Buyer, its Affiliates, the Acquired Entities and their respective
Representatives. In addition, Seller shall comply with the reasonable safety,
security and legal restrictions and requirements applicable to an Acquired
Entitys property while on such property.

 

3.3. _Third Party Consents_.

 

(a) Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
Contract, license (including a modification to, extension or renewal of, or
replacement for an existing license), consent or waiver required under such
Partys existing third party Contracts pertaining to any software, equipment,
systems or other materials or associated services required in connection
with performance or receipt of the Services under this Agreement (each, a "
_Required Consent_ "). Each Party shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in obtaining such Required
Consents from third parties. Buyer shall be responsible for paying (or
reimbursing Seller, the Seller Affiliates and their Subcontractors for paying)
any reasonable fee, expense or other consideration required to be paid to a
third party to obtain any Required Consent (a " _Consent Fee_ "); _provided_
, that, upon disclosure of any Consent Fee, Buyer may terminate without cost
the Service that gives rise to the Required Consent.

 



5

    

(b) If, despite using commercially reasonable efforts, a Party is unable to
obtain a Required Consent hereunder, Buyer and Seller shall work together in
good faith to develop a mutually acceptable alternative arrangement that is
sufficient to enable Seller to provide, and the Acquired Entities to receive,
the Services without such Required Consent. Buyer shall bear all reasonable
costs of such alternative arrangement, as applicable. If such alternative
arrangement cannot be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller or is required for a
period longer than thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, any Party
may require that the affected Services be terminated in which case the Service
Fees for Services shall be equitably adjusted to account for such terminated
Services. Seller shall have no obligation to (and no liability for failing
to) perform a Service for which a Required Consent has not been obtained,
unless and until such Required Consent is obtained.

 

(c) Buyer and each Acquired Entity acknowledges and agrees that any Services
provided through or involving third parties or using third party intellectual
property or systems or facilities are subject to the terms and conditions of
any applicable Contracts between Seller, the Seller Affiliates or their
Subcontractors and such third parties, as well as compliance with applicable
Law or injunction, order, restraint or prohibition by a Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction (each, an " _Order_ "). Buyer and each Acquired
Entity shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,
comply with the terms and conditions of any such applicable Contracts and with
applicable Law and Orders in connection with the receipt by Acquired Entities
of the Services.

 

3.4. _Exception to Obligation to Provide Services_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall not be obligated to provide or
cause the provision of any Services if the provision of such Services would
materially impair the use of the Services for the business or operations of
Seller or any Seller Affiliate or violate any Law or Order or violate
any Contract, license or Permit to which Seller or any Seller Affiliate or
Subcontractor is subject. In such event, Buyer and Seller shall discuss the
matter in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to implement, at
Buyers cost and expense, an appropriate workaround to the extent reasonably
practicable.

3.5. _Excuse of Performance_. Sellers delay or failure to perform its
obligations under this Agreement shall be excused (and any rights of Buyer or
the Acquired Entities arising as a consequence of such failure shall not be
exercised by Buyer or the Acquired Entities) if and to the extent
Sellers delay or non-performance is caused by (a) the acts or omissions of
Buyer, any Acquired Entity or a third party acting for or on behalf of Buyer
or any Acquired Entity or (b) the failure of Buyer or any Acquired Entity or
such third party to perform any obligations of Buyer or any Acquired Entity
under this Agreement. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
perform its obligations notwithstanding such failure; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that Buyer and the Acquired Entities work with Seller to remedy the failure
and Buyer shall be responsible for any additional costs reasonably incurred by
Seller or any Seller Affiliate or Subcontractor in connection with
performing the Services as a result of such failure.

 



6

    

3.6. _Buyer and Acquired Entity Acknowledgment and Representation_. Each of
Buyer and the Acquired Entities understands that the Services provided
hereunder are transitional in nature and are furnished by Seller solely for
the purpose of accommodating the transfer of the Purchased Interests from
Seller to Buyer. The Parties have allocated responsibilities and risk of
Losses (as defined below), and limited the liabilities of Seller and the
Seller Affiliates as stated in this Agreement based on the recognition that
Seller and the Seller Affiliates are not in the business of providing the
Services to third parties. Such provisions are fundamental elements of the
basis of the bargain between Seller and Buyer. During the Term, Buyer and the
Acquired Entities each shall (i) make a transition to its own
internal organization or other third party suppliers for the Services, and
(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cease using the Services as
soon as commercially practicable after the Effective Date, but in no event
later than the end of the applicable "Service Period" set forth in _Exhibit
A_.

ARTICLE 4

 

SECURITY

4.1.  _Seller_ __ _s Facilities_. Seller may perform, or cause to be
performed, the Services in such facilities as Seller reasonably deems
appropriate. While at such facilities, Buyer and each Acquired Entity shall,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to, comply with Sellers,
the Seller Affiliates and their Subcontractors or other third party
providers, as applicable, safety and security requirements and other relevant
policies of which Buyer or the applicable Acquired Entity personnel have been
given notice from time to time.

4.2. _Security Level; Additional Security Measures_. Seller or any Seller
Affiliate may, from time to time, implement such new information security
measures with respect to the Services as Seller or such Seller Affiliate, in
their sole discretion, deem necessary or appropriate, including measures that
may (a) affect the manner in which the Services are provided or (b) address
new security-related issues, including compliance with applicable Laws related
to security and issues in connection with new technologies or threats. Buyer
and the Acquired Entities shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, provide, all assistance reasonably requested by Seller or
such Seller Affiliate in connection with such security measures; _provided_ ,
that Buyer shall not be required to incur any additional costs or pay any
increased Services Fees.

 

4.3. _Access to Systems._ Buyer and the Acquired Entities shall, and shall
cause all personnel who have access to any systems of Seller or any Seller
Affiliate or their respective Subcontractors or third parties (" _Systems_ ")
to, limit their access to those portions of the Systems for which they are
authorized in connection with their receipt or use of the Services. Buyer and
the Acquired Entities shall (a) limit such access to those personnel who are
designated by Buyer or an Acquired Entity and who are authorized by Seller in
accordance with Sellers or the Seller Affiliates usual authorization
procedures to use the Services and the applicable Systems, (b) upon Sellers
request, provide to Seller a written list of the names of all of the personnel
who have been granted such access and (c) comply with Sellers (or, as
applicable, the Seller Affiliates, Subcontractors or third parties) then-
current information security rules and procedures (" _IS Procedures_ "). All
user identification numbers and passwords disclosed to Buyer or the Acquired
Entities for access to the Systems shall be deemed to be, and shall be treated
as, Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined below)). If required by Seller, prior to having access to any System,
Buyer and the Acquired Entities shall cause all of their personnel to execute
and deliver to Seller agreements with Seller or otherwise confirm in writing
their agreement to comply with such IS Procedures.

 



7

    

4.4. _Right to Deny Access_. If at any time Seller reasonably believes or
determines that (a) any personnel of Buyer or any Acquired Entity has sought
to violate or circumvent, or has violated or circumvented, applicable Law or
IS Procedures, (b) any unauthorized personnel of Buyer or any Acquired Entity
has accessed any Systems or (c) any personnel of Buyer or any Acquired Entity
poses a material risk to any Systems or has engaged in activities that are
likely to lead to the unauthorized access, use, destruction, alteration or
loss of data, information, or any other form of Loss to Seller or any Seller

SERVICE MANAGERS/DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 

6.1. _Service Managers_. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the Acquired Entities on the other hand, shall each designate a
service manager (that Partys " _Service Manager_ "), who will be directly
responsible for coordinating and managing the delivery or receipt of the
Services and who will have the authority to act on such Partys (and, in the
case of Buyer, the Acquired Entities) behalf with respect to matters relating
to this Agreement. The Service Managers will also discuss progress in the
transition of the Services hereunder and may establish a set of
procedures, including frequency of meetings and reporting, and other
reasonable structures for their cooperation and the cooperation of the Parties
in the execution of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 13.2_, unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer and Seller, all
communications relating to this Agreement and the Services shall be directed
to the Service Managers. With respect to matters relating to the Services
or under this Agreement requiring dispute resolution, the Parties and their
respective Service Managers will follow the dispute resolution process
outlined in this _Article 6_. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand, may, in their sole
discretion, replace their respective Service Manager from time to time with a
substitute manager upon notice to the other Parties.

 

6.2. _Informal Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree that any dispute arising
out of or relating to this Agreement (a " _Dispute_ "), including with
respect to any Services Fees or other amounts owed hereunder, shall be first
submitted for resolution to the Service Managers. If the Service Managers fail
to resolve a Dispute within a reasonable time following its submission to the
Service Managers, but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days, then, at
the request of either Buyer or Seller, such Dispute shall be submitted to a
senior officer of Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) and Seller (or a Seller
Affiliate), and such senior officers shall attempt in good faith to resolve
the Dispute. If such senior officers cannot resolve the Dispute in such manner
within a reasonable time, but in no event more than twenty (20) Business
Days, then any Party may pursue litigation or other available means of
resolving the Dispute. The Parties agree to follow the procedures set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ prior to initiation of any legal proceedings with
respect to any Dispute. The Parties agree that all discussions, negotiations
and other information exchanged between the Parties during the foregoing
escalation proceedings shall be without prejudice to the legal position of a
Party in any subsequent litigation or arbitration proceeding.

7.2. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Ownership of Intellectual Property_. Subject to the nonexclusive license
expressly provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ and the Acquired Entities
rights in Acquired Entity Data pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, nothing in
this Agreement shall grant or transfer any rights, title or interests in
any intellectual property invented or created before, on or after the
Effective Date by or on behalf of Seller or the Seller Affiliates or otherwise
controlled by or licensed to Seller or the Seller Affiliates.

 

(b) _Development of Intellectual Property_. Subject to the Acquired Entities
rights in Acquired Entity Data pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, as between
the Parties, all intellectual property developed or acquired by or for Seller
or any of the Seller Affiliates, whether alone or jointly with any
Representatives of Buyer, or any Acquired Entity or their Affiliates, in
connection with providing the Services shall be owned solely and exclusively
by Seller or such Seller Affiliates.

(c)  _Limited License to Use Seller Work Processes and Software_. To the
extent required for the Acquired Entities to receive the Services, Seller

software owned by Seller that is made available to the Acquired Entities by
Seller solely for the purpose of permitting the Acquired Entities to receive

7.3. _No Implied Licenses_. Except as expressly specified in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant to Buyer, the Acquired

rights, ownership rights or any other intellectual property rights in any
technology, inventions, work processes, hardware, software or any other
tangible or intangible assets owned, controlled or licensed by Seller or the

ARTICLE 8

 

CONFIDENTIALITY

ARTICLE 9

 

FEES AND PAYMENT

9.1.  _Service Fees_. Commencing upon the Effective Date, the fee, rate or
amount to be charged to Buyer for the Services (the " _Service Fees_ ") shall
be as set forth in _Exhibit A_.

 

9.2. _Billing and Payment Terms_. Seller shall invoice Buyer following the end
of each calendar month for (a) the Service Fees, (b) the Consent Fees, (c)
Termination Fees, and (d) reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred during
such calendar month. In addition, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if at any
time the aggregate Service Fees accrued within any month exceeds (i)
$150,000, (ii) $300,000 and (iii) $500,000. Buyer acknowledges that there may
be a lag in the submission of charges from third parties relating to the
provision of the Services. To the extent commercially reasonable, each
invoice delivered by Seller shall provide an itemization of the number of
hours of work performed per the category of "Function" listed in _Exhibit A_
for the applicable calendar month, and the subtotal of the Service Fee for
each such function, provided that such invoicing procedures do not require
any significant customization or modification to existing invoicing
procedures. Buyer shall pay all such invoices within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller in writing. Payments not made in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall bear simple interest at a rate of eight percent
(8%) per annum, computed based on a 365-day year, from and including the date
such payment is due until, but excluding the date of payment.

9.3. _Taxes_. The Service Fees exclude any and all Taxes imposed on the sale
and performance of the Services and any and all Taxes otherwise imposed on,
sustained or incurred with respect to, or applicable to, the Services. Buyer
shall bear any and all use, goods and services and other similar Taxes
imposed on the sale and performance of the Services. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ is not intended to address Taxes to the
extent such Taxes are included in the costs and expenses referred to in
_Exhibit A_ (and thus are already to be paid by Buyer as part of the Service
Fees). Seller shall collect from Buyer and remit any such use, goods and
services and other similar Taxes if required to do so by applicable Law.

ARTICLE 10

 

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS

 

10.1. Except as expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, and subject to

agrees that the Services are provided "AS IS", that Buyer and the Acquired
Entities assume all risks and liabilities arising from or relating to the use
of and reliance upon the Services, and that Seller (on behalf of itself, the
Seller Affiliates and their Subcontractors) makes no representation or
warranty with respect thereto and each of Buyer, the Acquired Entities and
their respective Affiliates acknowledge that it has not relied on any
such representation or warranty. SELLER (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, THE SELLER
AFFILIATES AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS) HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN
REGARD TO QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
REGARDING THE CONDITION, DESIGN

 



12

    

 OR WORKMANSHIP OF THE SERVICES OR THAT THE SERVICES SHALL BE FREE FROM

AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, BUYER AND THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES SHALL BE SOLELY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, AND NOTHING IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY BY SELLER THAT
THE SERVICES COMPLY WITH OR ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ANY OF BUYERS OR ANY
ACQUIRED ENTITYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

Parties_ "), harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, Taxes,
losses, damages, causes of action, fines, penalties, proceedings, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, of whatever

" _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ " and, together with the Seller Indemnified
Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), harmless from and against any and all

that any such Losses were caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller, the Seller Affiliates or any of their Representatives in
providing any of the Services rendered or to be rendered by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement. The foregoing shall constitute Sellers sole and exclusive
monetary liability with respect to the Services or the failure to perform the
Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
and the Acquired Entities hereby waive, and release Seller from any
liability, in contract, tort or otherwise, for all Losses incurred or suffered
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising in connection with this Agreement,
other than any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_.

DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE. Buyer must
notify Seller in writing of any cause of action that may arise under or in
connection with the Services or this Agreement within six (6) months after the
cause of action has accrued, or Buyer and the Acquired Entities shall be
deemed to have waived and/or withdrawn such cause of action.

11.4. The provisions of this _Article 11_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Buyer and the Acquired Entities and Seller with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and no Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any further indemnification,
contribution, recovery or other rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in
respect thereof (whether under this Agreement or under any common law theory
or any Law or otherwise), all of which Buyer and the Acquired Entities (for
themselves and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties) and Seller (for
itself and on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties) hereby waive. Any and
all claims, disputes or demands in any way related to the provision of the
Services, whether undertaken by Seller, any Seller Affiliate or a
Subcontractor providing the Service under this Agreement, shall be made
solely by Buyer or Seller and solely against the other such Party under and
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

11.5. The limitations and disclaimers of Sellers liability in this _Article
11_ shall apply to all Seller Indemnified Parties.

 

11.6. Regardless of any other rights under any other agreements or mandatory

all circumstances, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate and
otherwise minimize their damages and those of their Affiliates, whether direct
or indirect, due to, resulting from or arising in connection with any failure
by the other Parties to comply fully with their obligations under this
Agreement.

accordance with good practice, in a safe and prudent manner and in material
compliance with all applicable Laws, Environmental Laws, rules, regulations
and industry-standard health, safety and environmental policies in relation to
all of such Parties Operations in respect of the Shared Facilities;
provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to impose upon the Acquired
Entities any duty or obligation to clean up, remediate, or otherwise address
any environmental contamination or pollution that may exist upon, under, or
with respect to the Real Property as of the Effective Date, except as set
forth in Section 7.1.

 



5

    

3.2 Each Party agrees to cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with
all reasonable requests of the other Party in relation to Operations in
respect of the Shared Facilities such that parallel activities can be
accommodated, provided that notice has been timely given in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and that such cooperation will not result in cost, other
than _de minimus_ cost, to the other Party.

3.3 Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
other Party with at least thirty (30) days prior notice (sent in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_) of any material Operations outside of the ordinary
course of business by or on behalf of such Party in respect of the Shared
Facilities, which notice shall describe with reasonable detail the nature of
such Partys intended material Operations outside of the ordinary course of
business; _provided_ _that_ , the Parties agree that the failure to give such
thirty (30) days prior notice shall not (i) be the sole basis of any
liability among the Parties or (ii) preclude a Partys ability to use the
Shared Facilities, each as permitted hereby, so long as the other Partys
ability to use the Shared Facilities for its Operations is not unreasonably
impaired.

3.4 Each Party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by
that Party in connection with its own Operations in respect of the Shared
Facilities, including the payment of costs and expenses related to damages,
and in no event shall a Party have any obligation or liability in relation to
the Operations of the other Party.

3.5 The Acquired Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
conduct all routine maintenance and repair of the Shared Facilities in their
current, good operating condition, and shall have the right to bill the TC
Entities for fifty percent (50%) of all costs thereof. The TC Entities shall,
within thirty (30) days of receipt of any such bill, together with reasonable
evidence of the costs incurred, pay to the Acquired Entities the amounts shown
on such bill. If the TC Entities do not timely pay any such bill, the
amounts shown thereon shall accrue interest from the date of delivery of the
bill until the date paid at the lower of (a) eighteen percent (18%) per annum
or (b) the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable Law (the
"Default Rate"). In the event that the Acquired Entities fail to cause the
Shared Facilities to be properly maintained and repaired in accordance with
the this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, then the TC Entities shall have the right
to notify the Acquired Entities of such failure and, if the Acquired Entities
do not cure, or commence and diligently continue activities to cure, such
failure within thirty (30) days of such notice (or at any time in the event of
an emergency), the TC Entities shall have the right to take such action as
may be necessary to cause the Shared Facilities to be maintained and repaired,
and the Acquired Entities shall reimburse the TC Entities for fifty percent
(50%) of such costs, together with interest at the Default Rate until such
payment is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Acquired Entities shall
not make any non-routine or capital modifications or improvements to the
Shared Facilities, nor shall the Acquired Parties construct any future
facilities or other improvements on any part of the Real Property, other than
with respect to Real Property subject to the Ground Lease, without first
obtaining the TC Entities prior written approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, of all plans, specifications,
engineering, estimated costs, and other materials relevant to such proposed
modification or improvement, and in any event, no such modification or
improvement shall unreasonably impair the TC Entities use of or access to the
Shared Facilities for its Operations.

 



6

    

3.6 During the term of this Agreement, the Acquired Entities shall maintain
insurance on the Acquired Facilities and the Shared Facilities, and the TC
Entities shall maintain insurance on all other improvements located on the

improvements. The TC Entities shall reimburse the Acquired Entities for fifty
percent (50%) of the cost of the foregoing insurance with respect to the
Shared Facilities within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the
Acquired Entities therefor. If such amounts are not timely paid, they shall
accrue interest from the date of the invoice until the date paid at the
Default Rate. The TC Entities shall also maintain workers compensation
coverage with respect to their employees, and shall maintain a policy
of commercial general liability insurance on a claims made basis, with
coverages in the aggregate of at least $50,000,000, insuring against liability
for injury and/or death to any person and/or damage to any property occurring
on the Real Property. Each Party may request from time to time, evidence of
insurance from the other Party. If the non-requesting Party fails to provide
such evidence within 10 days of the requesting Partys request,
the requesting Party may procure such insurance on behalf of the responding
party and invoice the responding Party for such amount. If such amounts are
not timely paid, they shall accrue interest from the date of the invoice until
the date paid at the Default Rate.



   4 |

4.1 During the Term, each TC Entity grants to the Acquired Entities and their
employees, agents, representatives, invitees and contractors, a non-exclusive
access easement for purposes of ingress and egress (including by vehicular and
pedestrian traffic) to the Real Property, over, on, across and above and the
surface only of those portions of the Real Property as reasonably necessary
to access the Acquired Facilities or the Shared Facilities, and subject to
such reasonable rules and regulations for the use of the Real Property as the
TC Entities may promulgate from time to time, which rules and regulations
shall be provided to the Acquired Entities in writing prior to their
effectiveness.

4.2 The TC Entities acknowledge and agree that they shall timely maintain or
cause to be maintained Roadways to ensure such Roadways are in a safe and
passable condition, capable of supporting the loads, traffic and equipment
necessary to conduct the Acquired Entities Operations ("Road Maintenance
Standard"). In the event that the TC Entities fail to cause the Roadways to be
properly maintained in accordance with the Road Maintenance Standard, then the
Acquired Entities shall have the right to notify the TC Entities of such
failure and, if the TC Entities do not cure, or commence and diligently
continue activities to cure, such failure within thirty (30) days of such
notice (or at any time in the event of an emergency), the Acquired Entities
shall have the right to take such action as may be necessary to cause the
Roadways to be maintained in accordance with the Road Maintenance Standard,
and the TC Entities shall reimburse the Acquired Entities for such costs in
accordance with Section 4.4 below, together with interest at the Default Rate
until such payment is made.

4.3 The Acquired Entities will be responsible for sharing with the TC
Entities in the cost of Road Maintenance on the Roadways, including related
drainage on or for such Roadways, as more particularly set forth in _Section_
__ _ 4.4_.

 



7

    

4.4 The Parties will coordinate in good faith to measure each Partys
proportionate cost for Road Maintenance of the Roadways based upon each
Partys actual usage of the Roadways (measured through both distance and
frequency of usage). The TC Entity performing any Road Maintenance (or
receiving a request for contribution from a third party that has performed
such Road Maintenance) shall invoice the Acquired Entities for the Acquired
Entities proportionate share of cost, which invoice shall include reasonable
supporting detail, within 60 days of the completion of the work (or receipt
of a request for contribution, as applicable), and the Acquired Entities shall
pay such invoice within 30 days of receipt thereof; provided, however, that if
any Road Maintenance shall become necessary due to the negligence
or misconduct of any Party, the other Party shall have no obligation to bear
any cost or expense related to such Road Maintenance, all the costs of which
shall be promptly paid by the Party causing the need for such Road
Maintenance.

written waiver thereof, signed by the Person entitled to notice, whether
before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the
giving of such notice.

8.2 _Entire Agreement. _ This Agreement, together with the schedules and
exhibits hereto and the Purchase Agreement, together with the Exhibits and the
other documents executed pursuant thereto, constitutes the entire agreement
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the

promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than those expressly
set forth or referred to herein. In the event of any conflict between the

(a) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each Party.

 

(b) Each Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, (i) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other Party
contained herein or (ii) waive compliance by any other Party with any of such
other Partys agreements or the fulfillment of any conditions to its own
obligations contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by such Party. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, no
failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

8.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment; No Third Party Benefit_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors
and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder may otherwise be assigned by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except in connection
with (a) with respect to the TC Entities, a sale, transfer or mortgage of the
Real Property, and (b) with respect to the Acquired Entities, in connection
with an assignment of the Ground Lease or a sale of the Acquired Facilities,
in each case such transferring Party shall provide notice to the other Party
and cause the transferee to assume on obligations in this Agreement. Except as
expressly provided in _Article 6_ , nothing in this Agreement is intended to
or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties, and their successors
and assigns, any rights, benefits, or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 

8.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, and in all other respects this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. Upon determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

8.6 _Governing Law; Consent To Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS
CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES OR PRINCIPLES.

(b) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES

IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE OR PROCEEDING
SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY

TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BROUGHT IN
SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH
DISPUTE. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE MAY BE
ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER
PROVIDED BY LAW.

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY MATTER
WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 8.6(c)_ WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

 

8.7 _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Effective Date, at
the request of any Party and without further consideration, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to such requesting Party such instruments and
documents and take such other action (but without incurring any material

consummate more fully and effectively the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.8 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in the performance of this
Agreement.

8.9 _Counterparts; Facsimiles; Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement may be
executed by the Parties in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
agreement. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or other electronic
transmission (including scanned documents delivered by email) signatures by
any Party and such signature shall be deemed binding for all purposes hereof,
without delivery of an original signature being thereafter required.

 

8.10 _Covenant Running with Land_. The Parties intend the terms and provisions
set forth in this Agreement to be covenants running with the land. Any Party
may file memoranda of this Agreement in local land records, substantially in
the form shown in _Exhibit_ __ _ D_, and each Party agrees to promptly enter
into and execute any such memoranda and cooperate with such Party in all
reasonable respects in filing them. __

this Agreement are not intended to create, a partnership, joint venture, or
tax partnership.

 



13

    

8.12 _Estoppel Certificates_. Within ten (10) business days following the
receipt of the written request of the other Party, each Party shall execute
