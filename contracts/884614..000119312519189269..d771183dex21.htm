Contracts or Permits to which Seller or any Seller Affiliate is party, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of any impairment on Seller&#146;s ability to provide any Services and provide such Customized Services unless (i)&nbsp;such
Customized Services require a material change to a System or the implementation of a new System, or (ii)&nbsp;providing such Customized Services is not practicable for Seller given the then-current characteristics of the Systems. In such case that
Seller is required to provide such Customized Services, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to amend <U>Exhibit A</U> to revise the Service Fees applicable to such Customized Services; <U>provided</U>, that, Seller shall be obligated to
provide the Customized Services during such negotiation period, subject to the Parties equitably reimbursing the applicable Party for any under- or over-payment of Services Fees during such negotiation period as compared to the amended Service Fees,

third party, (B)&nbsp;the impact on the remaining Services, (C)&nbsp;the decrease in Service Fees associated with removing such Services and (D)&nbsp;the Service Fees for the remaining Services; <U>provided</U>, that, upon termination of such
