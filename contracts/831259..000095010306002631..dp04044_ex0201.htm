ARTICLE 2 
  THE MERGER

 

 Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with New York Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the  "Surviving Corporation"). 

 

 (b) Promptly after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the New York  Department of State and make all other filings or recordings required by New York Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the New York Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

 

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and purposes and shall assume and be liable for all of the liabilities,  obligations and penalties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under New York Law.

 

 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time,

 

 (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.67 shares of  Parent Stock (together with the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock as specified below, the "Parent Stock Consideration"), and (ii) an amount in cash equal to  $88.00, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"). The Parent Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be referred to collectively herein as the  "Merger Consideration";

 

 (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;  and

 

 (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with  the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

10    
  
 

 Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company  (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make available to the  Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of  Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the  Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree.

 

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a  Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the  case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at  Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may  be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall  be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall  pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax  has been paid or is not payable.

 

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the  Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 

11    
  
 

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six months after the  Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for  payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock  for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately  prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person  previously entitled thereto.

 

 (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section  2.06, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section.  Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the securities of Parent have been registered, at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional  shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.06 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such  securities.

 

 Section 2.04 _. Stock Options._ (a) Except as provided in Section 2.04(b), the terms of each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company  Stock under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be adjusted as  necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute a fully vested option (each, an "Adjusted  Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions, other than vesting, as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares  of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Stock Option Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per share of Parent Stock  subject to any such Adjusted Option (the "Adjusted Option Exercise Price") will be an amount (rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of a cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the  exercise price per share of Company Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the Stock Option

 

12    
  
 

Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that the exercise price otherwise determined shall
be increased to the extent, if any, required to ensure that the In The Money
Amount of the  Adjusted Option immediately after the adjustment is equal to
the In The Money Amount of the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price of,
and number of shares subject to,  (i) each Adjusted Option shall be
determined as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and (ii) (x)
any fractional share of Parent Stock resulting from an aggregation of all the
shares of a holder subject to any Company Stock Option  shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole share and (y) for any Company Stock Option to which
Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under any of
Sections 422 through 424 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares 
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the
Code.

 

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary consents from holders of options to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the  Companys stock option or compensation plans or arrangements and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section  2.04.

 

 (c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.04, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock, as  is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed  under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Company Stock Options and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable following  the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such Company Stock Options (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Company Stock Options remain  outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to administer  the Company Stock Options assumed pursuant to this Section 2.04 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to the extent the Company Stock Options complied with such rule prior to the Merger.

 

 Section 2.05 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding  shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such  period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of options 

 

13    
  
 

outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company Stock granted
under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this 
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

 Section 2.06 _. Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock  that a holder of shares of Company Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an  amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a share of Parent Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the fraction of a share of Parent Stock to  which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

 

 Section 2.07 _. Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the  consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the  Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which the Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

 Section 2.08 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact  by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any  claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented  by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

 

ARTICLE 3

 (g) Each No-Shop Party acknowledges and agrees that, during the three Business Day period referred to in Section 8.06(f)(iii), the other No-Shop Party shall have the opportunity, but not the  obligation, to propose to amend the terms of this Agreement. Such No-Shop Partys Board of Directors will review any proposal by the other No-Shop Party to amend the terms of this Agreement in order to determine, in good faith in the exercise  of its fiduciary duties, whether such proposal would result in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal compared to this Agreement, including such proposed amendments.

 

 (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a No-Shop Partys Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

 (i) Each No-Shop Party acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this  Section 8.06.

 

62    
  
 

 (j) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a No-Shop Partys Board of Directors from making a Change of Recommendation in respect of any event, development, circumstance or state of affairs  occurring after the date hereof but prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting or Parent Stockholder Meeting, as the case may be, if such Board of Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to  take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

 

 (k) When used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 

 

 "Acquisition Proposal" means, in respect of either the Company or Parent, (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business  combination, amalgamation, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or winding-up in respect of such party; (ii) any sale or acquisition of 20% or more of the fair market value of the assets of such party on a consolidated basis; (iii) any sale  or acquisition of 20% or more of such partys shares of any class or rights or interests therein or thereto; (iv) any sale of any material interest in any material mineral properties; (v) any similar business combination or transaction, of or  involving such party or any material Subsidiary, other than with the other party; or (vi) any proposal or offer to, or public announcement of an intention to do, any of the foregoing from any Person other than the other party; _provided_ that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal  made by a Third Party to the Company or Parent in writing after the date hereof: (i) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, by means of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, amalgamation, consolidation,  recapitalization, liquidation, winding-up or similar transaction, all of the Company Stock (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal of which the Company is the subject) or the Parent Stock (in the case of an Acquisition Proposal of which Parent is  the subject); (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory (including antitrust and competition approvals) and other aspects of such proposal and the Third Party making such proposal; (iii)  in respect of which any required financing to complete such Acquisition Proposal has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the party that is the subject of such Acquisition Proposal, acting in good faith (after receipt of advice from its  financial advisors and outside legal counsel), is reasonably likely to be obtained, (iv) that is not subject to any due diligence condition; and (v) in respect of which the Board of Directors of the party that is the subject of such Acquisition  Proposal determines in good faith (after receipt of advice from its financial advisors with respect to (y) below and outside legal counsel with respect to (x) below) that (x) failure to recommend such Acquisition Proposal to such partys  stockholders would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and (y) such Acquisition Proposal taking into account all of the terms and conditions thereof, if consummated in accordance with its terms (but not assuming away any 

 

63    
  
 

risk of non-completion), would result in a transaction more favorable to such
partys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any amendment of this Agreement 
proposed by the other party pursuant to Section 8.06(g)), and taking into
account the long-term value and synergies anticipated to be realized as a
result of the combination of the Company and Parent.

 

 Section 8.07 _. Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before, directly or through any representatives,  issuing any press release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or  the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release, have any such communication, make  any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such consultation.

 Section 8.09 _. Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality  Agreement, the Company and Parent shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (i) give to the other party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties, books and  records of such party (but in no event shall such access include the right to perform physical examinations and to take samples of the soil, ground water, air, products or other areas as desired by such other party), (ii) furnish to the other party,  its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and  other authorized representatives to cooperate with the other party in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 8.09 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other  party. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this

 

64    
  
 

Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by any party hereunder.

 

 Section 8.10 _. Notices of Certain Events._ Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of:

 (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 (c) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in Article 9 of  this Agreement not to be satisfied; and

 

 (d) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition  set forth in Article 9 of this Agreement not to be satisfied;

 

_provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.10 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving that notice.

 Section 8.12 _. Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any  dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article 2 of  this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Company and will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3  promulgated under the 1934 Act.
