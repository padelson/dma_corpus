RECITALS

WHEREAS, on April 23, 2017, Seller entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Bard Merger Agreement") with C. R. Bard, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation ("Bard"), and Lambda Corp., a New Jersey corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Seller ("Lambda"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Bard Merger Agreement, Lambda will
merge with and into Bard, with Bard surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Seller (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, Seller, those Subsidiaries of Seller set forth on Schedule I hereto
and those Entities that will become Subsidiaries of Seller upon the Lambda
Closing set forth on Schedule I hereto (collectively, the "Seller
Subsidiaries;" the Seller Subsidiaries collectively with Seller, the "Seller
Entities") are engaged in, among other things, the Rhodes Product Line and the
Corfu Product Line (together, the "Product Lines");

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to, or cause the Seller Subsidiaries to sell
to, Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase from the Seller Entities, the
Purchased Assets, on the terms and conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") is expected to
issue an Order in connection with its review of the Merger (such Order, the
"FTC Order") and the European Commission (the "EC") is expected to issue the
commitments submitted by Seller and Bard under Article 6(2) of the Council
Regulation (EC) 139/2004 (the "EC Commitments") and to adopt a decision in
Case M.8523 (the "EC Decision") in connection with its review of the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and promises contained herein, the
adequacy and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto

1.3 Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Seller Entities and their Affiliates shall retain, and shall be
responsible for paying, performing and discharging when due, and the Purchaser

than with respect to any design defects of any Products sold after the
Closing);



(c) all Liabilities relating to any claim of any third party arising out of

the Seller Entities;

(l) all Liabilities arising under or in connection with any Environmental Law;
and



(m) all obligations of Seller under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement.



1.4 Non-Assignable Assets.



(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Assigned Contract or other Purchased
Asset, including any Governmental Approval identified on Schedule 1.1(e), is
not assignable or transferable (each, a "Non-Assignable Asset") without the
Consent of, or waiver by, a third party or action by a Governmental Authority
(each, an "Assignment Consent"), either as a result of the provisions thereof
or applicable Legal Requirements, and any such Assignment Consent is not
obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement and the related
instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or transfer of such
Non-Assignable Asset, and such Non-Assignable Asset shall not be included in
the Purchased Assets. Instead, without limiting Seller's obligations under
Section 6.5, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all such Assignment Consents after the Closing Date and
after any such Assignment Consents are obtained the Seller Entities shall
assign to Purchaser or its designee such Non-Assignable Assets for no
additional consideration. Following any such assignment, such assets shall be
deemed Purchased Assets for purposes of this Agreement.



(b) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing and subject to payment of
the Purchase Price by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1, Seller shall and
shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries and their Affiliates to (i) cooperate with
Purchaser or its designees in any commercially reasonable arrangement designed
to provide Purchaser or its designee with all of the rights and benefits of
the Non-Assignable Assets after the Closing as if the appropriate Assignment
Consents had been obtained (including enforcement for the benefit of Purchaser
of any and all rights of any Seller Entity or its Affiliates against any other
party arising out of any breach or cancellation of any such Non-Assignable
Assets by such other party and, if requested by Purchaser, acting as an agent
on behalf of Purchaser or as Purchaser shall otherwise reasonably require),
including by granting subleases or other rights and establishing arrangements
whereby Purchaser or its designee shall undertake the obligation to perform
under Assigned Contracts. Seller shall advise Purchaser in writing at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing with respect to any Assigned
Contract or Governmental Approval that Seller knows or has substantial reason
to believe will or may not be assignable or transferable to Purchaser
hereunder at the Closing.



(c) With respect to any Governmental Approval that is a Non-Assignable Asset,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Seller Entities'
liabilities and obligations with respect thereto shall 

cease in all respects as of the date that is two (2) years after the Closing
Date. On and after such date, the Seller Entities shall have no ongoing
liabilities or obligations to Purchaser whatsoever in relation to such
Governmental Approvals or the Products approved, cleared, marketed or sold
under such Governmental Approvals, including any obligation to assist in the
transfer of any such Governmental Approvals. On and after such date, the
Seller Entities shall have the right, exercisable in their sole discretion, to
cease, or cause to cease, the maintenance of such Governmental Approvals in
the applicable issuing countries or territories, and to terminate the same.



1.5 Shared Contracts. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior
to the Closing to cause the counterparty to each Shared Contract to consent to
the partial assignment of those rights of the applicable Seller Subsidiary
under such Shared Contract related to a Product, or to otherwise reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser in Purchaser's efforts to enter into a new contract
with such counterparty on substantially the same terms as exist under such
Shared Contract, in each case as of the Closing; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 1.5 shall require any of the Seller Entities or any of
their Affiliates to pay any fee or other payment, or incur any liability or
out of pocket expense in connection with the efforts set forth in this Section
1.5 (other than any fees and expenses payable to attorneys or other advisors
retained by a Seller Entity in connection with the foregoing). The portion
related to the Products of each such Shared Contract for which the parties
have received consent to such partial assignment shall thereafter be deemed to
be an Assigned Contract hereunder and, if applicable, the Seller Entities
shall wholly assign, or partially assign, such portion to Purchaser as of the
Closing. Any Shared Contract for which the arrangements described in this
Section 1.5 could not be entered into prior to the Closing shall be a Non-
Assignable Asset subject to Section 1.4. The portion related to the Products
of each such Shared Contract for which the parties have not received consent
to such partial assignment shall thereafter be deemed to be an Excluded
Liability.



ARTICLE 2



CONSIDERATION FOR TRANSFER



2.1 Purchase Price and Assumption of Assumed Liabilities.



(a) As full consideration for the sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and
delivery to Purchaser of the Purchased Assets by the Seller Entities,
Purchaser shall (i) deliver to Seller (for the further payment to the Seller
Entities) at the Closing a wire transfer(s) of immediately available funds in
an amount equal to $100,000,000, plus the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Inventory is greater than the Closing Date Inventory Target, minus
the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Inventory Target is greater than
the Estimated Inventory, in the aggregate (collectively, the "Estimated
Purchase Price" and, subject to the adjustment set forth in Section 2.2, the
"Purchase Price") and (ii) assume at the Closing and subsequently, in due
course in accordance with the terms applicable thereto, pay, perform and
discharge the Assumed Liabilities. The Purchase Price shall be paid by wire
transfers of immediately available funds to the wire transfer address of
Seller as provided to Purchaser on or before the second (2nd) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date.



(b) Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a good-faith estimate, calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Protocol, which shall set forth the estimated
amount of Purchased Inventory of the Product Lines (the "Estimated Inventory")
with reasonably detailed supporting documentation, as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern
time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
determined in accordance with the Accounting Protocol. Purchaser shall be
entitled to review and provide comments to Seller on the calculations of the
Estimated Inventory and the components thereof. Seller shall in good faith
consider and discuss with Purchaser any comments that Purchaser makes on such
calculations and may, if Seller, in its reasonable discretion, considers it
appropriate in light of timing, facts and circumstances, re-issue the
Estimated Inventory prior to the Closing, and any such re-issued Estimated
Inventory shall serve as the basis for calculating the Estimated Purchase
Price for purposes of Closing and the provisions of Section 2.2.



2.2 Purchase Price Adjustment; Procedures for Calculating and Paying the
Purchase Price Adjustment.



(a) Purchase Price Adjustment. After the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted by an amount (the "Purchase Price Adjustment") determined in
accordance with this Section 2.2.



(b) Procedures for Calculating and Paying the Purchase Price Adjustment.



(i) Calculation. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date but in no event
later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and shall deliver to Seller, a calculation of
the Purchased Inventory of the Product Lines (the "Closing Inventory") as of
the Closing (the "Closing Date Statement") together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation. The Closing Date Statement 

shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Protocol. If Seller shall
have any objections to the Closing Date Statement, including whether Purchaser
has applied the Accounting Protocol in the preparation of the Closing Date
Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing no later than thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Closing Date Statement, setting forth with
reasonable specificity its objections (the "Objections"). After the end of
such thirty (30) day period, (i) Seller may not amend or introduce any
additional Objections, and any item not so identified will be deemed agreed to
by Seller and will be final and binding upon the parties and (ii) Seller and
Purchaser shall endeavor in good faith, for a period not to exceed twenty-one
(21) days from the date of delivery of such notice of Objections, to resolve
the Objections.



(ii) Dispute Resolution. If at the end of the twenty-one (21) day period there
are any unresolved Objections, Seller and Purchaser shall submit their
respective determinations and calculations and the items remaining in dispute
for resolution (each a "Final Calculation Statement") to one of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Ernst and Young LLP, KPMG International Cooperative
or Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, or their respective Affiliates, to be
mutually agreed by Purchaser and Seller (the "Accounting Mediator"). The
Accounting Mediator will promptly, in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, review only those
items and amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Final
Calculation Statements and resolve the dispute by assigning a value to such
item that is neither greater than the greatest value for such item nor less
than the lowest value for such item claimed in the Final Calculation Statement
of either Seller or Purchaser. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Accounting Mediator shall be limited to (A) those matters that remain in
dispute and that were included in the Final Calculation Statements, (B)
whether, for each calculation of Inventory, such calculation was prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Protocol, and (C) whether there were any errors
in the Final Calculation Statements, and the Accounting Mediator is not to
make any other determination (including the interpretation of any other
provision of this Agreement). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Mediator
will be shared equally by Seller and Purchaser, and the decision of the
Accounting Mediator with respect to the items of the Final Calculation
Statements submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Accounting Mediator and to cause the
Accounting Mediator to resolve any dispute no later than thirty (30) Business
Days after such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Mediator, including
furnishing to each other and to the Accounting Mediator such work papers and
other documents and information relating to the Objections as the Accounting
Mediator may reasonably request and are available to that party (or its
independent public accountants). For purposes of complying with this Section
2.2, Purchaser and Seller will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Accounting Mediator any material related to the Objections and to discuss the
items with the Accounting Mediator.



(iii) Amount. The Purchase Price Adjustment (which may be positive, negative
or zero) shall be calculated as an amount equal to the Closing Inventory minus
the Estimated Inventory. If the Purchase Price Adjustment as finally
determined (whether by agreement of Purchaser and Seller, lapse of time or
resolution of the Objections) is positive, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Purchase Price
Adjustment as finally determined is negative, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an
amount equal to the absolute value of the Purchase Price Adjustment.



(iv) Payment. Payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment, if any, shall be made
by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the wire transfer address of the other party not later than
the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the period for
Objections has expired or, if any Objections are asserted, not later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the procedures for
resolution of the Objections in this Section 2.2 have been completed. The wire
transfer address for such payment shall be designated by Purchaser or Seller,
as the case may be, by notice to the other party on or before the second (2nd)
Business Day prior to the date for payment set forth above.



2.3 Withholding Taxes. Purchaser or any of its designated Affiliates shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (without duplication) from the Purchase Price
or other payments required to be made in accordance with this Agreement, such
amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
Tax or Legal Requirement, as reasonably determined by Purchaser after
reasonable consultation with Seller and after providing Seller with any
supporting documentation reasonably requested by Seller. Each of Purchaser and
Seller shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary or advisable
to reduce or eliminate all such required deduction and withholding.

Product Lines, taken as a whole, and subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.



(d) No Seller Entity is in material default or material breach, and no party
has notified any Seller Entity that it is in material default or material
breach under any Assigned Contract. No event has occurred, and no circumstance
or condition exists, that might (with or without notice or lapse of time) (i)
result in a material violation or material breach of any Assigned Contract or
(ii) give any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of
any Assigned Contract, or to cancel, terminate or modify any Assigned
Contract.



4.10 Insurance. Certain insurance policies currently in force will cease to
provide coverage for the Purchased Assets effective upon Closing. There are no
insurance policies or fidelity bonds that are part of the Purchased Assets or
which will continue to provide insurance for the Purchased Assets subsequent
to the Closing Date.



4.11 Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to Legal Requirements related
to Taxes, Intellectual Property Rights, Trade Control Laws or Anti-Corruption
Laws, which shall be governed exclusively by Sections 4.5 (with respect to
Taxes), 4.6 (with respect to Intellectual Property Rights), 4.16 (with respect
to Trade Control Laws) and 4.17 (with respect to Anti-Corruption Laws), since
June 30, 2014, each Seller Entity, with respect to the Product Lines has
complied with each Legal Requirement and Order that is applicable to it in
connection with any of its properties, assets, operations or business, except
for those failures to comply that have not had, and reasonably would not be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2014, no Seller
Entity, with respect to the Product Lines, has received any written notice
from any third party that such Seller Entity is or may be in material
violation of, or has failed to comply in any material respect with, any Legal
Requirement or Order. There is no material investigation or action pending, or
to Seller's knowledge threatened in writing, by any Governmental Authority
against any Seller Entity with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Product
Lines or the Assumed Liabilities.

resulting from design defects or otherwise, or fails in any material respect
to meet any standards promulgated by any rule or regulation promulgated by any
Regulatory Authority. Seller has no knowledge of any fact or condition related
to any Product that would be reasonably expected to impose upon any Seller
Entity a duty to conduct a Recall with regard to any Product or material
Liabilities for returns or other product liability claims with respect to any
Product, including from any material design defect. The Seller Entities, with
respect to the Product Lines, (i) have obtained all applicable Governmental
Approvals required by any Regulatory Authority to manufacture, market, store,

marketing, distribution or sales activities.

(e) The Seller Entities, and, to the knowledge of Seller, any officer,
employee or agent of the Seller Entities, have not been excluded or threatened

threatened in writing against any Seller Entity or any of their Affiliates

indirectly give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such
Proceeding.

whole.

promptly causes such asset (or the benefits and burdens of such asset) to be
transferred to Purchaser at no additional cost or expense to Purchaser.

the prior approval of the FTC, the EC and any other Governmental Authority and
that Seller is entering into this Agreement to obtain FTC approval for the FTC

Governmental Approvals. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Seller from
complying with the FTC Order, the EC Commitments or the EC Decision and Seller

Purchaser shall not communicate with or make submissions to the FTC, the EC or
any other Governmental Authorities without the simultaneous attendance or
prior written consent of Seller. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any
communication Purchaser or its Affiliates receive from any Governmental
Authority relating to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement
and permit Seller to review in advance any proposed communication by or on
behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority,
unless the staff of such Governmental Authority requires otherwise.



(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)

hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
the other parties hereto and their respective Affiliates, as the case may be,
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions related to
Antitrust Laws; provided, that Seller shall not be entitled to review or have
access to Purchaser's business plan or Purchaser's other competitively
sensitive information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.4(c), Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be able to consult
with the FTC, the EC or any other Governmental Authorities pursuant to Legal
Requirements or otherwise if the staff of such Governmental Authority requests
direct communication with or submissions from Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates without prior written consent of, notification to or attendance of
Seller.



(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of Purchaser
contained in this Section 6.4, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental
Authority with respect to Antitrust Laws in any jurisdiction in which
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations are required under applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate the
Transactions. Without limiting any other provision hereof, but subject to
Section 6.4(e), Purchaser shall take any and all actions necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as
to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Drop-Dead Date).



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, Seller shall
not be obligated to, and the use of reasonable best efforts by Seller shall in
no event require Seller or any of its Affiliates to, (i) take, or cause to be
taken, any actions or do, or cause to be done, or assist and cooperate in the
doing of, anything that Seller in its reasonable discretion determines would
contravene any covenant or agreement set forth in the Bard Merger Agreement or
(ii) expand in any material way the nature or scope of the Product Lines or
Purchased Assets or otherwise include within the Purchased Assets any Excluded
Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4,
Purchaser shall not be obligated to, and the use of reasonable best efforts by
Purchaser shall in no event require Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to (x)
pay a higher Purchase Price than the Purchase Price set forth in this
Agreement (as it may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), (y)
enter into any settlement, agreement, or other arrangement with any
Governmental Authority or other third party in connection with this Agreement
or the Transactions, including any settlement, agreement, or other arrangement
to divest, license, or hold or maintain separate assets or properties, if such
action would (1) be reasonably expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the business, assets and liabilities
(contingent or otherwise), taken together, or financial condition of either
Purchaser, taken as a whole, or the Product Lines and Purchased Assets, taken
as a whole or (2) require Purchaser or its Affiliates to divest or sell
Purchaser's assets or properties that (I) do not relate to either (A) home
drainage catheters or (B) soft tissue biopsy and (II) are material to
Purchaser after giving effect to the Transactions.



6.5 Consents. Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.4, on or prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, and agrees to take all commercially reasonable actions that Purchaser

and make and deliver all filings and notices listed on Schedule 6.5(a), and
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, and agrees to take all
reasonable actions that Seller reasonably requests in order to assist Seller
in obtaining all Consents and make and deliver all filings and notices listed

6.6 Notification. Until the Closing, Seller will give prompt notice to
Purchaser once Seller is aware of any of the following: (a) the occurrence, or
non-occurrence, of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would
be reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, (b) any failure to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Seller
under this Agreement and (c) the failure of any condition precedent to
Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement. No notification pursuant to this
Section 6.6 will be deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach
of covenant, or limit or otherwise affect any rights or remedies available to
Purchaser; provided, that no failure by Seller to comply in all material
respects with the provisions of this Section 6.6 with respect to any untrue or
inaccurate representation or warranty shall result in the failure of the
condition set forth in clause (iv) of Section 8.1(a) to be satisfied.



6.7 Unredacted Disclosure Schedules. Seller agrees to provide to Purchaser, a
reasonable time prior to Closing but no later than five (5) days prior to

relating to a business of a Seller Entity or its Affiliates other than the
Product Lines and (z) any property that Purchaser or such Affiliate receives
and that properly belongs to a Seller Entity or any of its Affiliates. The
provisions of this Section 7.1 are not intended to, and shall not be deemed
to, constitute an authorization by a party to permit another party to accept
service of process on its behalf, and no party is or shall be deemed to be the
agent of another party for service of process purposes. After the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause each Seller Entity and its and their respective
Affiliates to, promptly deliver to Purchaser redacted copies of any design
history files that relate partially, but not exclusively, to the Products.



7.2 Return of Assets; Transfer of Purchased Assets



(a) In the event that any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability is discovered
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or identified to Purchaser in writing by
Seller at any time after the Closing Date, possession or ownership of which or
responsibility for which previously has been transferred to, or assumed by,
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions (i)
Purchaser shall return or transfer and convey or assign (without further
consideration) to the appropriate Seller Entity, and Seller shall cause such
Seller Entity to accept or assume, as applicable, such Excluded Asset or
Excluded Liability; (ii) Seller shall cause the appropriate Seller Entity to
assume (without further consideration) any Liabilities associated with such
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities; and (iii) Purchaser shall, and Seller
shall cause the appropriate Seller Entity to, execute such documents or
instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts which are
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer or assignment of such
Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability back to, or assumption of such Excluded
Liability by, such Seller Entity.



(b) In the event that any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability is discovered
by the Seller Entities or any of their Affiliates or identified to Seller in
writing by Purchaser at any time after the Closing Date, possession or
ownership of which has not been transferred to, or assumed by, either
Purchaser or its Affiliates at such time, the Seller Entities shall promptly
take such steps as may be required to transfer or assign, or cause to be
transferred or assigned, such Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities to
Purchaser, subject to Section 1.3 and otherwise in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, at no additional charge to Purchaser or its Affiliates, and
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall accept such Purchased Assets or assume such
Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be.



7.3 Records and Documents. For a period of three (3) years after the Closing,
at the other party's request, each party shall provide the other party and its
Representatives with access to and the right to make copies of those records
and documents related to the Product Lines (possession of which is retained by
a Seller Entity or transferred to Purchaser as applicable), as may be
necessary in connection with any third party litigation, the preparation of
financial statements, any accounting or Tax purposes, or the conduct of any
audit or investigation by a Governmental Authority (excluding claims under
this Agreement in which case the parties shall comply with Article 9 and
Article 11, as applicable, instead of this Section 7.3); provided, however,
that no party shall be required to violate any obligation of confidentiality
to which such party or any of its Affiliates is subject or to waive any
privilege which any of them may possess in discharging its obligations
pursuant to this Section 7.3; provided, further, however, that in any such
case, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the requesting party to implement alternative
arrangements to permit the access contemplated hereby. Thereafter, if it is
proposed to destroy or dispose of any of such books and records, to offer
first in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to such proposed destruction
or disposition to surrender them to the other party at such other party's sole
cost and expense. The foregoing will not require any party to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in its reasonable judgment,
upon the advice of outside counsel, constitutes a Trade Secret or is
reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege. If
at any time after the Closing, any Seller Entity becomes aware that it or any
of its Affiliates has in its or their possession any Books and Records, Seller
shall promptly forward such Books and Records to Purchaser. If, following the
Closing, Purchaser contacts any Seller Entity to inquire as to whether any
specific Books and Records are in the possession of Sellers or their
Affiliates, such Seller Entity and Seller will use their good faith reasonable
efforts to determine whether such Books and Records are in its possession or
the possession of any of their Affiliates and, to the extent such Seller
Entity or Seller locate any such Books and Records, Seller will promptly
forward such Books and Records to Purchaser. 



7.4 Bulk Sales Waiver. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by each Seller
Entity with any applicable bulk sales Legal Requirements in connection with

waiver shall not be deemed to limit, waive, or otherwise modify the

that, without limitation to any other rights or obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, all Confidential Information disclosed in

pursuant to Section 6.2, shall be treated as and remain confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement from the date of
this Agreement until the Closing Date, collectively as "Evaluation Material"
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) at which point the

information which is now or hereafter becomes public other than as a result of
a breach of this Section 7.5, without limitation to any other rights or
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, for a period of three (3)
years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause the Seller
Entities not to, disclose to any other Person any Confidential Information to
the extent used in or relating to the Product Lines, the Purchased Assets,
Purchaser or Purchaser's business, whether in written, oral or other form;
provided that nothing in this Section 7.5 shall in any way limit the
disclosure of any such information to the Representatives of any Seller
Entities in order to assist the Seller Entities with respect to (i) the
conduct of the Seller Entities' businesses other than the Product Lines to the
extent related to the co-ownership of any Confidential Information that
relates to the Product Lines and the Purchased Assets, on the one hand, and
any of the Seller Entities' or any of their Affiliates' other businesses, on
the other hand, and (ii) the Transactions and the Transaction Agreements.



(c) After the Closing, (i) Seller will request the return or destruction
pursuant to the Transaction Confidentiality Agreements of all confidential
information delivered to the counterparties to the Transaction Confidentiality
Agreements and their respective Representatives and (ii) Seller agrees to, and
to cause each Seller Subsidiary and each of its and their applicable
Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its rights
under any such Transaction Confidentiality Agreement for the benefit of
Purchaser, as Purchaser reasonably requests and at the sole cost and expense
of Purchaser.



7.6 Assumption of Regulatory Obligations Relating to Governmental Approvals

. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, from the Closing Date, and except as provided otherwise in any
Transaction Agreement, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for obtaining and
maintaining all Governmental Approvals regarding the Product Lines, as well as
all ongoing regulatory compliance relating thereto (including the reporting of
adverse events).

7.7 Accounts Receivable. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all
Accounts Receivable shall remain the property of the Seller Entities and their
Affiliates and Seller shall, and shall cause the other Seller Entities and its
and their Affiliates to, collect such Accounts Receivable following the
Closing consistent with the normal practice of the Seller Entities and their
Affiliates. If, after the Closing, Seller (or any of its Affiliates), on the
one hand, or Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates), on the other hand, receives
any funds properly belonging to the other party in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the receiving party will promptly so advise such other
party, will promptly, and in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days
after receipt, deliver such funds, together with any interest earned thereon,
to an account or accounts designated in writing by such other party.

7.8 Product Recalls. Subject to the terms of the Transaction Agreements, from
and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the sole right to conduct all
voluntary and involuntary recalls, corrections, market withdrawals, stock
recoveries and other field actions ("Recalls") of Products (whether Products
were sold prior to or after Closing), including Recalls required by any
Governmental Authority and voluntary Recalls of Products. To the extent that
one or more units of Product sold by the Seller Entities or their Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date are subject to a Recall, any Damages or other
Liabilities arising with respect to or related to any Recall with respect to
such units of Product sold by Seller Entities or their Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date shall be Excluded Liabilities. Without limitation of, and subject
to, Purchaser's rights under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement, any Damages
or other Liabilities arising with respect to or related to any Recall of any
units of Product sold on or after the Closing Date (including Products
purchased under the Contract Manufacturing Agreement) shall be Assumed
Liabilities. Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to 

cooperate and assist, and shall cause the other Seller Entities and its and
their respective Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and
assist, Purchaser in implementing and effecting a Recall with respect to
Products.

7.9 Transitional Trademark Rights. It is expressly agreed that Purchaser, as
of Closing, does not have under this Agreement any right, title or interest
(whether express or implied) in, to or under the Seller Transitional
Trademarks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser will have a limited right
to utilize the Seller Transitional Trademarks following the Closing solely in
the manner and solely for the administration of the Product Lines as conducted
immediately prior to the Closing Date, until the later of (i) on a country-by-
country basis, until the number of days after the Closing Date that is set
forth on Schedule 7.9 next to the respective country or (ii) solely with
respect to use on Purchased Inventory or Products (as defined in the Contract
Manufacturing Agreement) manufactured under the Contract Manufacturing
Agreement, the date that such Purchased Inventory or Product (as defined in
the Contract Manufacturing Agreement) is sold (the "Transitional Trademark End
Date"). Following the Transitional Trademark End Date, Purchaser shall
destroy, or remove, strike over, cover over or otherwise eliminate all Seller
Transitional Trademarks from all materials displaying the Seller Transitional
Trademarks in its possession in the respective country, and shall cease using
the Seller Transitional Trademarks and any Trademark confusingly similar
thereto. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Entities and their
Affiliates from and against any and all Damages arising from Purchaser's use
of the Seller Transitional Trademarks.

7.10 Production of Witnesses and Individuals; Privilege Matters

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to
each other, upon reasonable written request, their (and their Affiliates')
respective Representatives for fact finding, consultation and interviews and
as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may be reasonably required in
connection with any Proceedings in which the requesting party may from time to
time be involved relating to the conduct of the Product Lines prior to or
after the Closing. Access to such Persons shall be granted during normal
business hours at a location and in a manner reasonably calculated to minimize
disruption to such Persons or the Product Lines. Seller and Purchaser agree to
reimburse each other for documented and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including documented and reasonable attorneys' fees, but excluding officers'
or other employees' salaries, incurred by the other in connection with
providing Representatives to the other party pursuant to this Section 7.10(a).

(b) From and after the Closing, except to the extent required by Legal
Requirement or Governmental Authority, no party shall intentionally disclose
to any third party, and no party shall permit any of its respective Affiliates
to intentionally disclose to any third party, any documents or other
information that, if disclosed, would cause a waiver of any privilege that can
be asserted under any Legal Requirement by the other party (i) if such waiver
could be reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on the other party or
any of its Affiliates, (ii) with respect to (A) the Product Lines, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Liabilities or (B) the process relating to the sale of the Product Lines.

7.11 Customer Inquiries. After the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify
Purchaser of each inquiry that Seller or any of its Affiliates receives
relating to the Products or the Product Lines from an existing customer of a
Product or Product Line or any other Person that states its desire to explore

ARTICLE 9



TAX MATTERS



9.1 Purchase Price Allocation.



(a) No later than ninety (90) days after the date hereof, Seller shall provide
Purchaser with an allocation of the Purchase Price (plus the Assumed
Liabilities and any other Liabilities deemed assumed by Purchaser for United
States federal income Tax purposes) among the Purchased Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). If Purchaser provides no
comments with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation by written notice to
Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of the Purchase
Price Allocation, then the Purchase Price Allocation shall be deemed final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement and with respect to
any Tax filings made in connection with the actions and transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Purchaser provides any comments with
respect to the Purchase Price Allocation by written notice to Seller within
thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of the Purchase Price Allocation,
and sets forth in such written notice the disputed item or items and the basis
for its objection in reasonable detail, then Seller and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such dispute for a period of fifteen
(15) days thereafter. If, within fifteen (15) days of Seller's receipt of a
valid written notice of objection to the Purchase Price Allocation, Purchaser
and Seller have not reached an agreement regarding the disputed item or items
specified in such written notice, Purchaser and Seller shall submit (at the
expiration of such fifteen (15) day period) all disputed items for resolution
to an Accounting Mediator. The Accounting Mediator shall deliver to Purchaser
and Seller a written determination of any disputed item within twenty (20)
days of submission of the dispute to the Accounting Mediator, which
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Mediator will be shared equally by
Seller and Purchaser.



(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%)
of all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transactions. The applicable Transfer Taxes shall be paid when due by the
party that is required by applicable Law to pay such Transfer Taxes. All Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and timely filed by the party primarily responsible for such filing
under applicable Law, and such party shall provide a copy of such Tax Return
to the other party promptly after it has been timely filed. Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate in filing all necessary documents (including all Tax
Returns and any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes) with respect to all such Transfer Taxes in a
timely manner.



(c) For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by Purchaser under or
pursuant to this Agreement are exclusive of VAT (if any). Accordingly, where
any Taxable supply for VAT purposes is made under or in connection with this
Agreement by a Seller Entity, Purchaser shall, in addition to any payment
required for that supply, pay to the Seller Entity such VAT as is chargeable
in respect of the supply at the same time as payment is due or in any other
case when demanded by the Seller Entity. Where Purchaser belongs to a
different member state of the European Union from the relevant Seller Entity
for the purposes of the supply in respect of which the payment is made,
Purchaser shall provide to the relevant Seller Entity prior to the due date
for payment or the raising of any invoice (whichever is the earlier) details
of the payer's own VAT registration number. The relevant Seller Entity shall
provide Purchaser with a valid VAT invoice in respect of any payment of VAT.
If any payment in respect of VAT to a Seller Entity is made under this
Agreement in circumstances where VAT was not properly chargeable, then, where
the Seller Entity has accounted for such VAT to the relevant Governmental
Authority, the Seller Entities' obligation to repay any amount to Purchaser
shall be limited to such amount as the Seller Entities' are entitled to
recover (by way of credit, repayment or otherwise) from the relevant
Governmental Authority in respect of the VAT wrongly paid.



(d) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audits, examinations or assessments which may materially affect the amount of
any Tax which is, in whole or in part, an Excluded Liability. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 11.4, the Seller Entities shall have the
sole right to control the contest and resolution of any Tax audit,
examination, assessment or other administrative or court proceeding (each and
any of the foregoing, a "Tax Contest") relating to (i) any income Tax matter
relating to the Seller Entities or any of their Affiliates or (ii) any Tax
which is, in whole or in part, an Excluded Liability, and in each case to
employ counsel of its choice at its expense, provided that, if the resolution
of such Tax Contest could be reasonably expected to increase the Tax liability
of, or reduce any Tax benefit available to, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
for 

any Post-Closing Tax Period, Sellers shall not settle, discharge, compromise,
or otherwise dispose of such Tax Contest without obtaining the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates may settle
any Tax Claim relating, in whole or in part, to any Tax which is an Excluded
Liability without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be
withheld in the sole discretion of Seller.



(e) After the Closing, each of Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall
furnish, and cause their respective Affiliates to furnish, to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating
to the Purchased Assets as is reasonably necessary for the preparation or
filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit by or dispute with any Tax Authority and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax
Return. Each of Purchaser and the Seller Entities shall provide, or cause
their respective Affiliates to provide, timely notice to each other in writing
of any pending or threatened Tax audit, examination, assessment or other
administrative or court proceeding with respect to the Purchased Assets for
any Taxable period for which the other party may have Liability under this
Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, or shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, furnish to each other copies of all correspondence received
from any Tax Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any Taxable period for which the other party or its Affiliates
may have Liability under this Agreement.



(f) Purchaser and Seller agree, upon the reasonable request of the other
party, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from each other, any Governmental Authority or any other Person
(including applicable "sale or resale" certificates) as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with
the Transactions.



ARTICLE 10



TERMINATION



10.1 Circumstances for Termination.



At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated by written
notice explaining the reason for such termination:



(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;



(b) by either Purchaser or Seller, if (i) the non-terminating party is in
material breach of this Agreement and such breach shall not have been cured
within thirty (30) days of receipt by such party of written notice from the
terminating party of such breach and (ii) the terminating party is not, on the
date of termination, in material breach of this Agreement;



(c) by Seller, if Seller reasonably determines in good faith and based on
correspondence, discussions, or communications by either party with the FTC,
the EC, or any other Governmental Authority and after consultation with
Purchaser that (i) FTC staff, the EC, or any other relevant Governmental
Authority will not recommend approval of Purchaser as the purchaser of the
Purchased Assets hereunder thereby limiting the ability of the parties to
obtain any approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations identified in Section 8.3(b), (ii) this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement must be amended beyond those parameters to which Seller
and Purchaser have agreed in order to receive approval from the FTC, the EC,
or any other Governmental Authority under Section 8.3(b) or (iii) this
Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby are not acceptable to the FTC, the EC, or any other Governmental
Authority as required under Section 8.3(b), and despite the parties'
compliance with their respective obligations as set forth herein, negotiations
with the FTC, the EC or any other Governmental Authority as required under
Section 8.3(b) have terminated without a mutually acceptable resolution;



(d) by either Seller or Purchaser, if (i) the Closing has not occurred on or
prior to April 23, 2018 (the "Drop-Dead Date") for any reason and (ii) the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement hereunder has not caused (including
through a misrepresentation, any action or inaction) such failure to close; or



(e) by either Seller or Purchaser if any Governmental Authority has issued a
final, non-appealable Order (other than a temporary restraining order), or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Transactions.



10.2 Effect of Termination.



(a) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.1, all
obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except for the
obligations set forth in this Article 10 (Termination) and Sections 7.5
(Confidentiality), 12.1 (Expenses), 12.6 (Governing Law) and 12.7
(Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial); provided, however, that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability resulting from any willful and material
breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 10.2, a "willful and
material breach of this Agreement" shall mean a deliberate action or omission
(including a failure to cure circumstances) where the breaching party knows
such action or omission is or would be reasonably expected to result in, or
intends such action or omission to be or reasonably expects such action or
omission to, result in a breach of this Agreement.



(b) Seller shall reimburse the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.1(a) because the Bard Merger Agreement has been terminated; provided,
however, Seller shall not reimburse Purchaser for any costs in excess of
$2,000,000.



ARTICLE 11

Article 11, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and

Affiliates (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Persons") from and
against any and all Damages, including documented and reasonable attorneys'
fees (collectively, "Purchaser Damages"), arising out of, relating to or
resulting from (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty
of any Seller Entity contained in this Agreement; (b) any breach of a covenant
of a Seller Entity contained in this Agreement; or (c) any Excluded Liability.



11.2 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article 11, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Seller Entities and their respective officers,
directors, agents, employees and Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Damages, including
documented and reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively, "Seller Damages"),
arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) any breach of or inaccuracy
in a representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (b)
any breach of a covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (c) any
Assumed Liability; or (d) any liability for Taxes resulting from transactions
or actions taken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.



11.3 Time for Claims. No claim may be made or suit instituted seeking
indemnification pursuant to Sections 11.1(a) or 11.2(a) unless a written
notice describing such claim in reasonable detail in light of the
circumstances then known to the Indemnitee is provided to the Indemnitor prior
to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that (i) claims may be made with respect to the representations and warranties
relating to Taxes set forth in Section 4.5 (Taxes) until thirty (30) days
after expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations relating to such
Taxes, (ii) claims may be made with respect to the Seller's Fundamental
Representations, the Seller's representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.6(a) and the Purchaser's representations and warranties in Sections
5.1, 5.2 and 5.6 (collectively, the "Purchaser's Fundamental Representations")
at any time after Closing.



11.4 Procedures for Indemnification.



(a) Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to indemnification under
Sections 11.1 or 11.2 or any other provision of this Agreement (the
"Indemnitee") of written notice of the assertion or the commencement of any
Proceeding with respect to any matter referred to in Sections 11.1 or 11.2 or
in any other applicable provision of this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall give
written notice describing such claim or Proceeding in reasonable detail in
light of the circumstances then known to the Indemnitee to the party obligated
to indemnify the Indemnitee (the "Indemnitor"), and thereafter shall keep the
Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto; provided, however, that
failure of the Indemnitee to keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed as
provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby. If any
Proceeding shall be commenced against any Indemnitee by a third party, the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and assume the
defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, at the
Indemnitor's sole expense; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall not
have the right to assume or control the defense of any Proceeding if at any
time (i) the Indemnitee shall have one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to
the Indemnitor, and, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee, counsel for
the Indemnitor could not adequately represent the interests of the Indemnitee
because such interests could be in conflict with those of the Indemnitor; (ii)
such litigation is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on any
other matter beyond the scope or limits of the indemnification obligation of
the Indemnitor; (iii) the claim involves any criminal proceeding against an
Indemnitee, (iv) the claim seeks an injunction, equitable relief or other non-
monetary relief against any Indemnitee, (v) where the Indemnitor's
indemnification obligation with respect to such Proceeding is limited by the
Seller's Indemnification Cap or the Purchaser's Indemnification Cap, as
applicable, the amount of Damages alleged in such Proceeding is in excess of
the amount then remaining under the Seller's Indemnification Cap or the
Purchaser's Indemnification Cap, as applicable, at the time the Indemnitee
gives the Indemnitor notice of such Proceeding, after taking into account the
sum of (A) all Damages previously recovered by the Indemnitee hereunder and
counted against the Seller's Indemnification Cap or the Purchaser's
Indemnification Cap, as applicable, plus (B) all Damages specified in any
then-unresolved claims made by the Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 11
which, if paid pursuant to this Article 11, would be counted against the
Seller's Indemnification Cap or the Purchaser's Indemnification Cap, as
applicable, or (vi) the Indemnitor shall not have assumed the defense of the
Proceeding in a timely fashion (but in any event within thirty (30) days of
notice of such Proceeding) or, based on the reasonable advice of outside
counsel to the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor is failing to use diligent,
reasonable and good faith efforts to defend such Proceeding.



(b) If the Indemnitor shall assume the defense of any Proceeding, the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in any Proceeding at its expense,
and the Indemnitor shall not settle such Proceeding unless (i) the settlement
shall include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
the plaintiff of a full and unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all
liability with respect to the matters that are subject to such Proceeding, the
settlement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of
any business by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates and the settlement does not
include any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by any Indemnitee or its
Affiliate, or (ii) the settlement otherwise shall have been approved by the
Indemnitee, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Indemnitor shall afford the Indemnitee the opportunity to participate in,
through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Proceeding controlled by the Indemnitor pursuant to Section
11.4(a).



(c) If the Indemnitor fails to notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days
after receipt of notice of such Proceeding pursuant to Section 11.4(a) that
the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of the Proceeding, or to the
extent that the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense or is not entitled
to assume or control the defense in accordance with this Section 11.4, then
the Indemnitee shall have the right to assume and control the defense of the
Proceeding and shall be reimbursed for its documented and reasonable costs and
expenses (including any documented and reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in
connection therewith. In such event, the Indemnitee shall have full control of
such defense; provided, however, that the Indemnitee may not settle such
Proceeding, if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the
Indemnitor's approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.



11.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Person under Section 11.1(a):
(i) unless the aggregate of all Purchaser Damages exceeds $1,000,000 (the
"Seller's Indemnification Deductible"), in which case the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover all Purchaser Damages only to
the extent such Purchaser Damages exceed Seller's Indemnification Deductible
or (ii) to the extent that the aggregate of all Purchaser Damages exceeds
$10,000,000 (the "Seller's Indemnification Cap"); provided, however, that the
Seller's Indemnification Cap and Seller's Indemnification Deductible shall not
apply to nor count towards any Seller indemnification obligation (A) arising
out of, relating to or resulting from Fraud by any Seller Entity or arising
out of, relating to or resulting under Section 11.1(b) or (c), or (B) arising
out of, relating to or resulting from a breach of or inaccuracy in any of
Seller's Fundamental Representations or the Seller's representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.5 and Section 4.6(a). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify
any Purchaser Indemnified Person under this Article 11 with respect to
Purchaser Damages to the extent that the aggregate of all Purchaser 

Damages exceeds the Purchase Price.



(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be
obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Person under Section 11.2(a):
(i) unless the aggregate of all Seller Damages exceeds $1,000,000 (the
"Purchaser's Indemnification Deductible"), in which case Seller Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to recover all Seller Damages only to the extent
such Seller Damages exceed the Purchaser's Indemnification Deductible or (ii)
to the extent that the aggregate of all Seller Damages exceeds $10,000,000
(the "Purchaser's Indemnification Cap"): provided, however, that the
Purchaser's Indemnification Cap and the Purchaser's Indemnification Deductible
shall not apply to nor count towards any Purchaser indemnification obligation
(A) arising out of, relating to or resulting from Fraud by Purchaser or
arising out of, relating to or resulting under Section 11.2(b) or (c), or (B)
arising out of, relating to or resulting from a breach of or inaccuracy in any
of Purchaser's Fundamental Representations. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify any Seller
Indemnified Person under this Article 11 with respect to Seller Damages to the
extent that the aggregate of all Seller Damages exceeds the Purchase Price.



(c) The amount of any Purchaser Damages or Seller Damages shall be net of any
Tax benefit reasonably expected to be realized by the Indemnitee (or its
Affiliates) arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Purchaser
Damages or Seller Damages or any correlative adjustments resulting from such
Purchaser Damages or Seller Damages.



(d) Without prejudice to any obligations arising under a Legal Requirement,
each party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, take all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Damage upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach that gives rise to such Damage.



(e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither party shall
be entitled to recover the amount of any Damages to the extent the amount of
such Damages was included in the calculation of the Purchase Price or the
Purchase Price Adjustment contemplated by Article 2.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any breach of
warranty or inaccuracy of any representation or nonfulfillment, nonperformance
or other breach of any covenant or agreement, and the amount of any Damages
associated therewith, shall be determined without regard for any materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification.



(g) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither party shall
be entitled to claims of breach or indemnification pursuant to this Agreement
(including any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement) more than once with respect to the same breach.



(h) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT AS AWARDED TO A THIRD
PARTY, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR OTHER
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER
CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF, OR
RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF, OR THE FORESEEABILITY OF, SUCH DAMAGES.



11.6 Third Party Contributors and Payment of Indemnifiable Damages.



(a) The amount of any and all Damages for which indemnification is provided
pursuant to this Article 11 shall be net of any amounts actually received by
the Indemnitee with respect to such Damages (i) under insurance policies after
giving effect to any deductible, retention or equivalent loss rated premium
adjustment and any costs or expenses incurred in recovering such insurance
proceeds and (ii) otherwise from any third party (including any Tax Authority)
after giving effect to any deductible, retention or equivalent loss rated
premium adjustment and any costs or expenses incurred in recovering such
insurance proceeds. The Indemnitee shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (x) maintain insurance policies on terms and in amounts reasonable
for a business operating in the Indemnitee's industry and (y) recover under
any applicable insurance policies for any Damages prior to seeking
indemnification under this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall require any Indemnitee to commence or threaten to commence any
Proceeding in connection with such commercially reasonable efforts.



(b) The amount of indemnification payments to which an Indemnitee shall be
entitled under 

this Article 11 shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the date:
(a) the amount of such payments are determined by written agreement between
the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor; or (b) both such amount and the
Indemnitor's obligation to pay such amount have been determined by a final
Order of any court of competent jurisdiction. The Order of a court shall be
deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article 11 shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from Seller to an account designated by Purchaser, and any
indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article 11
shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
Purchaser to an account designated by Seller.



11.7 Remedies Exclusive. With the exception of the rights of the parties under
Section 12.15 and any claims of Fraud which are proven and upon which a
judgment entered in the involved proceeding shall be expressly based, the
Seller Entities and Purchaser expressly agree that from and after the Closing
the provisions of this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
all claims of breach or indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not limit any rights or remedies and for all
claims pursuant to the other Transaction Agreements.



11.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnification

. For all Tax purposes, Purchaser and Seller agree to treat any indemnity
payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price unless
otherwise required by law.

modified, in whole or in part, except by supplemental agreement or amendment
signed by the parties. Either party may waive compliance by the other party

(a) Any judicial proceeding brought against any of the parties to this

this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement accepts the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment
rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement. The foregoing consents to
jurisdiction shall not constitute general consents to service of process in
the State of Delaware for any purpose except as provided above and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that service of any

role in drafting this Agreement.



12.9 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, as applied to either
party or to any circumstance, is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue in full

negotiate in good faith to replace such illegal, unenforceable or void
provision with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that achieves, to the
greatest lawful extent under this Agreement, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.



12.10 Exhibits and Schedules. All Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto shall
be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and are fully incorporated in this
Agreement by this reference. Disclosure in any Schedule shall qualify (a) the
corresponding Section of this Agreement to which such Schedule refers and (b)
any other Sections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or
applies to such other Sections.



12.11 Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be

internationally recognized overnight courier service, (b) sent by facsimile or

12.12 Rights of Parties. Except for Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Seller
Indemnified Persons, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is
intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement
on any persons other than the parties to it and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, nor is anything in this Agreement intended to relieve
or discharge the Liabilities of any third person to any party to this
Agreement, nor shall any provision give any third person any right of
subrogation or action over or against any party to this Agreement.



12.13 Public Announcements.. Except as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements or stock exchange rules, no party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate or Representative of such party shall make any public announcements
or otherwise communicate with any news media in respect of this Agreement or
the Transactions without the 

prior consent of the other parties, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, and prior to any announcement or communication the parties shall
cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement or
communication.



12.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including facsimile copies thereof or electronic scan copies
thereof delivered by electronic mail, each of which shall be deemed an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument.



12.15 Specific Performance. The parties hereby expressly recognize and
acknowledge that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would result, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine
in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. It is hereby agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof
and immediate injunctive relief and other equitable relief, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the
parties further hereby agree to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of a bond in connection with the obtaining of such injunctive or other
equitable relief. Such remedies, and any and all other remedies provided for
in this Agreement, shall, however, be cumulative in nature and not exclusive
and shall be in addition to any other remedies whatsoever which any party may
otherwise have. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges that the existence of
any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the
availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any other
injunctive relief. Each of the parties further acknowledges and agrees that
injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not cause an undue hardship
to such party.



12.16 Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Skadden has been engaged by the
Seller and its Affiliates to represent it in connection with the Transactions,
the Purchaser hereby (i) waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise after the Closing between
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, and (ii) agrees that Skadden may
represent the Seller or any of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interest of the Seller may be directly adverse to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, and even though Skadden may have represented the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. In
addition, the Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, as to all communications among any of Skadden or the Seller Entities
or any of their respective directors, managers, members, partners, officers or
employees or Affiliates that relate in any way to this Agreement or the
Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Seller and shall be controlled solely by the Seller
and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.
Accordingly, the Purchaser shall not have access to any such communications,
or to the files of Skadden relating to its engagement, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Purchaser, on
its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, further understands and agrees
that the consummation of the Transactions may result in the inadvertent
disclosure of such information that may be confidential or subject to a claim
of privilege. The Purchaser, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
further understands and agrees that any disclosure of such information that
may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will not prejudice or
otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. The Purchaser, on its
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to return promptly any such inadvertently disclosed information to the
appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its existence. The Purchaser agrees
to take, and to cause its Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement
the intent of this Section 12.16.



12.17 Rescission. In the event (a) any Governmental Authority in the
jurisdictions set forth in Section 6.4 that must grant an Approval required by
Section 6.4 shall have denied such Approval and such denial shall have become
final and non-appealable; or (b) following the Closing Date, the FTC shall
have notified Seller that Purchaser is not an acceptable acquirer of the
Product Lines and that the Transactions are required to be rescinded, then, in
each case, Seller shall have the right immediately to rescind this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements. If Seller determines to rescind this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements, Seller and Purchaser shall promptly take all
actions as may be necessary or desirable to rescind the consummation of the
Transactions and to restore to each party its rights, powers and obligations
as in existence immediately prior to the Closing, including (x) Seller
refunding to Purchaser all funds received by Seller from Purchaser as payment
of the Purchase Price, (y) execution by Purchaser and its Affiliates of such
assignments, transfers and other documents and instruments as may be necessary
or desirable to convey, assign and transfer back to the applicable Seller
Entity all of the Purchaser's and each of its Affiliates' right, title and
interest in and to any Purchased Assets and to terminate and cancel the
Transaction Agreements, and (z) execution by the applicable Seller Entity of
such assumptions and other documents and instruments as may be necessary or
desirable to relieve Purchaser of liability for any Assumed Liabilities
existing on the Closing Date and to terminate and cancel the Transaction
Agreements.



12.18 Electronic Data Room Materials. No information or document will be
considered to have been "made available" to Purchaser unless it was uploaded
no later than 9:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day prior to the 

date of this Agreement to the electronic dataroom hosted by Merrill
Corporation for "Project Corfu-Rhodes" (available through the Closing at
https://login.merrillcorp.com/), a copy of which Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser on one or more DVDs (or other digital storage device as Purchaser
and Seller agree) at or promptly after Closing, and was fully accessible to
Purchaser and its Representatives through the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement.
