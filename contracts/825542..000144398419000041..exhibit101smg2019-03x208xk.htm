enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by such Party and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of such Party enforceable against such Party in accordance
with its terms, except to the extent that the enforcement thereof may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and

(c) No Violations. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Party,
the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the

a breach, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) under any provision of its charter, bylaws or other similar
organizational documents (if and as applicable) or any agreement or other
instrument to which it is a party. No consent, approval, authorization, order,
filing, registration

including any that may be set forth in the LLC Agreement. The Parties hereby
waive any and all provisions under the LLC Agreement that restrict, or might
restrict, the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void,

fully separable and shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction and (b) all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect and shall be deemed substituted for the provision at issue, a valid,
legal and enforceable provision. Upon a determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent
permitted by Law in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be

the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements,
communications, understandings and 

undertakings with respect to the subject matter hereof, both written and oral.
This Agreement shall not be deemed to contain or imply any restriction,
covenant, representation, warranty, agreement or undertaking of any party with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those expressly set
forth herein, and none shall be deemed to exist or be inferred with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

4.5 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

4.6 Public Announcements. The timing and content of all press releases or
other written public announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby by a Party shall be subject to prior
consultation with and the consent of the other Parties (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that (i) a Party may, without the
prior consent of any other Party, issue such a press release or other similar
public statement or disclosure (including in current, quarterly and annual
forms filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in connection with
earnings, analyst and similar conferences customary for a public company) as
may be required by, or deemed advisable to comply with, in either case, in the
good faith judgment of the disclosing Party, applicable Law or any listing
agreement with a securities exchange or debt agreement to which the disclosing
Party is a party, in which case, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable under the circumstances, use reasonable efforts to
consult with the other Parties regarding the form and content of such
disclosure prior to the disclosure thereof and (ii) without limiting clause
(i) above, once the content of a disclosure by a disclosing Party has been
approved by the other Parties, the disclosing Party may make public disclosure
of substantially similar content in subsequent statements or filings.

4.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

proceeding or counterclaim relating thereto, except in the courts described
above in New York, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction
to enforce any judgment,

the action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C)

any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
