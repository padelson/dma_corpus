v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of May 7,
2009 is among Covidien Group S.a.r.l. (" _Parent_ "), a Luxembourg company,
Covidien Delaware Corp. (" _Sub_ "), a newly-formed Delaware corporation and a
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc. (the " _Company_ "), a Delaware corporation.

R E C I T A L S

WHEREAS, Parent and the Board of Directors of each of Sub and the Company has
approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Sub commence a cash
tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all shares of the issued and
outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "
_Shares_ "), for $29.00 for each Share, net to the seller in cash (such
price, or any such higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offer,
referred to herein as the " _Offer Price_ "), without interest;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Sub and the Company has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger (as defined in Section 1.3(a)) following the Offer in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ ") and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share
in the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of such Shares and has
resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and, if
necessary, adopt this Agreement and thereby approve the Merger upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement, certain
Company stockholders (the " _Principal Stockholders_ ") have entered into
tender and voting agreements, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially
the form set forth in  _Annex II_ hereof, pursuant to which, among other
things, each of the Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender his, her or
its Shares to Sub in the Offer (the " _Tender and Voting Agreements_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

SECTION 1  THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, Parent shall cause Sub to, and Sub shall, commence (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer no later than May 18, 2009 (the date on which the
Offer is commenced being referred to herein as the " _Commencement Date_ ").
The obligations of Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be
extended in accordance with requirements of this Section 1.1(a)) shall be
subject only to the conditions set forth in     _Annex I_ hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the prior
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver by Parent or Sub of the
Offer Conditions, Parent shall cause Sub to, and Sub shall, consummate the
Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment all Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and pay the Offer Price in
exchange for each such Share promptly following such acceptance in compliance
with Rule 14e-1(c) of the Exchange Act (the time at which Sub first accepts
any Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer being referred to herein as the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to
purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in
this Agreement and the Offer Conditions. Parent expressly reserves the right
to waive any of the Offer Conditions, to increase the Offer Price and to make
any other changes in the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sub
shall not, and Parent shall cause Sub not to, without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent to be authorized by the Company Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof), (i) decrease the Offer
Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii)
decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer, (iv) waive or change the
Minimum Condition, (v) impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any
of the Offer Conditions so as to broaden the scope of such Offer Condition,
(vi) extend the Offer beyond a date that is twenty-one (21) business days
after commencement of the Offer or the last extension (in accordance with this
Section 1.1), if any, of the Offer, whichever is later (the " _Expiration
Date_ ") except as set forth in Sections 1.1(b) and 1.1(c), or (vii)
otherwise amend any other term or condition of the Offer in a manner
materially adverse to the holders of Shares.

(b) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire on the twenty-first
(21st) business day following the Commencement Date (calculated as set forth
in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange
Act). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to the parties respective termination rights set forth in Section
8.1, (i) if, at the time as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been validly waived, then Sub
may extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for additional successive
periods of up to twenty (20) business days per extension (with the length of
such periods to be determined by Parent) until all of the Offer Conditions
have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, validly waived, and (ii), Sub
shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation or
interpretation of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("
_SEC_ "), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer. In addition to the
foregoing, Sub also may provide a "subsequent offering period" in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act if, as of the Expiration Date, all of
the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived,
but there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer that number of Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected
without a meeting of the Companys stockholders in accordance with the DGCL.

(c) Subject to the parties respective termination rights set forth in
Section 8.1, if, at the time as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any
Offer Condition has not been satisfied or has not been validly waived and
there has not been an Adverse Recommendation Change, then, if so requested by
the Company by written notice at least two (2) business days prior to the date
the Offer is then scheduled to expire, Sub shall extend the Offer for up to
two (2) successive periods of ten (10) business days per extension period,
until all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted, validly waived.

(d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Sub shall file with
the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation
M-A_ "), a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a related form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). Subject to Section 5.2, the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation
referred to in Section 3.20(a). Parent and Sub agree to take commercially
reasonable steps to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and,
subject to the Companys compliance with Section 1.2(c), disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Law. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the  



 

2  Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. Parent and
Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
TO and any amendment thereto before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and
Sub shall include all additions, deletions or changes thereto suggested by the
Company and its legal counsel that Parent reasonably determines to be
appropriate. In addition, Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company with any
comments, whether written or oral, that Parent, Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time prior to the expiration or termination of the
Offer, from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, promptly
upon receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto, and
the Company shall have the right to consult with Parent, Sub and
their counsel prior to responding to any such comments, either in written or
oral form, and Parent and Sub shall incorporate in each response those views
and comments of the Company and its legal counsel related thereto that Parent
reasonably determines to be appropriate.

(e) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub as promptly as
practicable following the expiration of the Offer and any subsequent offering
period, as applicable, all funds necessary to pay for those Shares that have
been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and that Sub is
obligated to accept for payment pursuant to the Offer and permitted to accept
for payment under applicable Law.

1.2. _Company Actions_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.2 and to any consents or approvals of the Companys
stockholders required under applicable Law, the Company hereby approves of
and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) On the date the Offer is commenced, the Company shall, in a manner that
complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ")
which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2, contain the Company
Board Recommendation. The Company further agrees to take commercially
reasonable steps to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Law. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct and supplement any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
Law. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent and Sub shall be given the opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto before filing with
the SEC, and the Company shall include all additions, deletions or changes
thereto suggested by Parent and its legal counsel that the Company reasonably
determines to be appropriate. In addition, the Company agrees to provide
Parent and Sub any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and to consult
with Parent, Sub and their counsel prior to responding to any such comments,
either in written or oral form, and the Company shall incorporate in each
response those views and comments of Parent and its legal counsel related
thereto that the Company reasonably determines to be appropriate.

(c) The Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent or
Sub mailing labels, security position listings and all available listings and
computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the
Shares as of a recent date, and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date, and shall promptly furnish Parent or Sub with such
information and assistance (including, but not limited to, lists of holders of
the Shares, updated periodically, and their addresses, mailing labels and
lists of security positions) as Parent or Sub or its agent(s) may reasonably
request.  



 

3  Subject to applicable Law, such information shall be held confidential by
Parent and Sub under the terms of the Confidentiality and Standstill
Agreement, dated February 3, 2009 entered into between Tyco Healthcare Group
LP, d/b/a Covidien and the Company (as amended, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement does not restrict steps to prepare, file or
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

1.3. _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.4), the Company and Sub shall consummate a
merger (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the DGCL pursuant to which (i)
Sub will be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Sub will thereupon cease; (ii) the Company will be the successor
or surviving corporation in the Merger and will continue to be governed by the
Laws of the State of Delaware; (iii) the separate corporate existence of the
Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises
will continue unaffected by the Merger; and (iv) the Company will succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub. The corporation surviving
the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_." The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to
read in the form of _Annex III_ and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to be identical to the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except that such bylaws shall be amended to
reflect that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc.), and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided by the DGCL, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

1.4. _Effective Time_. Parent, Sub and the Company shall cause an
appropriate certificate of merger complying with Section 251 of the DGCL or
an appropriate certificate of ownership and merger complying with Section 253
of the DGCL, as applicable (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), to be executed
and filed on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.5) (or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
on the time and date on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later time and
date as is specified in the Certificate of Merger, such time hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

1.5. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 9:00 a.m. (Boston time) on a date to be specified by the parties, such
date to be no later than the second (2nd) business day after satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted, waiver of all of the conditions set forth in SECTION
7 capable of satisfaction or waiver prior to Closing (the " _Closing Date_
"), at the offices of Ropes and Gray, LLP, One International Place, Boston,
Massachusetts 02110, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto.

1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,  



 

4  designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause each member of the Company Board of Directors, other than Parents or
Subs designees pursuant to Section 6.9, to execute and deliver a letter
effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Company upon the
Effective Time.

1.7. _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of
the Company or Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as
a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

1.8. _Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Tender Completion
Time:

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger (the " _Special Meeting_ ");

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act a preliminary proxy
or information statement relating to the Merger and this Agreement and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish the information required to be
included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter defined) and,
after Parent shall have had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with
respect to the preliminary proxy or information statement and cause a
definitive proxy or information statement (in either case, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable;

(iii) subject to Section 5.2, include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that stockholders of the
Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger; and

(iv) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from holders of Shares
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger and take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure
the approval of stockholders required by the DGCL and any other applicable
Law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws (if applicable)
to effect the Merger.

(b) Parent agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then
beneficially owned by it or Sub in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger.

1.9. _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding Section 1.8, in
the event that Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at
least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, the parties hereto agree, at the request of Parent and subject to
SECTION 7, to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a
meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with and subject to the
DGCL. 



 

5 1.10. _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price paid in the Offer that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up
Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the
number of Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than ninety
percent (90%) of the Shares outstanding immediately after the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of Shares in
excess of the Shares authorized and unissued at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option and (ii) the Top-Up Option may not be exercised unless,
following the Acceptance Time or after a subsequent offering period, eighty
percent (80%) or more of the Shares shall be directly or indirectly owned by
Parent or Sub. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once at any time
following the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (A) the
Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act. If Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Sub shall give
the Company one (1) business day prior written notice, specifying (i)
the number of Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of
such notice and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice,
deliver written notice to Sub specifying, based on the information provided
by Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the
purchase of Top-Up Shares, the purchase price owed by Sub to the Company
therefor shall be paid to the Company (A) in cash, by wire transfer or
cashiers check or (B) by issuance by Sub to the Company of a promissory note
on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

SECTION 2  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares or
any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub (" _Sub Common
Stock_ "):

(a) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common Stock
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ All Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares owned by Parent or
Sub shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be payable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.3(a))) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-
Entry Share_ ") representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of such certificate or
book-entry share in accordance with Section 2.2.

2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall designate Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
or another bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall  



 

6  become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis, promptly after
the Effective Time and as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash
necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay
the amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.1(c),
Parent shall promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to
deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments
of Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any
event be liable for payment thereof. The Paying Agent may invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States, in commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in money market funds that invest only in such United States
government and commercial paper obligations, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or a Book-Entry
Share, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
Shares, whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify); and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and properly completed and such other documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share, formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable,
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, without interest thereon, and shall not evidence any
interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other
equity holder of, the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this SECTION 2.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following nine
(9) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any holder of a Certificate or  



 

7  Book-Entry Share, as applicable, for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, are not
surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time, unclaimed Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Shares shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

2.3.  _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
right to appraisal. From and after the Effective Time, a stockholder who has
properly exercised such appraisal rights shall not have any rights of a
stockholder of the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Shares, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Shares held by him, her or it in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in which case such
Shares shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate or Certificates, pursuant to Section 2.2.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written
demands for appraisal (including copies of such demands), attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by the Company
relating to rights of appraisal; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.

2.4. _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option, stock
equivalent right or right to acquire Shares (each a " _Company Option_ " and
collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") granted under the Companys Amended
and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and 1995 Stock Plan (the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), without regard to the extent then vested and exercisable,
shall be cancelled and, in consideration of such cancellation, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly following the Effective
Time, pay to such holders of Company Options, an amount in respect thereof
equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over
the exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number of
unexercised Shares subject thereto (such payment, if any, to be net of
applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.6).

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit,
representing a right to receive one Share (each a " _Company RSU_ " and
collectively, the " _Company RSUs_ ") granted under any Company Stock Plan,
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will become fully
vested ( _provided_ , _however_ , that only 1,250 of the 5,000 Company RSUs
granted in 2009 pursuant to Section 12 of the Companys Amended and Restated
2000 Equity Incentive Plan to each of the independent members of the Company
Board of Directors, which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will become vested as of the Effective Time) and then will be cancelled
at the Effective Time, and in consideration of  



 

8  such cancellation, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly following the Effective Time, pay to such holders of Company
RSUs, an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (x) the Offer
Price and (y) the number of Shares into which the vested portion of the
Company RSU would otherwise be convertible (such payment, if any, to be net of
applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.6).

(c) As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall terminate and
all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as defined in Section
3.4(a)) shall be cancelled. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
effectuate the foregoing, including, but not limited to, sending out the
requisite notices and obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and cancel
all Company Options and Company RSUs necessary to ensure that, after the
Effective Time, no person shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans,
except as set forth herein.

2.5. _Section 16_. The Company Board of Directors shall, to the extent
necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Acceptance Time, to
approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act the
disposition and cancellation of Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

2.6. _Withholding_. Each of Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from
any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder or former holder of Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or
the Treasury Regulations thereunder or any other Tax Law. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted and withheld, and such deduction and withholding would
have been required were Parent incorporated or organized in the United States
or a subdivision thereof, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid. To the extent that such amounts are required
to be deducted and withheld under the Tax Law of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, and such deduction and withholding would not have been required
were Parent incorporated or organized in the United States or a subdivision
thereof, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause the Paying
Agent to, pay to the applicable holder or former holder of Shares, Company
Options or Company RSUs such additional amounts as necessary to ensure that
such holder or former holder receives the same amount that would otherwise
have been received if no such deduction and withholding had been made.

2.7. _Transfer Taxes_. If any payment pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable,
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Any other
transfer Taxes shall be paid by Parent. 

SECTION 3  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except as set forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent on the date hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Section
numbers of which are numbered to correspond to the Section numbers of this
Agreement to which they refer (provided, however, that an item disclosed in
any Section shall be deemed to have been disclosed for each other Section of
this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other
Section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure), the Company hereby makes the following representations and
warranties to, and agreements with, Parent and Sub:

3.1. _Organization and Qualification_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its  



 

9  assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company is
qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions
in which such qualification is required by Law, except for jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. " _Company Material
Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any change, event, circumstance, effect or
development that, individually or in the aggregate with all other changes,
events, circumstances, effects or developments that exist on the date of
determination of the occurrence of a Company Material Adverse Effect, has had
or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on (i) the assets,
properties, business, capitalization, results of operations or condition
(financial or other) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole or (ii) the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ __, _however_ , that in no event
shall changes, events, circumstances, effects or developments to the extent
resulting from any of the following be taken into account in determining
whether there is, has been or is reasonably likely to be a "Company Material
Adverse Effect": (A) changes in conditions of the economy or securities
markets of the United States in general that in each case, do not have a
disproportionate impact on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to other persons engaged in business in the medical device
industry, (B) changes in conditions affecting the medical device industry, in
each case, without a disproportionate impact on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other persons engaged in business
in the medical device industry, (C) changes to applicable Law or generally
accepted accounting principles or, in either case, the interpretation thereof
that do not have a disproportionate impact on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other persons engaged in business
in the medical device industry, (D) any change in the trading price or trading
volume of the Shares (it being understood that the underlying facts or
circumstances giving rise to any such change may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is likely to be a Company Material
Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances are not otherwise excluded
pursuant to clauses (A) through (F) of this definition), (E) the announcement
of the execution of this Agreement or the pendency of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (F) any failure of the Company to meet securities
analysts published or internal projections or forecasts or estimates of
earnings or revenues (it being understood that the underlying facts or
circumstances giving rise to any such failure may be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is likely to be a Company
Material Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances are not otherwise
excluded pursuant to clauses (A) through (F) of this definition).

(b) The Company has previously provided to Parent true and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organizational documents
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as presently in effect, and none
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observation or fulfillment of such documents, except, in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries, such defaults that, in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.2. _Authority to Execute and Perform Agreement_. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject, in the case of consummation of the Merger, to the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the Shares, to perform fully its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by the Company Board of Directors. No other corporate action on the part of
the Company is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the Shares and the
filing of a certificate of merger or other appropriate document with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Sub) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent enforceability may be limited by the effect of applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and the effect of general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at Law or in equity.



 

10 3.3. _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement consists of 56,666,666 Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred

in the Companys certificate of incorporation. As of the close of business on
May 7, 2009, (i) 16,222,026 Shares were issued and outstanding and (ii) no
shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding.

(b) Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes a list, as of
the date of this Agreement, of (i) each outstanding Company Option under the

grant date, the expiration date, the exercise price, and whether any option
is an incentive stock option, (ii) the total number of Shares issued under
each Company Stock Plan, (iii) the total number of Shares reserved for future
issuance under each Company Stock Plan, and (iv) each outstanding
Company RSU, including the identification number of the applicable holder,

of each Company Subsidiary and, for the Company and each Company Subsidiary,
the jurisdictions in which it is qualified to do business. Section 3.4(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule also sets forth for each such Company
Subsidiary the individuals who comprise the board of directors or
comparable body for each such entity. The Company agrees to take, or cause to
be taken, the actions necessary so that those individuals will resign and be
replaced by individuals specified by Parent effective as of the Effective
Time. All issued and outstanding shares or other equity interests of each
Company Subsidiary are owned directly by the Company free and clear of any
charges, liens, encumbrances, security interests or adverse claims. As used in

or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i)
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a general partner or (ii) at least

power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation (to the extent such
concepts are applicable) in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized,
qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that are
not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are
not as of the date hereof, and at the Effective Time there will not be, any
subscriptions, options, conversion or exchange rights, warrants, repurchase or
redemption agreements, or other agreements, claims or commitments of any
nature whatsoever obligating any Company Subsidiary to issue, transfer,

the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company

term " _Company Joint Venture_ " means any corporation or other entity
(including partnership, limited liability company and other business
association) that is not a Company Subsidiary and in which the Company or one
or more Company Subsidiaries owns an equity interest (other than equity

warranty of non-infringement or misappropriation of any third party
intellectual property or proprietary rights, which is addressed in subsection
(iv) below.

(v) _Maintenance and Filing Requirements_. With respect to Company Registered
Intellectual Property and registered copyrights currently owned by the
Company, the Company has taken all steps necessary to maintain registrations
thereof, including by payment when due of all maintenance fees and annuities
and the filing of all necessary renewals, statements and certifications.
Assignment documents have been executed and filed with relevant Governmental
Entities as necessary to transfer to the Company or a Company Subsidiary
title to any of the Company-Owned Proprietary Rights previously owned by a
third party and to record such transfer. The inventors of each of the
Companys owned patent applications have assigned the Companys owned
patent applications to the Company. On the Expiration Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with a schedule of any maintenance fees, actions or other
amounts due to Governmental Entities falling due within ninety (90) days after
the Expiration Date with respect to such Company-Owned Proprietary Rights.

(vi) _Absence of Claims; Non-infringement_. To the Companys knowledge, the
Company is not aware of any claim by any third party that the businesses of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries infringe upon the proprietary rights
of others, nor, to the Companys knowledge, do the current products or
services of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries infringe the Intellectual
Property Rights of any third party; and, except as otherwise disclosed under
the heading "Legal Proceedings" in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice alleging any interference,
infringement, misappropriation, or conflict that the businesses of the Company
or the Company  



 

18  Subsidiaries infringe upon the proprietary rights of others (including any
claim that the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any of their affiliates
must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property Rights). To the
Companys knowledge, no third party has infringed upon any of the Company-
Owned Proprietary Rights, or asserted any competing claim of right to use or
own any of, the Company-Owned Proprietary Rights.

(vii) _Royalties and Licenses_. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor the Company
Subsidiaries currently have any royalty obligations to third parties to sell
their products and services.

(viii) _Protection of Company Proprietary Information_. To the knowledge of
the Company, none of the activities of the employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary on behalf of such entity violates any agreement or
arrangement which any such employees have with former employers. To the
knowledge of the Company, all employees and consultants who contributed to the
discovery or development of any of the subject matter claimed in the
Companys owned patent applications did so either (x) within the scope of
their employment such that, in accordance with applicable Law, all rights to
such developed subject matter became the exclusive property of the Company or
the Company Subsidiary or (y) pursuant to written agreements assigning all
rights to such developed subject matter to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary. Assignment documents assigning to Company all rights of such
employees, contractors and consultants have been duly filed in all relevant
patent offices worldwide for all non-provisional patent applications and
patents owned in whole or in part by Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, each employee, contractor or consultant of the Company who has
knowledge of any of the Companys proprietary information relating to the
manufacturing processes, or the formulation of the products, of the Company or
a Company Subsidiary has executed and delivered to the Company an agreement
or agreements restricting such persons right to use and disclose confidential
information of the Company.

(ix) _No Restrictions_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no settlements, consents,
judgments, orders or similar obligations required by a Government Entity to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party that: (i) restrict any
Company-Owned Proprietary Rights, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business
of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their employees; or (iii)
grant third parties any material rights under Company-Owned Proprietary
Rights. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, there are no forbearances to sue, settlements or
similar obligations to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party
that: (i) restrict any Company-Owned Proprietary Rights, (ii) restrict the
conduct of the business of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their employees; or (iii) grant third parties any material rights under
Company-Owned Proprietary Rights, other than non-exclusive licenses granted in
the ordinary course of business to distributors, resellers or customers.

(x) _Confidentiality_. To the knowledge of the Company and except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
material trade secret of the Company has been disclosed or authorized to be
disclosed to any third party in violation of confidentiality obligations to
the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, no party to a nondisclosure
agreement with the Company is in breach or default thereof.

(xi)  _No Impairment_. To the knowledge of the Company and except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
execution of, the delivery of, the consummation of the Offer and Merger
contemplated by, and the performance of the Companys obligations under, this
Agreement will not result in any loss or impairment of any Company-Owned
Proprietary Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, neither government
funding nor government, academic or non-profit research facilities were used
in the development of any of the patent applications owned by the Company.



 

19 (b) With respect to property other than Company-Owned Proprietary Rights, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary has all assets, properties, rights and
contracts necessary to permit the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
conduct their business as it is currently being conducted, except where the
failure to have such assets, properties, rights and contracts would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary has good and marketable title to all of its
properties, interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected
in the Company Balance Sheet (except properties, interests in properties and
assets sold or otherwise disposed of since the date of the Company Balance
Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice),
or with respect to leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in
such properties and assets, in each case, free and clear of all imperfections
of title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements, except (i) liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable, that are payable without penalty
or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii)
such imperfections of title, restrictions, encroachments, liens and easements
as do not and could not reasonably be expected to materially detract from or
interfere with the use or value of the properties subject thereto or affected
thereby, or otherwise materially impair business operations involving such
properties and (iii) liens securing debt which are reflected on the Company
Balance Sheet. There are no written or oral subleases, licenses, occupancy
agreements or other contractual obligations that grant the right of use or
occupancy of any real property leased by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Real Property_ "), and there is no person in
possession of the Real Property other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. There is no pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened eminent domain, condemnation or similar proceeding
affecting any Real Property leased by the Company or a Company Subsidiary. To
the knowledge of the Company, the property and equipment of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary that are used in the operations of business are (i)
in good operating condition and repair and (ii) have been maintained in
accordance with normal industry practices. Section 3.12(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists all Real Property leased by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns
any Real Property.

3.13.  _Insurance_. All policies or binders of material fire, liability,
product liability, workers compensation, vehicular, directors and officers
and other material insurance held by or on behalf of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect in all material respects,
are reasonably adequate for the businesses engaged in by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and are in conformity in all material respects with the
requirements of all leases or other agreements to which the Company or the
relevant Company Subsidiary is a party and, to the knowledge of the Company,
are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is in default in any material respect with respect
to any provision contained in such policy or binder nor has any of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary failed to give any notice or present any material
claim under any such policy or binder in due and timely fashion. All premiums
for each policy or binder have been paid for the current period, and there are
no outstanding premium finance payments due for such period. There are no
material outstanding unpaid claims under any such policy or binder. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice of cancellation or
non-renewal of any such policy or binder. All applications for the Companys
currently effective directors and officers insurance were true, correct and
complete in all material respects when submitted to the carrier. No coverage
limits of insurance policies covering the Company or a Company Subsidiary have
been exhausted.

3.14. _Commercial Relationships_. During the last twelve months prior to the
date of this Agreement, none of the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries
material suppliers, collaborators, distributors, licensors or licensees has
canceled or otherwise terminated its relationship with the Company or a
Company Subsidiary or has materially altered its relationship with the Company
or a Company Subsidiary, and the Company has not received any written threat
or notice from any such entity, to terminate, cancel or otherwise materially
modify its relationship with the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

3.15. _Tax Matters_.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " (and, with correlative
meaning, " _Taxes_ " and " _Taxable_ ") means all United States federal, state
and local, and all non-U.S., income, profits, franchise,  



 

20  gross receipts, payroll, transfer, sales, employment, social security,
unemployment insurance, workers compensation, use, property, excise,
value added, ad valorem, estimated, stamp, alternative or add-on minimum,
recapture, capital, withholding and any other taxes, charges, duties,
impositions or assessments, and any other taxes, fees, charges, levies,
excises, duties or assessments of any kind whatsoever, together with all
interest, penalties and additions imposed on or with respect to such amounts.
" _Tax Return_ " means any return, declaration, report, claim for refund, tax
shelter disclosure statements or information return or statement filed or
required to be filed with any taxing authority in connection with the
determination, assessment, collection or imposition of any Taxes, including
any attachments thereto and any amendments thereof.

(b) All federal income Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all
material respects, and all material Taxes due and payable by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, have
been paid except for those Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. No
claim has ever been made in writing by any taxing authority in any
jurisdiction where the Company or the Company Subsidiaries do not file Tax
Returns that the Company or the Company Subsidiaries are or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.

(c) There are no material liens or other encumbrances with respect to Taxes
upon any of the assets or properties of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, other than with respect to Taxes not yet due and payable or
those Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles.

(d) No audit is currently pending or threatened with respect to any Tax Return
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, nor have any material
deficiencies for any Taxes been proposed, asserted, threatened or assessed
against the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

(e) Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries has extended or waived
the application of any statute of limitations of any jurisdiction regarding
the assessment or collection of any Tax of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries.

(f) The unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of the date of the Company
Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Company Balance Sheet. The Company has
not incurred any material Tax liability outside the ordinary course of
business since the date of the Company Balance Sheet.

(g) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have withheld all material Taxes
required by Law or contract to be withheld from the wages, salaries or other
payments to (i) employees, independent contractors, creditors, stockholders of
or consultants to the Company and (ii) any other third party, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, paid to the appropriate Governmental
Entity.

(h) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not a party to or bound by,
nor do they have any obligation under, any Tax sharing, Tax indemnification
or Tax allocation agreement or similar arrangement. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has any material liability for the Taxes of any other
person (other than Taxes of any member of a consolidated group of which the
Company is the common parent) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise.

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has (i) made to any
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) any
payments or (ii) been or is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
plan that in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) above, has resulted or will
result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the  



 

21  Code or in the imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code
(or any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law).
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, nor is
otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that
provides for the gross-up of the excise Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code (or any corresponding provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law).

(j) Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries has made any
payments that have, or has been or is a party to any agreement, contract,
arrangement or plan that have, resulted or will result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any compensation which would be subject to the
deduction limit imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code.

(k) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has distributed stock of
another corporation, or has had its stock distributed by another corporation,
in a transaction that was governed, or purported or intended to be governed,
in whole or in part, by Sections 355 or 361 of the Code, during the last three
years.

(l) Since January 1, 2006, neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries
has (i) changed any financial or Tax accounting methods, policies or
practices of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, except as
required by a change in United States generally accepted accounting principles
or SEC rules, regulations or guidelines or applicable Law, (ii)

in, or exclude any material item of deduction from, Taxable income for any
Taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a
result of any: (i) adjustment under Section 481 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) made
prior to the Closing Date or (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provisions of state, local
or non-U.S. Tax Law) executed during the six (6) year period ending on the
Closing Date.

(n) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in
any "listed transaction" identified pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2) or any corresponding or similar provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. Law.

3.16. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date
of this Agreement, each material employee benefit plan (as hereinafter
defined) (i) that is currently maintained, contributed (or required to
be contributed) to, or sponsored by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
(ii) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or (iii) with
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any material
liability, including any material contingent liability, for the payment or
delivery of any premiums, compensation or benefits (collectively, the "
_Plans_ "). For purposes of the preceding sentence, an "employee benefit plan"
is any of the following that benefits or is intended to benefit any current
or former employee or director (whether or not an employee) of, or consultant
or other service provider (whether or not an employee) with respect to the
Company or an ERISA Affiliate (as defined in Section 3.16(b)), or the
beneficiaries of any of them: (A) a "plan" described in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "); (B)
a stock bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, restricted
stock unit, stock appreciation right, or other equity-based plan, policy,
program, agreement or arrangement; or (C) an incentive, bonus, deferred
compensation, welfare, retiree medical or life insurance, retirement,
supplemental retirement, termination, salary continuation, severance, change
in control, and any material fringe benefit or other material benefit plan,
policy, program, agreement or arrangement, whether written or unwritten. With
respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete
copy of each of the following, together with all amendments: (i) all documents
 



 

22  embodying the Plan (or, where a Plan has not been reduced to writing, a
summary of all material Plan terms), (ii) in the case of any funded Plan,
the trust agreement or similar instrument, (iii) for each Plan subject to the
requirement that annual reports be filed on a Form 5500, the two most recently
filed annual reports, with schedules, financial statements and auditors
opinion attached, (iv) in the case of each Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent IRS determination or opinion
letter applicable to the Plan, (v) all related custodial agreements, insurance
policies (including fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries of
the Plan), administrative services and similar agreements, and investment
advisory or investment management agreements, if any, and (vi) the most recent
summary plan description, summaries of material modifications or similar
summary and any employee handbook referencing the Plan.

(b) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other person
(including an entity) that together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is or at any relevant time was treated as a single employer under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, together with the Company and any
Company Subsidiary, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has ever contributed or been
required to contribute to, or has ever sponsored, maintained or participated
in, (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject
to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), or (iii) a
single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA) for which an ERISA Affiliate would reasonably be expected to incur
liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Except as described in Section
3.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, by themselves or together with any other event, cause
or result in the payment, acceleration or vesting of any payment, right or
benefit under any Plan.

(c) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code is the subject of a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "). No such determination or opinion
letter has been revoked, and, to the Companys knowledge, revocation has not
been threatened. To the Companys knowledge, no such Plan has been amended or
operated since the date of its most recent determination or opinion letter in
any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect
its qualification.

(d) Each Plan has been maintained and administered at all times in accordance
with its material terms. Each Plan, including any associated trust or fund,
has been established and administered in material compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Law (including,
where applicable, non-U.S. Law), and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing
has occurred with respect to any Plan that has subjected or could reasonably
be expected to subject the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability or
penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or to any tax under Chapter 43 of the Code.
All filings and reports with respect to each Plan required to have been
submitted to the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or any other
Governmental Entity have been duly and timely submitted.

(e) No Plan provides health or life insurance benefits following retirement or
other termination of employment, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any obligation to provide any such benefits following
retirement or other termination of employment, in each case except for benefit
continuation coverage to the extent required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA.

(f) With respect to each Plan, no administrative investigation, inquiry, audit
or other proceeding by the IRS, Department of Labor other Governmental
Entity, and no other lawsuit, claim, or other controversy, other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course and proceedings with respect to qualified
domestic relations orders, is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened.

(g) With respect to each Plan, all contributions (including salary
reduction contributions), premiums and other payments (i) to the extent due,
have been timely made, and (ii) to the extent not yet due, have been
appropriately accrued on the books of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

(h) Each Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (" _Section 409A_") has
been operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A. No Plan, which is
subject to the requirements of Section 409A, violates such  



 

23  requirements. All Company Options granted by the Company after October 3,
2004 or which vest or vested (in whole or in part) after December 31, 2004,
have (or, if already terminated, had) an exercise price that was not less than
the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the date such Company
Option was granted. The Company is not a party to, nor is otherwise obligated
under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the
gross-up of Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

(i) Except for the plans listed on Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Plan is subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction other than the
United States, whether or not United States Law also applies. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American
Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands and the Virgin Islands shall be
considered jurisdictions other than the United States.

(j) Each Plan and its related documentation or agreement, summary plan
description, or other written communication distributed generally to
employees by its terms expressly and adequately reserves the right to amend
and terminate such Plan, and each Plan may be terminated without material
liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for vested benefits
accrued through the date of termination and the administrative and
professional costs incurred in such transaction. Except as listed in Section
3.16(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Plan includes in its assets any
securities issued by the Company or any of Company Subsidiary.

3.17. _Employee Relations_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.17(a), upon termination of
the employment of any employees or the service relationship of any director
or consultant, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Surviving
Corporation nor Parent shall be liable, by reason of the Offer or Merger, to
any of such employees, directors, or consultants for severance pay or any
other similar payments (other than accrued salary, vacation or sick pay in
accordance with normal policies), except as set forth in Section 3.17(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary (i) is in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable foreign, Federal, state and local Laws,
rules and regulations respecting employment, employment practices,
occupational safety and health, terms and conditions of employment and wages
and hours, in each case, with respect to employees, (ii) has withheld all
material amounts required by Law or by agreement to be withheld from the
wages, salaries and other payments to employees, (iii) is not liable for any
material arrears of wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other direct
compensation for any services performed or amounts required to be reimbursed
to any employees or consultants or any material taxes or any penalty for
failure to comply with any of the foregoing, and (iv) is not liable for any
payment to any trust or other fund or to any Governmental Entity, with
respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other
benefits or obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice), except
for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a liability in excess of $1 million.

(c) No work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is involved in or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with, any labor dispute, grievance, or litigation
relating to labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any employee,
including without limitation charges of unfair labor practices or
discrimination complaints that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected to result in material liability to the Company. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair labor practices within
the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act that could reasonably be
expected to result in material liability to the Company. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is presently, nor has it been since January 1,
2006, a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement or union
contract with respect to employees other than as set forth in Section 3.17 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and no collective bargaining agreement is
being negotiated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. To the knowledge
of the Company, no union organizing campaign or activity with respect to non-
union employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is ongoing, pending
or threatened.



 

24 (d) Section 3.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list, as
of the date of this Agreement, of all independent contractors currently
performing services relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or under
contract to perform such future services for the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. All such individuals have acknowledged in writing that they are
not employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and are not entitled to
any employee compensation or benefits. Accurate and complete copies of all
written agreements with any such independent contractor have been made
available to Parent.

(e) Section 3.17(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date
of this Agreement, each written agreement with any current employee, director
or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (i) under which the amount
or timing of benefits are contingent, or the terms are altered, upon

Subsidiary of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee, or
(iii) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of
employment of such employee, director or officer.

3.18. _Environmental Matters_. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Section 3.18 shall constitute the sole
representations and warranties with respect to environmental matters. Except
as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or as set forth in Schedule 3.18 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule:

(a) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation
of, or has been notified in writing by any Governmental Entity at any time
since January 1, 2007 that it is in violation of any Environmental Law (as

3.18(e)(ii)) by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in violation
of any Environmental Law at any property currently owned or operated by, or
premises leased by, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries during the
period of the Companys or such Company Subsidiarys ownership, operation or
lease which created any requirement pursuant to Environmental Law for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to remediate such property.

(b) No property currently or formerly owned or operated by, or premises
currently or formerly leased by, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is listed, or to the Companys knowledge, proposed for listing,

Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (" _CERCLA_ "), or on any comparable state governmental lists. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notification of,
and the Company has no knowledge of, any potential responsibility or liability
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of (i)
CERCLA, or (ii) any similar Federal, state, local, foreign or other
Environmental Law.

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have obtained all permits
required by Environmental Law necessary to enable them to conduct their
respective businesses as currently conducted and are in compliance with such
permits. All such permits are in full force and effect and, to the Companys

revocation, cancellation, suspension or any adverse modification of any such
permits.

(d) The Company previously has made available to Parent copies of all
environmental site assessments prepared by any person, and permits required
under Environmental Laws and all other material correspondence with
Governmental Entities in the Companys possession relating to compliance
with Environmental Laws.

prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and its Representatives may furnish
non-public information regarding the Company to any person and may negotiate
and participate in discussions and negotiations with such person concerning an

material violation of this Section 5.2 by the Company, submitted a _bona fide_
written proposal to the Company relating to any such Acquisition Proposal
which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor, is or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. From and after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall within twenty-four (24) hours notify the Parent in writing in
the event that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of
business and, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors,
unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall provide Parent within such twenty-four (24) hour period with the
identity of such Person and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request (or, where such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a description
of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or

Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
within twenty-four (24) hours notify the Parent in writing if the Company
determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would
restrict the Companys ability to provide such information to Parent, and, if
the Company is a party to any agreement that would prohibit the Company from
providing such information to Parent, prior to providing non-public
information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with, the
counterparty to such agreement, the Company will obtain approval from the
counterparty to such agreement to allow the Company to provide such
information to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or
grant permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement
to which it or any of the Company Subsidiaries is or becomes a party;
provided, however, that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries may respond
to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal submitted to the Company by a party
that is bound by a standstill agreement and may decline to enforce or cause to
be enforced its rights under such standstill agreement relating to the
submission of such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if, in either case, the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to so respond or failure to decline to take such
action, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law. The Company will promptly provide to the Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or
made available pursuant to this Section 5.2(b) which was not previously
provided or made available to the Parent.



 

33 (c) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Parent or Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) enter into any written agreement providing
for the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company receives a written,  _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal from a third party, (ii) a material breach by the Company
of this Section 5.2 has not contributed to the making of an Acquisition
Proposal and (iii) the Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to
all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which have been offered
by Parent (if any) pursuant to this Section 5.2, the Company Board of
Directors may, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or
substantially concurrently with such termination the Company (1) pays the fee
required by and pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 and (2) immediately
following such termination enters into a binding definitive agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company Board of Directors may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (B) unless (1) the Company shall not have breached in any
material respect this Section 5.2, (2) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to the Parent, at least three (3) business days in advance
(the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys intention to take such action with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, (3) prior to effecting such Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a
definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during
the Notice Period, negotiate with the Parent in good faith (to the extent the
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (4) following any negotiation described
in the immediately preceding clause (3), such Acquisition Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to
the terms of the Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to the Parent and
to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.2 with respect to such new
written notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on
the date of such new notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if fewer than
three (3) business days remains before the then-scheduled expiration date of
the Offer, the Notice Period with respect to the Company Board of Directors
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause
(A) shall equal twenty-four (24) hours, _provided_ , _however_ , that, in such
a circumstance, the Notice Period with respect to the Company terminating this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall remain three (3)
business days. Any Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval
of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other state Law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including each of the Offer and the Merger or
by the tender and voting Agreements with Principal Stockholders. For purposes
of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " is a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal to acquire at least fifty percent (50%) of the equity
securities of the Company or at least fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated
total assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,  



 

34  (A) on terms which the Company Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisors) to be
more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than
the Offer and the Merger, and (B) which the Company Board of Directors has
determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial
and legal advisors) to be reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board of Directors may withdraw
or modify the Company Board Recommendation in the absence of a Superior
Proposal if the Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to so withdraw or modify
the Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations of the Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board
of Directors shall not so withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation
unless the Company has (A) provided to the Parent at least three (3) business
days prior written notice (or such shorter period as remains prior to the
then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer) advising the Parent that the
Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefore in reasonable detail and (B) during such three (3) business
day period, or shorter period, as the case may be, if requested by the Parent,
engaged in good faith negotiations with the Parent to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that obviates the need or reason for the withdrawal or
modification.

(f) The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2) business
days after the date of this Agreement) demand that each person that, as of the
date of this Agreement, has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with a potential Acquisition Proposal return (or destroy, to the
extent permitted by the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement)
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such individual or entity
by or on behalf of the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

SECTION 6  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1.  _Proxy Statement_. If required by the Exchange Act, the Company shall,
as soon as practicable following the expiration of the Offer, prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company,
Parent and Sub shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
the adoption of this Agreement by the required vote of the holders of the
outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ") there shall occur
any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders
such an amendment or supplement to the extent required by applicable Law.
The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after filing with
the SEC. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Proxy
Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors
in favor of the Merger.

6.2. _Meeting of Stockholders of the Company_. If, following the Tender
Completion Time, the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares
is required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger, the Company
shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock
Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as
promptly as practicable, a Special Meeting. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Tender Completion Time_ " means the latest to occur of (x) the
Acceptance Time, (y) the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares or the
failure by Sub to exercise the Top-Up Option during the exercise period
provided in Section 1.10 and (z) if at least one subsequent offering period is
commenced by Sub, the expiration of the last subsequent offering period
related to the Offer.



 

35 6.3. _Nasdaq; Post-Closing SEC Reports_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with the Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of The Nasdaq Stock Market to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from The Nasdaq Stock
Market and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act promptly
after the Effective Time. Parent will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a Form 25
on the Closing Date and (b) a Form 15 on the first business day that is at
least ten (10) days after the date the Form 25 is filed (such period between
the Form 25 filing date and the Form 15 filing date, the " _Delisting Period_
"). If the Surviving Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file
any reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the
Company will deliver to Parent at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing a substantially final draft of any such reports reasonably likely to
be required to be filed during the Delisting Period (" _Post-Closing SEC
Reports_ "). The Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the Company pursuant to
this Section 6.3 will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) comply in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable Laws.

6.4. _Access to Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled, through its employees and representatives, to have such access to
the assets, properties, business and operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with
Parents investigation of the Company with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any such investigation and examination shall be
conducted at reasonable times during business hours upon reasonable advance
notice and under reasonable circumstances so as to minimize disruption to or
impairment of the Companys business. No investigation by Parent shall
diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement. The Company shall
furnish the representatives of Parent during such period with all such
information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the Company
as such representatives may reasonably request and cause its officers,
employees, consultants, agents, accountants and attorneys to cooperate fully
with such representatives in connection with such investigation. The
information and documents so provided shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to
violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work
product privilege.

6.5. _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning the Offer and
the Merger shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, subject to the
other terms of this Agreement (including Section 5.2), so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither Parent, Sub nor the Company will disseminate
any press release or other announcement concerning the Merger, the Offer or
this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any
third party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with
The Nasdaq Stock Market, without the prior consent of each of the other
parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
without prior consent of the other party, each party (a) may communicate
information that is not confidential to the other party with financial
analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner consistent with its
past practice in compliance with applicable Law and (b) may disseminate
material substantially similar to material included in a press release or
other document previously approved for external distribution by the other
parties. Each party agrees to promptly make available to the other parties
copies of any written communications made without prior consultation with the
other parties.

6.6. _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Sub and
the Company shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, application or submission  



 

36  of other documents required under applicable Law by any Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation: (i)
Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal Trade Commission
and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice as
required by the HSR Act, (ii) filings required by the merger notification or
control Laws of the foreign jurisdictions listed on _Annex I-A_ , and (iii)
any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable state or securities or "blue sky" Laws and the securities Laws of
any foreign country, or any other applicable Laws or rules and regulations of
any Governmental Entity relating to the Offer and the Merger. Each of Parent
and the Company will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing
with any Governmental Entity under this Section 6.6 to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Laws of any Governmental Entity.

(b) Each of Parent, Sub, and the Company shall promptly supply the other with
any information which may be reasonably required in order to effectuate any
filings or application pursuant to this Section 6.6.

(c) Each of Parent, Sub and the Company will notify the others promptly upon
the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity
in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by
any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any
filings made pursuant to, or information provided to comply in all material
respects with, any applicable Laws and rules and regulations of any
Governmental Entity. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section
6.6(a), Parent, Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform
the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

(d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, including complying in all material respects with all applicable Laws
and with all rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity and using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the causing of all
the conditions set forth in SECTION 7 and in _Annex I_ hereto to be satisfied
and to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the obtaining of all reasonably
requested actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of
all reasonably requested registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any),
(iii) the obtaining of all reasonably requested consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the
execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to carry out fully the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Offer, the Merger,
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
will use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, approval, or waiver
with respect to the Material Contracts such that no party will have a
reasonable basis to maintain that the representations and warranties in
Section 3.11 and clause "(ii)" of Section 3.19 are not true and correct.
Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other subsidiary of Parent to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise
dispose of any assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or
agree or proffer to sell, hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any
assets or conduct their business in a specified manner, or permit or agree to
the sale, holding separate,  



 

37  licensing or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent or the Company, whether as a
condition to obtaining any approval from, or to avoid potential litigation or
administrative action by, a Governmental Entity or any other person or for any
other reason.

6.7. _Notification of Certain Matters; Litigation_. Each party shall give
prompt notice to the other parties of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event of which such party has knowledge the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which would cause any representation or warranty made by such party in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from
the date hereof to the Effective Time, (b) any Offer Condition of which such
party has knowledge is unsatisfied in any material respect as of any scheduled
Expiration Date, and (c) any material failure of such party or any of its
Representatives of which such party has knowledge to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; _provided_ __, _however __,_ that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or the
remedies available to the party receiving such notification. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after it
has notice of any of the following notify the Parent of (i) any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings instituted or
threatened against the Company or any of its directors, officers or
Affiliates, including by any stockholder of the Company, before any court or
Governmental Entity, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in connection with such transactions.
The Company shall consult with the Parent regarding the defense or settlement
of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings and shall
consider the Parents views with respect to such actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings.

6.8. _Indemnification_.

(a) Parent agrees that any rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors or officers of the Company and the
directors or officers of each Company Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified Parties_
" and, each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in their respective
organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to
matters occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Time shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
after the Acceptance Time, and Parent guarantees any such obligations of
the Surviving Corporation. During such period, Parent shall not, nor shall it
permit the Surviving Corporation to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions for indemnification in any manner that would materially and
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time on or
prior to the Acceptance Time were directors or officers of the Company or
directors or officers of any of Company Subsidiary in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Time (including, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such
modification is required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
any claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the Acceptance Time
or within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect
of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all
such claims.

(b) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO Insurance_") with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium
therefor would not be in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such two hundred percent
(200%), the " _Maximum Premium_ "), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended
reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a "
_Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ")  



 

38  and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term,
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Surviving Corporation taking
any actions in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Parent shall be provided the
opportunity to purchase, in lieu thereof, a substitute policy with the same
coverage limits and substantially similar terms as in the Reporting Tail
Endorsement proposed to be purchased by the Surviving Corporation. If the
Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six (6) year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance.

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section
6.8 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.8 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.8 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

6.9. _Directors_.

(a) Promptly upon the payment by Sub for any Shares accepted by Sub for
payment pursuant to the Offer at the Acceptance Time, which Shares represent
at least a majority of the issued and outstanding Shares pursuant to the
Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the
Company Board of Directors as will give Parent, subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board
of Directors equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, which is the product of (x) the total number of directors
on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (y) the percentage that (I) such
number of Shares so accepted for payment and paid for by Sub plus the number
of Shares otherwise owned by Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent
bears to (II) the number of such Shares outstanding, and the Company shall, at
such time, cause Parents designees to be so elected; _provided __,_ _however_
__, that in the event that Parent s designees are appointed or elected to
the Company Board of Directors, until the Effective Time, the Company Board of
Directors shall have at least three (3) directors who are directors on the
date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company (the "
_Independent Directors_ "); and _provided_ , _further_ , that, in such event,
if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below three (3) for
any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent Directors (or Independent
Director, if there shall be only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate
persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain,
the other directors shall designate three persons to fill such vacancies who
are not officers or affiliates of the Company, Parent or Sub, and such persons
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
At such time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, also cause persons
elected or designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage (rounded up
to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors of (i) each
committee of the Company Board of Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or
similar body) of each of the Companys Subsidiaries, and (iii) each committee
(or similar body) of each such board, in each case only to the extent
required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the
Shares are listed. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all
action requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election, including
mailing to its stockholders the Information Statement containing the
information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall make such mailing with the
mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Sub shall have provided to the
Company on a timely basis all information required to be included in the
Information Statement with respect to Subs designees). In connection with the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of Sub, either increase
the size of the Company Board of Directors or obtain the resignation of such
number of its current directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Subs
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board of Directors
as provided above.



 

39 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Parents designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors (or if only one
(1) exists, then the vote of such Independent Director) shall be required to
(i) amend or terminate this Agreement by the Company, (ii) exercise or waive
any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action
would materially and adversely affect holders of Shares other than Parent or
Sub, (iii) amend the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, or
(iv) take any other action of the Company Board of Directors under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ __, _however __,_ that if there shall be no Independent Directors
as a result of such persons deaths, disabilities or refusal to serve, then
such actions may be effected by majority vote of the entire Company Board of
Directors.

6.10. _401(k)_. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not (i) make any discretionary contribution to the Companys 401(k)
plan, other than employer matching contributions at the rate in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, or (ii) make any required
contribution to the Companys 401(k) plan in Shares. If requested by Parent in
writing at least 10 days prior to the scheduled expiration date of the Offer,
the Company shall terminate the Companys 401(k) plan immediately prior to
the scheduled expiration date of the Offer.

6.11. _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

(a) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2009, Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) continue certain Plans, (ii)
permit employees of the Company and any Company Subsidiary who remain in the
employment with Parent or Surviving Corporation or their respective
subsidiaries following the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") while
they remain so employed by Parent or Surviving Corporation or their respective
subsidiaries, and as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in
the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including without
limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code and any severance, vacation, sick, personal time off plans or
programs and excluding any equity compensation or bonus plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements) of Parent or its Affiliates, or (iii) a
combination of clauses (i) and (ii), in all cases, such employee benefit
plans, programs or policies shall be substantially comparable in the aggregate
to those provided to such employees immediately preceding the Effective Time
(it being understood that (y) from the Effective Time through December 31,
2009, Parent shall provide to Company employees entitled to benefits under a
Company bonus plan total cash compensation (base salary and bonus program)
that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the total cash
compensation such employees had prior to the Effective Date and, for this
purpose, the bonus compensation payable under the Company bonus plans for
periods after the Effective Time is assumed to be payable at the target amount
set forth in the applicable Company bonus plan and (z) any bonus compensation
payable to Company employees shall be payable at such time as provided for in
the applicable Company bonus plan).

(b) To the extent Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents participate in its or its Affiliates employee
benefit plans, program or policies following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, recognize the
prior service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including prior
service with predecessor employers where such prior service is recognized by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of each Continuing Employee in connection with all employee
benefit plans, programs or policies of Parent or its Affiliates in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and determination of level of benefits (but not (A)
for purposes of vesting stock options and other equity awards, (B) for the
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or (C) to
the extent that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits).

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their  



 

40  eligible dependents to the extent such Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents were not subject to such preexisting conditions and
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under the comparable Plans as of
the time immediately preceding the Effective Time.

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any employee by Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
under any benefit plan which Company, Parent or Surviving Corporation may
maintain.

therein) except where the failure to be so true and correct does not, and

not been cured within twenty (20) days following notice by the Company; or

(e) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) (A) the

Schedule 14D-9 the Company is prepared to file, without further revisions,
upon commencement of the Offer; or

(i) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall have

8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

(a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 hereof will be
effective immediately upon the delivery of a written notice of the terminating
party to the other party hereto and, if then due, payment of the  



 

42  Termination Fee. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided
in Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and be of no further force or effect and there shall be no liability on
the part of Parent, Sub or the Company (or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives), except as set
forth in the last sentence of Section 6.4, SECTION 8 and SECTION 9, each of
which shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement; _provided_ __, _however_ , that (i) nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for fraud or intentional breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (it being understood that the failure of Parent or Sub to accept for
payment and pay for the Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer promptly following the Expiration Date in the event that all Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived, as of the
Expiration Date shall be deemed an intentional breach by Parent and Sub
pursuant to this Agreement), and (ii) no termination of this Agreement shall
in any way affect the parties rights or obligations with respect to any
Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer prior to such termination.

(b) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e),
the Company shall promptly pay Parent a termination fee (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") of $17,000,000, but in no event later than two (2) business days after
the date of receipt of Parents termination notice. If the Company intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it shall, substantially
concurrent with such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee. If Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) due to an intentional or
knowing material breach by the Company of a covenant or agreement of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, and prior to such time an Acquisition
Proposal has been made that has not been withdrawn prior to the time of such
termination, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee concurrent
with the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal that is consummated prior to
the first anniversary of the date of such termination or for which the
definitive written agreement providing for the consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal has been executed no later than the first
anniversary of the date of such termination (it being understood that for
purposes of this Section 8.2(b), the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced with "fifty
percent (50%)." All amounts due hereunder shall be payable by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to such account as Parent may designate in writing
to the Company. If the Company fails to promptly make any payment required
under this Section 8.2(b) and Parent commences a suit to collect such payment,
the Company shall indemnify Parent for its fees and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit and shall
pay interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of Bank of America
(or its successors or assigns) in effect on the date the payment was payable
pursuant to this Section 8.2(b).

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.2, all fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

8.4.  _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and
all respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the
Company contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, but after the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment shall be made which decreases
the Merger Consideration and, after the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further
approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

8.5. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party or any conditions to its own obligations, in
each case only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are
intended for its benefit; provided _,_ that any such extension or waiver shall
be binding upon a party only if such extension or waiver is set forth in a
writing executed by such party.

9.3. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Annexes
and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein)
contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and related transactions, and supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, among the parties with respect thereto, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement and the tender and voting agreements with the
Principal Stockholders.

9.4. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions arising under or in
connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that  



 

44  might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Laws of the
respective jurisdictions of incorporation of each of the parties shall govern
the relative rights, obligations, powers, duties and other internal affairs of
such party and its board of directors.

9.5. _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties, except that Sub may assign, in its sole discretion and without
the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and one or more direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent, (iii) to one or more direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent or (iv) any direct or indirect
holder of five percent (5%) or more of the capital stock of Parent or
any subsidiary thereof (each, an " _Assignee_ "). Any such Assignee may
thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other
party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or
more additional Assignees; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with
any assignment to an Assignee, Parent and Sub (and the assignor, if
applicable) shall agree to remain liable for the performance by Parent and Sub
(and such assignor, if applicable) of their obligations hereunder, including
the obligation to pay in full for all Shares validly tendered into the Offer
and the Merger Consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that in connection with any
assignment under this Section 9.5(a) that would increase the amount, if any,
required to be deducted or withheld from amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to the holders or former holders of
Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs under the Tax Law of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, such assignment shall be null and void unless
Parent, Sub and the applicable assignee specifically agree that the last
sentence of Section 2.6 shall also apply with respect to such increase such
that each holder or former holder of Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs
shall receive the same amount that would otherwise have been received if no
such assignment been made. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

(b) Other than Section 6.8, which shall confer third party beneficiary rights
to the parties identified therein, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than Parent, Sub
and the Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

9.6. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.

9.7. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The
parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
invalid or unenforceable provision.

9.8. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Sub irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other
party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in
the state courts of the State of Delaware or, the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware, and each of the Company, Parent and Sub hereby
irrevocably submits  



 

45  with regard to any action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

9.9. _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence with respect to the
performance of this Agreement.

 

9.10. _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Sub to comply in all respects
with each of its representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings pursuant to or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a material inducement to the
Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Sub of each of its covenants, obligations and
undertakings pursuant to or otherwise in connection with this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any breach of,
or other failure to perform, any such representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation, agreement or undertaking of Sub shall also be deemed to be a
breach or failure to perform by Parent, and the Company shall have the right,
exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies
it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against
either or both of Parent and Sub in the first instance.

9.11. _Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm
or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that in addition to other remedies the
other party shall be entitled to an injunction without posting a bond or other
undertaking restraining any violation or threatened violation of
the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any action shall be
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the Agreement, no party shall
allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate
remedy at Law.

 

9.12. _Rules of Construction; Certain Definitions_.

exclusive and "include", "includes" and "including" are not limiting; (ii)

Entity (i) seeking to prohibit or impose any material limitations on Parents
or Subs ownership or operation (or that of any of their respective
Subsidiaries) of all or any material portion of the Companys or the Companys
Subsidiaries businesses or assets, taken as a whole, or to compel Parent or

Section 3.5 shall be deemed untrue if it fails to be true and correct in all
respects, (y) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Section 3.3 or in Section 3.8 (other than the first sentence thereof) shall be
deemed untrue if it fails to be true and correct in all material respects (it

(other than any representation or warranty referred to in clauses (x) or (y)

qualification based on the defined term "Company Material Adverse Effect"
embedded in any such representation or warranty);

dated as of the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this _Annex I_ have not
occurred; or

NONE Annex II

FORM OF TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT

_TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT_

THIS TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated May 7, 2009, is
entered into between Covidien Group S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg company ("
_Parent_ "), Covidien Delaware Corp., a Delaware corporation and direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and 
, (" _Stockholder_ "), with respect to (a) the shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the " _Share_ s"), of VNUS Medical Technologies,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), (b) all securities
exchangeable, exercisable or convertible into Shares, and (c) any securities
issued or exchanged with respect to such Shares upon any recapitalization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation, spin-off, partial or complete
liquidation, stock dividend, split-up or combination of the securities of the
Company or upon any other change in the Companys capital structure, in each
case whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the Stockholder (collectively,
the " _Securities_ ").

_W I T N E S S E T H:_

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, other than to lower the price to be paid in the Offer or Merger,
the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Sub has agreed to make a cash
tender offer as described therein and thereafter merge with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") with the result that the Company becomes a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner
and has the power to dispose of the Securities set forth on  _Schedule I_
hereto and has the power to vote the Shares set forth thereon, except as
otherwise set forth on _Schedule I_ ;

WHEREAS, Parent and Sub desire to enter into this Agreement in connection with
their efforts to consummate the acquisition of the Company;

[ _For Chief Executive Officer only_ ] WHEREAS, Stockholder, as an executive
and stockholder of the Company, has obtained extensive and valuable knowledge,
expertise and confidential information concerning the Business (as defined
below), and has valuable business contacts with clients and potential clients
of the Business and with professionals in the industry in which the Company
operates; the Companys reputation and goodwill are an integral part of the
Companys business success throughout the areas where it conducts the Business
and if Stockholder deprives Parent or Sub of any of the Companys goodwill or
in any manner uses its reputation and goodwill in competition with Parent,
Sub or the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Sub will be deprived of the
benefits it has bargained for pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement; since Stockholder has the ability to compete with Parent, Sub and
the Surviving Corporation in the operation of the Business, Parent and Sub
therefore desire that Stockholder enter into this Agreement; and but for
Stockholders entry into this Agreement, Parent and Sub would not have entered
into the Merger Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have the
meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration of the
mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained herein
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Certain Covenants_. 

1.1 _Lock-Up_. Subject to Section 1.5, except as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the date
hereof and the Termination Date, Stockholder will not (a) directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or
otherwise dispose of or limit its right to vote in any manner any of the
Securities, or agree to do any of the foregoing, or (b) take any action which
would have the effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing
its  obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
connection with any transfer not involving or relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Stockholder may transfer any
or all of the Securities as follows: (i) in the case of a Stockholder that is
an entity, to any subsidiary, partner or member of Stockholder, and (ii) in
the case of an individual Stockholder, to Stockholders spouse, ancestors,
descendants or any trust for any of their benefits or to a charitable trust;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, prior to and as a condition to
the effectiveness of such transfer, (A) each person to which any of such
Securities or any interest in any of such Securities is or may be transferred
(1) shall have executed and delivered to Parent and Sub a counterpart to this
Agreement pursuant to which such person shall be bound by all of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, and (2) shall have agreed in writing with
Parent and Sub to hold such Securities or interest in such Securities subject
to all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and (B) this Agreement
shall be the legal, valid and binding agreement of such person, enforceable
against such person in accordance with its terms.

1.2 _No Solicitation_. Between the date hereof and the Termination Date,
neither the Stockholder nor any director, officer, agent, representative,
employee, affiliate, advisor, attorney, accountant or associate of Stockholder
or those of its subsidiaries (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall,
directly or indirectly, take any action that the Company is prohibited from
taking pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement.

1.3 _Certain Events_. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will
attach to the Securities and will be binding upon any person to which legal or
beneficial ownership of any or all of the Securities passes, whether by
operation of Law or otherwise, including without limitation,
the Stockholders successors or assigns. This Agreement and the obligations
hereunder will also attach to any additional Shares or other Securities of the
Company issued to or acquired by the Stockholder.

1.4 _Grant of Proxy; Voting Agreement_.

(a) The Stockholder has revoked or terminated any proxies, voting agreements
or similar arrangements previously given or entered into with respect to the
Securities and hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as proxy for Stockholder to
vote the Shares as to which Stockholder has voting power for Stockholder and
in Stockholders name, place and stead, at any annual or special meeting of
the stockholders of the Company, as applicable, or at any
adjournment thereof, whether before or after the Acceptance Date (as defined
in the Merger Agreement), solely for the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
the approval of the Merger. Parent hereby acknowledges that the proxy granted
hereby shall not be effective for any other purpose. The parties acknowledge
and agree that neither Parent, nor Parents successors, assigns, subsidiaries,
divisions, employees, officers, directors, stockholders, agents and affiliates
shall owe any duty to, whether in law or otherwise, or incur any liability of
any kind whatsoever, including without limitation, with respect to any and all
claims, losses, demands, causes of action, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) and compensation of any kind or nature whatsoever
to the Stockholder in connection with or as a result of any voting by Parent
of the Shares subject to the irrevocable proxy hereby granted to Parent at any
annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company for the purpose
set forth herein.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing grant to Parent of the irrevocable proxy,
if Parent elects not to exercise its rights to vote the Shares pursuant to the
irrevocable proxy, Stockholder agrees to vote the Shares during the term of
this Agreement in favor of or give its consent to, as applicable, a proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Company.

(c) This irrevocable proxy shall not be terminated by any act of the
Stockholder or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of the
Stockholder or by the occurrence of any other event or events (including,
without limiting the foregoing, the termination of any trust or estate for
which Stockholder is acting as a fiduciary or fiduciaries or the dissolution
or liquidation of any corporation or partnership). If between the execution
hereof and the Termination Date, Stockholder should die or become
incapacitated, or if any trust or estate holding the Securities should be
terminated, or if any corporation or partnership holding the Securities should
be dissolved or liquidated, or if any other such  



 

2  similar event or events shall occur before the Termination Date,
certificates representing the Securities shall be delivered by or on behalf of
Stockholder in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and this Agreement, and actions taken by Parent hereunder shall be
as valid as if such death, incapacity, termination, dissolution, liquidation
or other similar event or events had not occurred, regardless of whether or
not Parent has received notice of such death, incapacity, termination,
dissolution, liquidation or other event.

1.5 _Tender of Securities_. Stockholder agrees, in exchange for the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement, to (a) tender any Shares
owned of record by Stockholder or for which Stockholder has sole dispositive
power prior to the Commencement Date to Sub in the Offer not later than five
(5) business days following the Commencement Date, and (b) tender any Shares
acquired by Stockholder after the Commencement Date to Sub in the Offer not
later than the earlier of (i) five (5) business days following the acquisition
of such Shares or (ii) the Acceptance Date, and Stockholder shall not withdraw
any Shares so tendered under clauses (a) and (b) above unless the Offer is
terminated or this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that Stockholder shall not be required, for
purposes of this Agreement, to exercise any unexercised Company Options held
by such Stockholder or tender any Shares granted to such Stockholder under an
employee benefit plan of the Company which are unvested and subject to any
risk of forfeiture, and Stockholder shall not have any obligation under
this Section 1.5 to tender such Stockholders Shares into the Offer if that
tender could cause such Stockholder to incur liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act.

1.6 _Option_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Stockholder
hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Option_ ") to purchase
all of the right, title and interest of Stockholder in and to Stockholders
Securities with a price per share equal to the Offer Price. Parent may
exercise the Option in whole, but not in part, if, but only if, (i) Sub has
acquired Shares pursuant to the Offer and (ii) Stockholder has failed
to tender into the Offer any Shares or shall have withdrawn the tender of any
Shares into the Offer in breach of this Agreement. Parent may exercise the
Option at any time within the sixty (60) days following the date when such
Option first becomes exercisable.

(b) In the event that Parent is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option,
Parent shall send a written notice to Stockholder specifying the place and
the date for the closing of such purchase, which date shall be not more than
sixty (60) days after the date of such notice; provided that in the event that
prior notification to, or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required in
connection with the exercise of the Option or there shall be in effect any
preliminary or final injunction or other order issued by any Governmental
Entity prohibiting the exercise of the Option, the period of time during
which the date of the closing may be fixed shall be extended until the tenth
(10th) day following the last date on which all required approvals shall have
been obtained, all required waiting periods shall have expired or been
terminated and any such prohibition shall have been vacated, terminated or
waived.

(c) At the closing of the purchase of Stockholders Securities pursuant to
exercise of the Option, simultaneously with the payment by Parent of the
purchase price for Stockholders Securities, such Stockholder shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to the Sub certificates representing Securities
duly endorsed to Parent or accompanied by stock powers or other transfer
documents duly executed by the Company in blank, together with any necessary
stock transfer stamps properly affixed, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

(d) Parent, Sub or the Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Section
1.6 to a holder of Securities such amounts as are required to be withheld
under the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder or any other Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, and such deduction and
withholding would have been required were Parent incorporated or organized in
the United States or a subdivision thereof, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the  



 

3  holder of the Securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. To the extent any amounts are required to be deducted and
withheld under the Tax Law of a jurisdiction outside the United States, and
such deduction would not have been required were Parent incorporated or
organized in the United States or a subdivision thereof, additional amounts
shall be paid as necessary to ensure that the Stockholder receives the same
amount that would otherwise have been received as if no such deduction and
withholding had been made.

1.7 _Public Announcement_. Stockholder shall consult with Parent before
issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the approval of
Parent, except as may be required by Law, including any filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). This Section 1.7
shall terminate and be null and void upon the earlier of (a) the Termination
Date and (b) consummation of the Merger.

1.8 _Disclosure_. Stockholder hereby authorizes Parent and Sub to publish and
disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC, The Nasdaq
Stock Market or any other national securities exchange and in the Offer
Documents and, if necessary, the Proxy Statement (including all documents and
schedules filed with the SEC in connection with either of the
foregoing), Stockholders identity and ownership of the Securities and the
nature of Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under
this Agreement. Parent and Sub hereby authorize Stockholder to make such
disclosure or filings as may be required by the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock
Market or any other national securities exchange.

1.9 _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_. [ _For Chief Executive Officer
only_ ]

(a) Stockholder agrees for a period of three (3) years immediately following
the Closing Date, Stockholder will not, directly or indirectly, own, manage,
control, be employed by, operate, perform, have any interest in or otherwise
be engaged in or concerned with any business that develops,
manufactures, sells, markets or distributes, anywhere in the world, products
or devices intended for the treatment of venous reflux disease that compete
with any products or devices being developed, manufactured, sold, marketed or
distributed by or on behalf of the Company as of the date hereof, including
without limitation any such products or devices that are under development as
of the date hereof but not yet offered for sale by the Company (the "
_Business_ ") ; provided, however, that (i) Stockholder shall be permitted to
work for a division, entity, or subgroup of any of such competing business so
long as such division, entity, or subgroup does not engage in a business
(including, without limitation, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales
or technical or sales support) that makes such entity compete with the
Business and Stockholder does not facilitate, directly or indirectly,
competition with the Business, and (ii) Stockholder may also receive and hold
in such situation equity in such entity that he obtains in connection with
such service on the same basis as other employees similarly situated to
Stockholder; _provided_ , _further_ , that Stockholder shall not be prohibited
from owning not more than 1% of any class of securities of any entity,
whether such securities are publicly traded on a recognized securities
exchange or are privately held. Stockholder expressly acknowledges that the
foregoing geographic area is reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of the Company, especially given the special
information and knowledge held by Stockholder. Further, Stockholder
acknowledges that the Company would not proceed with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement without receiving the full scope of the
protections provided for hereunder and that any lesser geographic restriction
would not adequately protect the Company. Stockholder also agrees that for
such period, the Stockholder shall not in any way make any negative or
disparaging statements or communications about the Surviving Corporation, its
products or business); conversely, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
officers thereof agree to not make any negative or disparaging comments or
communications regarding Stockholder for such period.

(b) Stockholder agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing Date, Stockholder will not, directly or indirectly, induce any
employee to terminate his or her employment with the Surviving Corporation or
hire any such employee,  _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not
prohibit  



 

4  Stockholder from making general solicitations through advertising, internet
postings or other similar solicitations not targeted at employees of
the Surviving Corporation, or from hiring any employee of the Surviving
Corporation who responds to any such general solicitation without
encouragement or inducement by the Stockholder.

(c) Stockholder acknowledges that the restrictions on his activities under
this Agreement are necessary for the reasonable protection of Parent and Sub
and constitute a material inducement to Parent and Sub entering into and
performing under the Merger Agreement. Stockholder further acknowledges,
stipulates and agrees that a breach of any of such obligations and agreements
will result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to Parent and Sub for
which there will be no adequate remedy at law and further agrees that in the
event of any breach of said obligations and agreements, Parent, Sub and their
successors and assigns will be entitled to injunctive relief and to such
other relief as is proper under the circumstances.

(d) It is the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that the
provisions of this Section 1.9 shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in
which enforcement is sought. If any covenant set forth in this Section 1.9 is
determined by any court to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too
great a period of time or over too great a geographic area, or by reason of
its being too extensive in any other respect, such covenant shall be
interpreted to extend only for the longest period of time and over the
greatest geographic area, and to otherwise have the broadest application as
shall be enforceable.

2\. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Sub, as of the date hereof and as of
the date Sub purchases Shares pursuant to the Offer, that:

2.1 _Ownership_. As of the date hereof, Stockholder holds of record or
beneficially the Securities set forth on _Schedule I_ , in each case, except
as set forth on _Schedule I_ , free and clear of all liabilities, claims,
liens, options, proxies, charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind
or character whatsoever, other than those arising under the securities laws
or under the Companys governance documents (collectively, " _Liens_ "). At
the time Sub purchases Shares pursuant to the Offer, Stockholder will transfer
and convey to Sub good and marketable title to the Shares included in the
Securities, free and clear of all Liens created by or arising through
Stockholder.

2.2 _Authorization_. Stockholder has all requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and has sole voting power and sole power of disposition,
with respect to the Securities with no restrictions on its voting rights or
rights of disposition pertaining thereto, except as set forth in the
Securities or pursuant to applicable community property laws. Stockholder has
duly executed and delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal,
valid and binding agreement of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited
by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity. If the Stockholder is married and the Securities constitute community
property, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Stockholders spouse, and this Agreement is a legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Stockholders spouse, enforceable against the
Stockholders spouse in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
enforceability may be limited by the effect of applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and the effect of general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at Law or in equity.

2.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) require the
Stockholder to file or register with, or obtain any permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any governmental agency, authority, administrative or
regulatory body, court or other tribunal, foreign or domestic, or any other
entity other than filings with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, or (b)
violate, or cause a breach of or default under, or conflict with any  



 

5  contract, agreement or understanding, any Law binding upon the Stockholder,
except for such violations, breaches, defaults or conflicts which are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have an adverse
effect on the Stockholders ability to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, no proceedings are pending which, if
adversely determined, will have an adverse effect on the Stockholders
ability to vote or dispose of any of the Securities.

2.4 _Stockholder Has Adequate Information_. Stockholder is a sophisticated
seller with respect to the Securities and has adequate information concerning
the business and financial condition of the Company to make an informed
decision regarding the sale of the Securities and has independently and
without reliance upon either Sub or Parent and based on such information as
Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that neither Sub nor
Parent has made and neither makes any representation or warranty, whether
express or implied, of any kind or character except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that the agreements contained
herein with respect to the Securities held by Stockholder are irrevocable
(prior to the Termination Date), and that Stockholder shall have no recourse
to the Securities, Parent or Sub, except with respect to breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

2.5 _No Setoff_. The Stockholder has no liability or obligation related to or
in connection with the Securities other than the obligations to Parent and Sub
as set forth in this Agreement.

2.6 _No Amounts Payable to Stockholder_. Except as disclosed in the Merger
Agreement or _Schedule 2.6_ of this Agreement, there are no amounts due or
payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the Stockholder or any of
its affiliates or associates in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement or otherwise (other than any
payments required under the Merger Agreement solely in exchange for
equity securities of the Company or payments, if any, to be made pursuant to
Plans disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule).

3.  _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub_. Parent and Sub hereby
represent and warrant to Stockholder, as of the date hereof that:

3.1 _Authorization_. Parent and Sub have all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and Sub have duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Sub in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be
limited by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity.

3.2 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate, or
cause a breach of or default under, any contract or agreement, any statute or
law, or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any governmental
agency, authority, administrative or regulatory body, court or other
tribunal, foreign or domestic, or any other entity or any arbitration award
binding upon Parent or Sub, except for such violations, breaches or defaults
which are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either
Parents or Subs ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement.

4.  _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The respective
representations and warranties of Stockholder, Parent and Sub contained herein
shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by
the other party hereto. 

5\. _Specific Performance_. Stockholder acknowledges that Sub and Parent will
be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a
violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Stockholder which are
contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any
other remedies which may be available to Sub and Parent upon the breach
by Stockholder of such covenants and agreements, Sub and Parent shall have
the right to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened
breach of such covenants or agreements or otherwise to obtain specific
performance of any of such covenants or agreements.



 

6 6\. _Miscellaneous_.

6.1 _Term_. [ _Chief Executive Officer only:_ Except for the obligations set
forth in Section 1.9 hereof, which obligations survive for the period set
forth in Section 1.9,] this Agreement and all obligations hereunder shall
terminate upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the Outside Date (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), (c) the date of any modification, waiver or
amendment to the Merger Agreement in a manner that reduces the amount and form
of consideration payable thereunder to the Stockholder, and (d) the
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 thereof (the
earliest of (a), (b), (c) and (d), the " _Termination Date_ "). Upon
termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing
set forth in this Section 6.1 shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement prior to termination hereof, and (ii) the
provisions of this Article 6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

6.2 _Capacity as a Stockholder; Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary: (a) the Stockholder makes no agreement or
understanding herein in any capacity other than in the Stockholders capacity
as a record holder and beneficial owner of Securities, and not in such
Stockholders capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of Company Subsidiaries or in such Stockholders capacity as a trustee or
fiduciary of any employee benefit plan or trust, and (b) nothing herein will
be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by the Stockholder or
any Representative of the Stockholder, as applicable, serving on the Company
Board of Directors or on the board of directors of any Company Subsidiary or
as an officer or fiduciary of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
employee benefit plan or trust, acting in such persons capacity as a
director, officer, trustee and/or fiduciary.

in connection with this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto warrants and
covenants to the others that it will bear all claims for brokerage fees

benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
representatives and permitted successors and assigns.

the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be amended

6.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

6.7 _Assignment_. Without limitation to Section 1.1, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No party may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of Parent and Sub may freely assign its rights to another direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Sub without such prior written
approval but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder; and provided, further, that in connection with any
assignment under this Section 6.7 that would increase the amount, if any,
required to be deducted or withheld from amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to Stockholder under the Tax Law of a
jurisdiction outside the United States, such assignment shall be null and
void unless Parent, Sub and the applicable assignee specifically agree that
the last sentence of Section 1.6(d) shall also apply with respect to such
increase such that Stockholder shall receive the same amount that would
otherwise have been received if no such assignment been made. Any purported
assignment requiring consent without such consent shall be void.
