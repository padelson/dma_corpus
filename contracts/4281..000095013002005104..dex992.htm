(g) In addition to the adjustment to Net Working Capital provided in
Sections 2.7(d) and (e), the Buyer shall pay to the Parent as additional
Consideration the amount of the Remaining Cash, if any, reflected on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet.



(h) If the amount of the Estimated Transferred Subsidiary Debt is less than
the amount of the Actual Transferred Subsidiary Debt then the Parent shall
remit to the Buyer the difference between such amounts. If the amount of the
Estimated Transferred Subsidiary Debt is greater than the amount of the Actual
Transferred Subsidiary Debt then the Buyer shall remit to the Parent the
difference between such amounts. 



(i) Unless otherwise required by Law, the parties shall treat any adjustment
made pursuant to Sections 2.7(d), 2.7(e), 2.7(g) and 2.7(h) as an adjustment

SECTION 2.8 _Earn-Out._



(a) Beginning with calendar year 2003, the Parent shall be entitled to
receive from the Buyer additional cash payments for Commercial Aircraft
actually delivered by Boeing and Airbus in calendar years 2003, 2004, 2005 and
2006 in excess of the Threshold Level set forth below in Section 2.8(b).
Should the Greenslet Report cease publishing its Airline Monitor Report, the
parties will use their best efforts to mutually agree on another third party
reporting service to verify deliveries made by Boeing and Airbus each year. If
the parties cannot agree, the Buyer and the Parent will have the joint right
to seek verification directly from Boeing and Airbus of their deliveries of
Commercial Aircraft for the prior year.



(b) For purposes of this Section 2.8, the Threshold Level for each calendar
year is set forth in the chart below:



    

Calendar Year

(c) To the extent that the aggregate number of Commercial Aircraft actually
delivered by Boeing and Airbus in each calendar year as reported in the
Greenslet Report during the four year Earn-Out period exceeds the Threshold
Level for such calendar year, the Buyer shall pay $400,000 to the Parent for
each Commercial Aircraft actually delivered by Boeing and Airbus in such
calendar year in excess of the Threshold Level for such calendar year;
_provided, however_ , in respect of each calendar year the Buyer shall only be
obligated to pay a maximum amount of $12,500,000 regardless of the number of
Commercial Aircraft actually delivered in any calendar year or during the four
year Earn-Out period; _provided, further, however_ , that all or a portion of
any amount to be paid by the Buyer to the Parent pursuant to the terms of
this Section 2.8(c) shall be deposited in escrow if required pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event the number of Commercial Aircraft
delivered in any calendar 

 

24 ##### Table of Contents

  

 year included in the Earn-Out period exceeds the Threshold Level such excess
number may not be carried over or back to any calendar year included in the
Earn-Out period in which the applicable Threshold Level is not met. Any Earn-
Out payment required to be made by the Buyer to the Parent shall be made by
wire transfer to an account designated by the Parent within ten business days
after publication of the first Greenslet Report containing actual deliveries
of Boeing and Airbus Commercial Aircraft for the prior calendar year except to
the extent all or a portion of such Earn-Out payment is deposited in escrow as
required pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. For avoidance
of doubt, a hypothetical calculation of the Earn-Out is set forth on Schedule
2.8 together with a copy of the Greenslet Report (Table 3) published for
January/February 2002.



(d) If Boeing or Airbus acquire, merge or combine with any other producer of
Commercial Aircraft, the total amount of Commercial Aircraft that shall be
calculated as having been delivered by Boeing and Airbus for purposes of this
Section 2.8 shall not include the make/model numbers of Commercial Aircraft of
any producer of Commercial Aircraft acquired, merged or combined with Boeing
or Airbus following the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of Boeing and Airbus may acquire production facilities or transfer
production to production facilities owned by Boeing or Airbus, as the case may
be, to manufacture Boeing or Airbus Commercial Aircraft, and any Commercial
Aircraft manufactured at such facilities will count for purposes of this
Section 2.8.



SECTION 2.9 _Allocation of Consideration._



(a) Within the 160 day period following the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver
to the Parent a draft Schedule 2.9 (the "Draft Schedule 2.9") for the Parents
review and approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Draft
Schedule 2.9 shall allocate the Consideration among the Fastener Business
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Allocation"). Within the 10 day period following
receipt of the Draft Schedule 2.9, the Parent shall notify the Buyer in
writing of its approval or of any objections that it may have. If the Parent
approves the Draft Schedule 2.9, such schedule shall become the final Schedule
2.9 (the "Final Allocation"). If the Parent objects to the Draft Schedule
2.9, the Buyer and the Parent shall use their good faith efforts to resolve
the matter within the 10 day period following receipt by the Buyer of the
Parents objection to the Draft Schedule 2.9. If the Buyer and the Parent are
unable to resolve the matter within such period each party shall use their own
allocation and there shall be no Final Allocation.



(b) If the parties agree on a Final Allocation: (i) the Buyer and the Parent
shall each report the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and any
related agreements for all Tax purposes consistent with the Final Allocation;
(ii) the Buyer and the Parent shall (A) file Form 8594 in accordance with the
requirements (including permitted extensions) of Section 1060 of the Code (or
state or local Tax law, as the case may be), (B) be bound by the Final
Allocation for purposes of determining Taxes, (C) prepare and file, and cause
its affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
the Final Allocation, and (D) take no position, and cause its affiliates to
take no position, inconsistent with the Final Allocation on any applicable Tax
Return, in 

 

25 ##### Table of Contents

  

 any audit or proceeding before any Taxing Authority, or in any report made
for Tax purposes, except as required by a final determination or resolution of
any dispute with any taxing authority concerning the Final Allocation; and
(iii) in the event the Final Allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority,
the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto of (x) the assertion of a dispute and (y) the resolution of
such dispute.



SECTION 2.10 _Treatment of Accounts Receivable At the Closing_. At least
five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall deliver to the
Buyer Schedule 2.10 which shall set forth for each receivable of the Fastener
Business as of the close of business on the immediately preceding Friday, the
name of the payor, the date the receivable was booked by the Fastener
Business, the original amount of the receivable, the date the receivable was
or is due and the amount of the receivable on such Friday. Schedule 2.10 shall
also indicate each receivable which, as of such Friday, is more than ninety
days past due and the obligor of which is subject to bankruptcy or similar
insolvency proceedings (the "Overdue Closing Receivables"). The Buyer shall
have the option to require that at the Closing the Sellers retain and not
transfer to the Buyer any or all of the Overdue Closing Receivables, and the
Buyer shall reduce the amount of the Consideration payable to the Sellers
pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i) by the aggregate amount of the Overdue Closing
Receivables that the Sellers retain. The Buyer shall notify the Sellers in
writing at least two business days prior to the Closing Date which Overdue
Closing Receivables on Schedule 2.10 the Sellers shall retain (the "Buyer
Closing Receivables Notice"). After the Closing, the Buyer will provide
reasonable access to all documentation and personnel necessary for the Parent
to pursue collection of the Overdue Closing Receivables retained by the
Sellers. The Parent will have the right to make copies of any documentation
necessary for such collection at the Parents expense. If the customer pays
the Buyer in respect of an Overdue Closing Receivable retained by the Sellers,
the Buyer shall promptly remit such payment to the Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the Parent for
such purpose.

its commercially reasonable efforts to collect the accounts receivable
outstanding as of the Closing Date, which shall represent all the account

Sheet (the "Receivables"). Upon the earlier of the completion of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet by the Buyer or ninety days following the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall have the right to transfer and assign any or all of the
uncollected portion of any Receivable which is at least ninety days past due
as of such date to the Parent by delivering an executed assignment agreement

each such Receivable being so assigned (the "Assigned Receivable") and
certifies that no portion of the Receivables being transferred and assigned
to the Parent has been collected by the Buyer or its Affiliates and that the
Buyer and its Affiliates have otherwise complied with this Section 5.20 (the
"Receivables Certificate"). Within five business days after receipt of

Receivables that remain uncollected as of such date. To the extent that the
aggregate amount of the Assigned Receivables transferred and assigned to the
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.20 is less than $3,832,000, the Buyer shall
promptly remit to the Parent the difference between the aggregate amount of
the Assigned Receivables transferred to the Parent and $3,832,000 by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the
Parent for such purpose. If the customer pays the Buyer in respect of an
Assigned Receivable, the Buyer shall promptly remit such payment to the Parent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated
by the Parent for such purpose. The Buyer hereby agrees that it shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action or omit to take
any action that would (i) waive the Parents right to collect, release or
otherwise forgive any Assigned Receivables or (ii) result in any legal
restrictions on the Parents ability to pursue and collect any Assigned
Receivables. The Buyer hereby acknowledges that the Parent shall have the
exclusive right to pursue and collect any Assigned Receivables. Subject to
Section 5.3, the Buyer will provide access to all documentation and personnel
necessary for the Parent to pursue collection of the Assigned Receivables. The
Parent will have the right to make copies of any documentation necessary for
such collection.

responsible for, pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Buyer, all of the Parents obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the Parents obligations under Articles VI,
VIII and XI). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.21
shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Parent from taking any action
that, after receiving and considering the advice of its outside legal counsel,
is required in order for the Board to properly exercise its fiduciary
responsibilities to the stockholders of the Parent under applicable Law.

deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the year in which the Effective

and the Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer against, any and
all Damages with respect to, any Parent Pension Plan and any benefits under
such plan to which any Transferred Employee or any former employee of the
Fastener Business is currently entitled or may become entitled after the
Effective Time. The Buyer shall provide such information as the Sellers or
their designee may reasonably request, from time to time, in connection with
the administration of the Parent Pension Plans.



(c) (i) The Sellers shall retain and be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations, and the Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer

to make available an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000 for payments to a
group of Fastener Business Employees identified on Schedule 6.2(c)(ii) (the

into good faith discussions regarding the allocation of the Payment Pool
among the individuals identified on Schedule 6.2(c)(ii); _provided, however_ ,

to such employee under his contract with the Fastener Business, the Parent
shall pay such difference to the Fastener Business Employee in accordance with
the terms of such persons contract, and the Buyer shall have no obligation
with respect to any such change of control, stay pay and other retention

Transferred Employee is terminated by the Buyer prior to the sixth month
anniversary of the Closing Date, (a) the Sellers shall remain fully liable for
payment of the full amount of such employees severance payments under his
employment agreement and (b) the Buyer shall not rehire such terminated
Transferred Employee as an employee or a consultant for a two year period
following such employees date of termination.

any Transferred Employee under any Plan of the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates and each Individual Agreement to which the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates are a party in the nature of interim benefits to
motivate the Fastener Business Employees to become Transferred
Employees, including any payments made pursuant to a retention contract or
other retention bonus arrangement but the Seller may use the Payment Pool to
satisfy its obligations to pay such benefits due to the Transferred Employees.



(e) The Sellers shall be fully responsible for any benefits in the nature of
severance pay due to any Fastener Business Employee under any Plan or
Individual Agreement who does not accept an offer of employment described in
Section 6.1(a) hereof. The severance benefits provided by the Buyer to any
Transferred Employee who is based in the United States (each, a "Transferred
U.S. Employee") whose employment with the Buyer is involuntarily terminated
(other than for cause) by the Buyer or a Buyer subsidiary within twelve months
following the Effective Time shall not be less favorable than the severance
benefits set forth on Schedule 6.2(e) (which are the benefits that a Fastener
Business Employee would have been entitled to had his or her employment been
terminated by the Sellers or any subsidiaries of the Sellers (as the case may
be) immediately prior to the Effective Time).



(f) To the extent that any obligations might arise under WARN, 29 U.S.C.
Section 2101 _et seq._ , or under any similar provision of any Law
(hereinafter referred to collectively as "WARN Obligations") as a consequence
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers shall be
responsible for any WARN Obligations arising as a result of any employment
losses occurring prior to the Effective Time, and the Buyer shall be
responsible for any WARN Obligations arising as a result of any employment
losses occurring on or after the Effective Time. At the Closing Date, the
Sellers will deliver to the Buyer a list reflecting the number of Fastener
Business Employees who suffered an employment loss during the ninety day
period prior to the Closing.



(g) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Transferred Employee shall not be
eligible to make contributions (or have contributions made on his behalf) to
the Sellers defined contribution plans (the "Parent DC Plans"), other than
contributions payable for periods prior to the Closing Date which have not
been remitted as of the Closing Date. The Sellers shall cause each Transferred
Employee to be fully vested in such Transferred Employees account balance in
the Parent DC Plan in which such Transferred Employee participates as of the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall establish or designate one or more defined
contribution plans in which Transferred U.S. Employees shall be eligible to
participate as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (the "Buyer DC
Plans"). Each Transferred Employee shall be permitted to receive a
distribution of such Transferred Employees full account balance from the
Parent DC Plans or have such distribution "rolled over" in cash to an eligible
retirement plan (including the Buyer DC Plan), as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date.



(h) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Transferred U.S. Employee shall
cease to accrue additional benefits under Sellers defined benefit pension
plans listed on Schedule 6.2(h) (the "Parent DB Plans"). Each Transferred U.S.

62 ##### Table of Contents

  

permitted to receive a distribution of such Transferred U.S. Employees
accrued benefit, actuarially adjusted for commencement before normal
retirement age, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Plan from the
Parent DB Plan in which such Transferred U.S. Employee participates as of the
Closing Date, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable (but not later than six months) after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall establish or designate one or more defined benefit pension plans to
cover those Transferred U.S. Employees who, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, participated in any Parent DB Plan, effective as of the Closing Date
(the "Buyer DB Plans").



(i) The Sellers shall be responsible for and pay any and all workers
compensation and other similar statutory claims asserted by or with respect to
any Transferred Employees in respect of any injury or other compensable event
or occupational illness or disease which occurred or is attributable to any
event, state of facts or condition which existed or occurred in whole on or
before the Closing Date. The Buyer shall be responsible for and pay any and
all workers compensation and other similar statutory claims asserted by or
with respect to any Transferred Employees hired by the Buyer in respect of any
injury or other compensable event or occupational illness or disease which
occurred or is attributable to any event, state of facts or condition which
existed or occurred in whole after the Closing Date. If any such injury or
other compensable event or occupational illness or disease of a Transferred
Employee who is employed by the Sellers before the Closing Date and by the
Buyer after the Closing Date is attributable in part to causes occurring
before the Closing Date and in part to causes after the Closing Date and is
the basis of a workers compensation or other similar statutory claim, the
liability for any such claims shall be shared by the Sellers and the Buyer in
the proportion of the periods of exposure in respect of the occupational
illness or disease of such Transferred Employee which occurred before the
Closing Date and that which occurred after the Closing Date except for
California employees. For Transferred Employees working in California, if any
such injury or other comparable event or occupational illness or disease of a
Transferred Employee who is employed by the Sellers before the Closing Date
and by the Buyer after the Closing Date is attributable in part to causes
occurring before the Closing Date and in part to causes occurring after the
Closing Date and is the basis of a workers compensation or other similar
statutory claim, the liability for any such claims shall be shared by the
Sellers and the Buyer in the proportion of the periods of exposure as would be
taken into account under the applicable provisions of the California Labor
Code in respect of the occupational illness or disease of such Transferred
Employee which occurred before the Closing Date and that which occurred after
the Closing Date. If the Buyer pays or is otherwise held responsible for the
Sellers allocated portion of any workers compensation or other similar
statutory claim, the Sellers will reimburse the Buyer for such portion paid by
the Buyer. The Buyers obligations under this Section 6.2(i) shall not
preclude the Buyers right to indemnification under Article XI for any breach
of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers in this Agreement.



(j) _Treatment of Foreign Plans and Employees_. Effective as of the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall assume Sellers liabilities and obligations, and shall
receive

all administrative services at the Buyers expense with respect to the
Buyers provision of health, dental and disability benefits to the Transferred
U.S. Employees through December 31, 2003. With respect to the Sellers
provision of administrative services pursuant to this Section 6.2(k), the

the costs actually incurred by the Sellers with respect to their provision of
such services. The Buyer shall pay the Sellers the amount indicated in such

_CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_



 

SECTION 8.1 _Tax Returns_.



(a) The Sellers shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be filed) when due
(taking into account extensions) (i) all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed on or before the Closing Date by or with respect to the Fastener
Business Assets and each of the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries for taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (ii) all
consolidated, combined, unitary and similar Tax Returns that include one or
more of the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries as members of the "affiliated
group" (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code or similar provision
of state, local or non-U.S. law) of which the Parent (or any predecessor or
successor) is the common parent. The Sellers shall timely prepare, or cause
to be timely prepared, any such Tax Returns due after the Closing Date (taking
into account extensions) for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and deliver such Tax Returns to the Buyer for filing.



(b) The Buyer shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be filed) when
due (taking into account extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be

of the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries as members of the "affiliated group"
(within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code or similar provision of
state, local or non-U.S. law) of which the Parent (or any predecessor or
successor) is the common parent) for taxable years or periods beginning after
the Closing Date and any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period").



(c) The Buyer shall make available to the Sellers for review and approval any
Tax Returns required to be prepared by the Buyer for any taxable year or
period that includes a Straddle Period. The Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make such

 

66 ##### Table of Contents

  

Tax Returns available for review and approval as required under this paragraph
sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such Tax Returns (but in
no event less than 30 days prior to their due dates) to provide the Sellers
with a meaningful opportunity to review and approve such Tax Returns and have
such Tax Returns modified before filing, provided that such approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyer and the Sellers shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any issues arising out of the review of such Tax Returns. If
a Tax Return is due before the date a disputed item is resolved hereunder, it
shall be filed as prepared and resolved items shall be reflected on an
amended Tax Return or other applicable Tax adjustment request.



SECTION 8.2 _Payment of Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and except to the extent any such Taxes are taken into account in
preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Sellers shall pay or cause to
be paid, on a timely basis, all Taxes due with respect to the Tax liability of
the Fastener Business Assets and the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries for
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of any

thereof is due, the portion of such Taxes for that portion of any
Straddle Period which ends on the Closing Date (calculated pursuant to
Section 8.3). The Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, on a timely basis, all
Taxes due with respect to the Tax liability of the Fastener Business Assets
and the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries for taxable periods beginning after

after the Closing Date.

and the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries that are not based on income or
receipts ( _e.g._ , property Taxes) for the portion of any Straddle Period
which ends on the Closing Date shall be computed based on the ratio of the
number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period and the number of days
in the entire taxable period, and (ii) the periodic Taxes of the Fastener
Business Assets and the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries that are not based
on income or receipts for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on the
day after the Closing Date shall be computed based on the ratio of the number
of days in such portion of the Straddle Period and the number of days in the
entire taxable period.



(b) _Non-Periodic Taxes_. (i) The Taxes of the Fastener Business Assets and
the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries for that portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (other than Taxes described in Section 8.3(a)
above), shall be computed on a "closing-of-the-books" basis as if such taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) the
Taxes of the Fastener Business Assets and the Transferred Fastener
Subsidiaries for that portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date (other than Taxes described in Section 8.3(a) above), shall be
computed on a "closing-of-the-books" basis as if such taxable period began on
the day after the Closing Date.

relate to any taxable period, or portion thereof, for which the Sellers are
liable pursuant to Section 8.2, except to the extent that such refund or
credit against Tax relates to Taxes for which the liability is assumed by the
Buyer, shall be for the account of the Sellers, and the Buyer shall pay over
to the Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within ten
days after receipt of such credit or entitlement thereto. The Buyer shall pay
the Sellers interest at the rate prescribed under Section 6621(a)(1) of the
Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid when due under this Section

predecessor or successor to any of the foregoing) from and against any and
all Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of (i)

thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) Taxes imposed on or payable
by the Sellers, any Seller Affiliate or the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries
with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date, (iii) Taxes of the Sellers or its Transferred Fastener

68 ##### Table of Contents

  

parent that arises under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or comparable
provisions of foreign, state or local law, and (iv) Taxes for which Sellers
are responsible for in Section 5.9, in each case except to the extent any such
Taxes are taken into account in preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet.



(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, the Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless the Parent and its
subsidiaries other than the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(including, without limitation, any predecessor or successor to any of the
foregoing) from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses relating to,
resulting from or arising out of (i) Taxes described in Section 8.5(a)(i) and

the Sellers to perform any of the agreements it is required to perform under
this Article VIII, and the Buyer agrees to indemnify the Sellers and hold
them harmless from all Taxes, expenses or other losses arising out of the
failure by the Buyer to perform any of the agreements it is required to
perform under this Article VIII.



(d) Any indemnification obligation of the Buyer or the Sellers pursuant to
this Section 8.5 shall be net of any Tax Benefit realized by the indemnified
party or its Affiliates and increased by the relevant After Tax Amount. For
purposes of this Agreement, "After Tax Amount" means any additional amount
necessary to reflect the Tax consequences of the receipt or accrual of such
reimbursement payment (including the payment of an additional amount or
amounts hereunder) determined by using the actual marginal federal, state,
foreign or local rates for the relevant taxable period.



(e) The Buyer and the Sellers agree to treat any payment under this Section
8.5 as an adjustment to the Consideration.

 



SECTION 8.6 _Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments_.



(a) If the examination of any federal, state, local or other Tax Return of the
Buyer under Section 8.1(b) shall result (by settlement or otherwise) in any
adjustment which permits the Sellers or its Affiliates to increase deductions,
losses or Tax credits or decrease the income, gains or recapture of Tax
credits which would otherwise (but for such adjustments) have been reported
or taken into account (including by way of any increase in basis) by the
Sellers or its Affiliates for one or more periods for which it is required to
file a Tax Return, the Buyer shall notify the Sellers and provide it with
adequate information so that the Sellers can reflect on its or the
appropriate Affiliates Tax Returns such increases in deductions, losses or
Tax credits or decreases in income, gains or recapture of Tax credits. The
Sellers shall pay to the Buyer, within 30 days of the receipt of such
information, the amount of any resulting Tax Benefits.

 

69 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) If the examination of any federal, state, local or other Tax Return of the
Sellers under Section 8.1(a) shall result (by settlement or otherwise) in any
adjustment which permits the Buyer or its Affiliates to increase deductions,
losses or Tax credits or decrease the income, gains or recapture of Tax
credits which would otherwise (but for such adjustments) have been reported
or taken into account (including by way of any increase in basis) by the Buyer
or its Affiliates for one or more periods for which it is required to file a

any resulting Tax Benefits.



SECTION 8.7 _Cooperation._ After the Closing Date, each of the Sellers

assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 8.1(a), (ii)
cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax authority
regarding, any Tax Returns of any of the Fastener Business Assets and

Sellers reasonable written notice, and the opportunity to make copies of any
such items, before disposing of such items.



SECTION 8.8 _Contests_.

notify the other party in writing within 10 days of the commencement of any
Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding affecting the Taxes of any
of the Fastener Business Assets or Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries, which,
if determined adversely to the Taxpayer ("Tax Indemnitee") or after the lapse
of time would be grounds for indemnification under Section 8.5 of this
Agreement by the other party ("Tax Indemnitor"). Such notice shall contain
factual information describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail
and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax
authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If either the Buyer
or the Sellers fails to give the other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax
liability as required under this Agreement, then (i) if the Tax Indemnitor is
precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from contesting the asserted
Tax liability in any administrative or judicial forums, then such party shall
not have any obligation to indemnify the other party for any losses arising
out of such asserted Tax liability, and (ii) if the Tax Indemnitor is not so
precluded from contesting, if such failure to give prompt notice results in a
detriment to the Tax Indemnitor, then any amount which the Tax Indemnitor is
otherwise required to pay pursuant to Section 8.5 of this Agreement with
respect to such liability shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

liability for (A) Taxes of the Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the
Fastener Business Assets or (B) the U.S. federal, state or local Tax liability
of or with respect to the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries relating to any
taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall have the right, at their expense, to control the conduct of such audit
or proceeding; _provided, however_ , that if such audit or proceeding would
be reasonably expected to result in a material increase in Tax liability of or
with respect to the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries for taxable periods
ending after the Closing Date or with respect to the Fastener Business
Assets for which the Buyer (or its Affiliates) would be liable, the Sellers
shall not settle any such audit or proceeding without the consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and (ii) in the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted liability for Taxes addressed in Section 5.9
or with respect to the foreign Tax liability of the Transferred Fastener
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable years or periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or any Straddle Period, the Buyer and the Parent shall have joint
control of and shall cooperate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding;
such joint control shall include strategic decision-making regarding
audits, selection of an appropriate spokesperson to interface with the
applicable Tax authority, and selection of advisors with respect to such
periods. If the Buyer and the Parent cannot agree with respect to any matter
relating to the conduct of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
described in Section 8.8(b)(ii), they shall jointly appoint an impartial
nationally recognized Tax lawyer (the "Advisor") mutually acceptable to the
Parent and the Buyer (or, if they cannot agree on a mutually acceptable Tax
lawyer, they shall cause their respective law firms to select such lawyer).
The Buyer and the Parent shall provide to the Advisor full cooperation. The
Advisor shall be instructed to reach its conclusion regarding the dispute
within 15 business days. The conclusion reached by the Advisor shall be
conclusive and binding on the Parent and the Buyer. All fees payable to the
Advisor in connection with the resolution of such disagreements shall be
divided equally between the Parent and the Buyer.



(c) _Control of Contests Involving Post-Closing Periods or Straddle Periods_.

asserted liability for Taxes (A) of the Buyer or its Affiliates with respect
to the Fastener Business Assets, (B) of the Transferred Fastener
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable years or periods beginning after the
Closing Date or (C) for any Straddle Period (other than a foreign Tax Straddle
Period which is governed by Section 8.8(b)(ii)), the Buyer shall have the
right to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding; _provided,
however,_ that if such audit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to
result in a material increase in Tax liability of any Fastener Business Assets
or Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries for which the Sellers would be liable,
in the case of any Straddle Period (other than a foreign Tax Straddle Period,
which is governed by Section 8.8(b)(ii)) the Sellers may participate in the
conduct of such audit or proceeding at their own expense and in each case the
Buyer shall not settle any such audit or proceeding without the consent of the
Parent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

applicable Law, no Indemnitee will be entitled to make a claim against an
Indemnifying Party under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(c)(i), as applicable,
unless (x) such claim is made within the applicable survival period set forth
in Section 11.1(a) and (y) until the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses
incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to an event or occurrence and all
other events or occurrences caused by the same circumstances exceeds $50,000

hereunder to the full extent of its Indemnifiable Losses in respect thereof. 



(b) No Indemnitee will be entitled to make a claim against an Indemnifying
Party under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(c)(i), as applicable, unless (x) such
claim is made within the applicable survival period set forth in Section
11.1(a) and (y) until the aggregate amount of all of its Base Claims which may
be asserted for Indemnifiable Losses under Sections 11.2(a)(i) or 11.2(c)(i),
as applicable, exceeds $5,000,000, in which event (subject to the following
provisions of Section 11.3), such Indemnitee may assert its right to
indemnification hereunder to the full extent of all such Indemnifiable
Losses. 

 

79 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the indemnification
obligations of the Sellers, under Section 11.2(a)(i), on the one hand, and of
the Buyer, under Section 11.2(b)(i), on the other hand, will not exceed
$250,000,000.



(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of any applicable
Law, the Buyer will be entitled to make a claim against any of the Sellers
under Section 11.2(a)(ii), (iii) or (iv) until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date.



(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of any
Indemnifiable Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article
XI shall be net of (i) any amount actually received by the Indemnitee or paid
to Third Parties on behalf of the Indemnitee under insurance policies of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss (and the
Indemnitee shall be required to submit a claim under such insurance policies
with respect to such Indemnifiable Loss) and (ii) any Tax Benefit actually
realized as a result of such Indemnifiable Loss.

 



(f) The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Indemnified Party in respect of any insurance relating to the Indemnifiable
Losses to the extent of any indemnification payments made hereunder.



SECTION 11.4 _Defense of Claims_.



(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 calendar days
after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. Such notice by the
Indemnitee will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, will
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and will indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will
have the right to participate in, or, by giving written notice to the
Indemnitee, to assume, the defense of any Third Party Claim (other than
Product Claims which only the Sellers shall have the right to participate in)
at such Indemnifying Party s own expense and by such Indemnifying
Partys own counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), and the
Indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense.



(b) If, within ten calendar days after giving notice of a Third Party Claim to
an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 11.4(a), an Indemnitee receives
written notice from the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnifying Party
has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (other than
Product Claims) as provided in the last sentence of Section 11.4(a), the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; _provided,
however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten calendar days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnitee that the Indemnitee
believes the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the Indemnitee
may assume its own defense, and the

 

80 ##### Table of Contents

  

Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or
incurred in connection therewith. Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any
Third Party Claim. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim
without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Indemnifying Party desires to
accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party will give written
notice to the Indemnitee to that effect. If the Indemnitee fails to consent
to such firm offer within ten calendar days after its receipt of such notice,
the Indemnitee may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and,
in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third Party Claim will not exceed the amount of such settlement offer.



(c) Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss which does
not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by
giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than 30 calendar days after the Indemnitee becomes aware
of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnitee will describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by
the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of 30 calendar days
within which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such 30 calendar day period, the Indemnifying
Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the
Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnitee on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.



(d) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information
in any notice as provided in Sections 11.4(a), 11.4(b) or 11.4(c) will not
affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except and only to the
extent that, as a result of such failure, any party which was entitled
to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment under
its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise prejudiced as a result of
such failure.



SECTION 11.5 _Exclusive Remedies_. If the Closing occurs, then the
remedies provided in this Article XI shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedies with respect to all Indemnifiable Losses contemplated by Section 11.2
and all claims for breach of any representation or warranty or covenant or
agreement to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date contained in
this Agreement, except for fraud or other willful dishonesty. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any matter, liability or obligation as to which
the Buyer has neither expressly assumed liability pursuant to this Agreement
nor has agreed to provide indemnification to the Sellers (or, where the Buyer
has assumed liability or agreed to provide indemnification, any matters,
liabilities or obligations that fall outside of the scope of such assumed or
indemnified liabilities), the Buyer expressly retains all rights it may
possess under any applicable Law. Furthermore, the provisions of this Article
XI shall not affect the rights of any party hereto against any third party
(including a third party whose claim against a party hereto is the basis of a
claim for indemnification hereunder) and shall not inure to the benefit of any
third party.

 

81 ##### Table of Contents

  

Notwithstanding anything in Article XI, Article VIII will be the exclusive
agreement among the parties with respect to indemnification, procedures and
remedies with respect to Tax matters.



SECTION 11.6 _Seller Environmental Indemnity_.



(a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 11.5 and 11.6, from and after the
Closing Date, each of the Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Buyer, the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries, the
Buyers other subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any
predecessor or successor to any of the foregoing) (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Fastener Environmental
Liabilities in excess of the amount of the reserve for environmental, health,
safety and litigation on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, _provided,_ that any
claims for indemnification related to Discontinued Operations or Pre-Closing
Off-Site Disposal Locations shall not be subject to any deductible for the
amounts in the reserve for environmental, health, safety and litigation.



(b) The indemnification obligations of the Sellers under this Section 11.6
shall terminate on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, except with
respect to (i) any Fastener Environmental Liability for which the Buyer has
provided written notice to any of the Sellers prior to the fifth anniversary
of the Closing Date of the facts underlying such Fastener Environmental
Liability with reasonable specificity, (ii) any claim related to a Pre-Closing
Off-Site Disposal Location and (iii) any claim related to Discontinued
Operations.



(c) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Buyer will each designate
a representative (each, a "Representative") to receive information and
consult with the other with respect to Fastener Environmental Liabilities (in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.3). From and after the Closing, the
Buyer will conduct and control all Remedial Action and negotiations with any
Government entity in respect of all Fastener Environmental Conditions that are
subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.6. Such Remedial Actions
shall be performed in a commercially reasonable manner consistent with the
use of the Fastener Business Assets as of the Closing Date, including, to the
extent allowed or authorized by applicable Environmental Law or the Government
agency with jurisdiction over a Remedial Action, the use of Remediation
Standards that are applicable to such properties based on the use and location
of such properties as of the Closing Date. The Buyer will make its
environmental personnel and consultants reasonably available to the Sellers
and the Sellers Representative to discuss Fastener Environmental Conditions.
The Buyer will provide the Sellers Representative and the Sellers
environmental consultants with reasonable access to the properties of
the Fastener Business and copies of all nonprivileged information with
respect to the Remedial Actions to be taken in respect of such Environmental
Actions. The Buyer will select consultants and contractors to implement such
Remedial Actions (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent) and will also
provide the Sellers Representative and its environmental consultants with
copies of all reports, analytical data, correspondence, directives, orders and
documents submitted to or received by the Buyer from any

 

82 ##### Table of Contents

  

Government entity in connection with the Remedial Action and other non-
privileged documents created or received by or on behalf of the Buyer
in connection with the Remedial Action. The Buyer shall afford the Sellers a
reasonable opportunity to comment on the Buyers proposed response to a
Fastener Environmental Condition, and the Buyer shall not unreasonably refuse
to incorporate the Sellers comments.



(d) The Buyer shall inform any of the Sellers promptly in writing of any
Fastener Environmental Condition or Environmental Action in respect of which
the Sellers may have an indemnification obligation under this Section 11.6,
provided, that the failure of the Buyer to so promptly inform any of the
Sellers shall not affect the rights of the Buyer except to the extent that
such failure to give prompt notice adversely affects the rights and
obligations of any of the Sellers under this Section 11.6.



(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms will have the
following meanings:



(i) "Environmental Action" means any notice of any violation of any
Environmental Law or any claim, citation, summons or any investigation,
action, lawsuit or proceeding by any Person which seeks to impose liability
(including, without limitation, liability for investigatory costs, cleanup
costs, governmental response costs, natural resources damages, property
damages, personal injuries or penalties) pursuant to any Environmental Law.



(ii) "Environmental Contamination" means the presence, whether known or
unknown, of any Hazardous Materials in soils, surface water, groundwater,
sediments or other environmental media, including the movement or migration

leased locations that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time
including, without limitation, at Pre-Closing Off-Site Disposal Locations;
(B) Environmental Contamination at or migrating from the Fastener Business
Assets prior to the Closing Date, whether or not such Environmental
Contamination came into existence as a result of the Fastener Business or any

Business Assets); (C) any violation or alleged violation of, or noncompliance
or alleged noncompliance with, applicable Environmental Law with respect to
the Fastener Business that commenced prior to the Effective Time; or (D) any
other circumstance or condition that occurred on or prior to the Effective

(iv) "Fastener Environmental Liability" means all losses, damages, charges,

based on any applicable Environmental Laws existing on the Closing Date in
respect of any Fastener Environmental Condition; _provided_ that with respect
to Environmental Contamination at a Fastener Business Asset, applicable
Environmental Law shall include the Remediation Standards in each relevant
jurisdiction that would be applicable or acceptable to properties such as the
Fastener Business Real Properties or the properties leased pursuant to the
Fastener Business Leases, based on the use and location of such properties as
of the Closing Date, such that the performance of Remedial Action on such
properties if Environmental Contamination is discovered above such standards
shall be subject to indemnification under this Section 11.6 (subject to any
other limitations in this Agreement). Fastener Environmental Liability shall
not include (i) any consequential, special or punitive damages, except in the
case of fraud or to the extent actually awarded to a third party by a court
in connection with a Third Party Claim, or (ii) any internal fees and expenses
(including, without limitation, in-house counsels fees and expenses). In
addition, to the extent that the Buyer contributes to or exacerbates a
Fastener Environmental Condition as a result of its actions or omissions,
including, without limitation, its unreasonable failure to mitigate any
violation or noncompliance with applicable Environmental Law, any material
increase in losses, damages, charges, liabilities, costs or expenses
resulting from said exacerbation or failure to mitigate shall not be a
Fastener Environmental Liability. For purposes of this Agreement, Third Party
Claims to the extent arising from or related to activities of the Fastener
Business prior to the Closing Date for asbestos-related illnesses, injuries or
other harm or personal injury or property damage arising from exposure to
Hazardous Materials, are not deemed to be within the scope of the term

further Release of any Hazardous Materials so that it does not migrate or

and (iii) to perform studies and investigations in connection with, or as a
precondition to, clause (i) or (ii) above.

resulting from an enacted statute, promulgated rule or regulation issued by a
Government regulatory agency, in each case existing on the Closing Date, or
(B) developed on a case-by-case basis through a risk assessment or other
methodology (and taking into account any relevant guidance issued by a
Government regulatory agency), which are commercially reasonable for
companies in the fastener industry and which are commercially reasonable for
the use and given the location of the properties as of the Closing Date) that

on the use and location of a particular property.

Section 1.10(b), the Buyer expressly retains all rights it may possess under
any applicable Law with respect to Fastener Environmental Liabilities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 11.6 shall not
affect the rights of any party hereto against any third party (including a
third party whose claim against a party hereto is the basis
for indemnification hereunder) and shall not inure to the benefit of any
third party.



SECTION 11.7 _Resolution of Indemnification Disputes_. If a dispute
arises in connection with determining the validity or amount of a claim for
indemnification for an Indemnifiable Loss under this Agreement ("Dispute"),
and if the Dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions between
representatives of the Parent and representatives of the Buyer within thirty
days following receipt of notice of a Dispute, the parties agree first
to endeavor to settle the dispute in an amicable manner by mediation
administered under the CPR Mediation Procedure established by the CPR
Institute for Dispute Resolution ("CPR") before resorting to arbitration. If a
Dispute cannot be resolved through such mediation process within thirty days
following the appointment of the mediator, the Dispute will be settled finally
by arbitration under the CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration (the
"Rules"), then in effect, by a sole arbitrator, chosen by agreement of the
parties within twenty days of the receipt by the respondent of a copy of the
Notice of arbitration. Any arbitrator appointed by CPR shall be a retired
judge or a practicing attorney with no less than fifteen years of experience
with large commercial cases and an experienced arbitrator. The arbitration
will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. The
hearing on the merits shall be held no later than six months after the
appointment of the arbitrator unless the parties otherwise agree or the
arbitrator extends such time period for good cause shown.

 

85 ##### Table of Contents

  

The award shall be in writing and shall state the findings of fact and
conclusions of law on which it is based. The award of the arbitrator shall be
final and binding on the parties and judgment upon the award may be entered
and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Unless the parties otherwise
agree in writing, the mediation and arbitration will be held in New York, New
York. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) and the Buyer and the Parent shall each bear one-
half of the costs and expenses payable to the mediator and arbitrator.



SECTION 11.8 _Indemnity Tax Credit Amount_. The Sellers indemnification
obligations under Section 8.5 and this Article XI shall be credited by the
net cumulative amount of (i) any Tax Benefits recognized by the Buyer (or its
Affiliates) resulting from the actual utilization in any Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date by the Buyer (or its Affiliates) of any French or
German net operating loss of a Transferred Fastener Subsidiary organized in
France or Germany (as the case may be) that the Buyer or its Affiliates carry
forward from a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date and that may
no longer be subject to possible disallowance by any French or German Taxing
authority minus (ii) any such Tax Benefit amounts that have previously been
used to reduce any of the Sellers indemnification obligations.

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2002 (the

the Transferred Fastener Subsidiaries;



WHEREAS, Section 2.4 of the Acquisition Agreement provides for the Buyer to

terms hereof;



 

WHEREAS, Articles VI, VIII and Article XI of the Acquisition Agreement provide

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of the
respective covenants and agreements of the parties herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:



   

1. __

 |



 |

 _Appointment of Escrow Agent_ 

---|---|--- 



The Buyer and the Parent hereby appoint the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent
hereby accepts its appointment as escrow agent, to hold, invest, reinvest and
disburse the Escrow Funds (as defined below) in accordance with the terms
hereof. ##### Table of Contents

  



   

2. __

 |



 |

 _Delivery of Funds_ 

---|---|--- 



Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement, the
Buyer is delivering to the Escrow Agent the Initial Escrow Amount, to be held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt of the Initial Escrow Amount.



   

3. __

 |



 |

 _Investment of Funds_ 

---|---|--- 



(a) During the term of this Escrow Agreement, all funds held by the Escrow
Agent under this Escrow Agreement along with any interest or income earned
thereon (collectively, the "Escrow Funds") shall be continuously invested and
reinvested by the Escrow Agent in Permitted Investments (as defined below) as
the Parent shall from time to time direct in writing, in the sole discretion
of the Parent. All investment instructions hereunder shall be provided to
the Escrow Agent no later than one business day prior to the date on which
the investments directed therein are to be made. During the term of this
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Funds shall be continuously invested and
reinvested by the Escrow Agent in any of the following qualified investments
(each a "Permitted Investment"): (i) any bonds or obligations which as to
principal and interest constitute direct obligations of or are guaranteed by
the United States of America; (ii) certificates of deposit of banks or trust
companies, including the Escrow Agent, organized under the laws of the United
States of America or any state thereof, with capital and surplus of at least
$100,000,000; (iii) commercial paper or finance company paper, including that
of any affiliate of the Escrow Agent, which is rated not less than prime-one
or A-1 or their equivalents by Moodys Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation or their respective successors; (iv) shares of any so
called "money market fund" or mutual fund which has its assets invested
primarily in investments of the type described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, including, without limitation, the JPMorgan Money Market Funds or any
other mutual fund for which the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow
Agent serves as investment manager, administrator, shareholder servicing agent
and/or custodian; or (v) any other investment as the Buyer, the Parent and
the Escrow Agent may mutually agree upon.



(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to execute purchases and sales
of Permitted Investments through the facilities of its own trading or capital
markets operations or those of any affiliated entity, including investment
orders involving U.S. Treasury obligations, commercial paper and other direct
investments executed through JPMorgan Fleming Asset Management ("JPMFAM"), of
the investment management division of JPMorgan Chase. Subject to principles of
best execution, transactions will be effected on behalf of the escrow account
through broker dealers selected by JPMFAM. In this regard, JPMFAM shall seek
to attain the best overall result for the Escrow Funds, taking into
consideration quality of service and reliability. The Escrow Agent shall send
an Escrow Statement to each of the Buyer and the Parent on a monthly basis
reflecting activity in the escrow account for the preceding month. Each
"Escrow Statement" shall set forth with respect to the period covered thereby
(A) the balance of the Escrow Funds (the "Escrow Balance") as of the
beginning of such period, (B) the Escrow Balance as of

 

2 ##### Table of Contents

  



the end of such period, (C) the amount of each release of Escrow Funds to the
Buyer under Section 4(b) and to the Parent under Section 4(c), 4(d) or 4(e)
during such period (and the identity of the Buyer Certificate or Tax
Certificate with respect to which each such release related, if applicable),
(D) the aggregate amount of interest and income earned on the Permitted
Investments of the Escrow Funds during such period and (E) the aggregate of
all Demand Amounts (as defined below) previously submitted to the Escrow Agent
with respect to which the Escrow Agent had neither released Escrow Funds to
the Buyer in accordance with Section 4(b)(ii) nor received a Determination (as
defined below) under Section 4(b)(iii) ("Pending Demand Amounts") as of the
end of such period. Although the Buyer and the Parent each recognize that it
may obtain a broker confirmation or written statement containing comparable
information at no additional cost, within three business days following any
securities transaction in the escrow account, and which reflects the amount of
the agency fee, the Buyer and the Parent hereby agree that confirmations of
Permitted Investments are not required to be issued by the Escrow Agent for
each month in which a monthly statement is rendered. The Buyer and the Parent
acknowledge and agree that the disbursement and release of Escrow Funds on
any particular date is subject to the sale and final settlement of Permitted
Investments. Proceeds of a sale of Permitted Investments will be delivered on
the business day on which the appropriate instructions are delivered to the
Escrow Agent if received prior to the applicable deadline for same day sale of
such Permitted Investments. If such instructions are received after the
applicable deadline, proceeds will be delivered on the next succeeding
business day.



(c) The Escrow Agent in its capacity as escrow agent hereunder shall not have
any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment of the
Escrow Funds made pursuant to the instructions of the parties hereto in
accordance with this Escrow Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any
investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of the parties to give
the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Funds or any
earnings thereon.



(d) The Buyer and the Parent recognize and agree that the Escrow Agent will
not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to either the
investment of the Escrow Funds or the purchase, sale, retention or other
disposition of any Permitted Investment.

 _Disbursement of Escrow Funds_ 

---|---|--- 



(a) _General_. Unless the Buyer earlier instructs the Escrow Agent in writing
to terminate the escrow and release the Escrow Funds to the Parent, the Escrow
Agent will hold the Escrow Funds in its possession, except as provided in
this Section 4.



(b) _Release of Escrow Funds for Indemnification Payments._



(i) The Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a copy of each Buyers
notice to the Parent (a "Buyers Indemnification Notice") delivered pursuant
to the Acquisition Agreement seeking

 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

indemnification under the Acquisition Agreement together with a certificate
(together, a "Buyer Certificate"). To the extent not included in a Buyers
Indemnification Notice, the related Buyers Certificate shall (i) specify in
reasonable detail the nature of the Indemnifiable Loss under the Acquisition
Agreement (including the section or sections of the Acquisition Agreement
upon which the Buyer is seeking indemnification), (ii) specify the amount, and
itemize in reasonable detail each component, of the Indemnifiable Loss, if
then reasonably ascertainable by the Buyer (the "Demand Amount"), or that the
amount of the Indemnifiable Loss is not reasonably ascertainable at that time,
(iii) specify whether such Indemnifiable Loss is a Third Party Claim, (iv)
demand that the Escrow Agent release an amount from the Escrow Funds equal to
the Demand Amount, if specified, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account specified in the Buyer Certificate, and (v) certify
that the Buyer has delivered a copy of the Buyer Certificate to the Parent. 



(ii) Unless the Escrow Agent receives from the Parent a written notice of
objection to a Buyer Certificate (a copy of which shall be sent
contemporaneously to the Buyer by the Parent) within thirty calendar days
after receipt of the related Buyers Indemnification Notice, the Escrow Agent
shall release to the Buyer, in satisfaction of the Demand Amount set forth in
such Buyer Certificate, Escrow Funds equal to the Demand Amount in accordance
with the instructions set forth in the Buyer Certificate. In any written
notice of objection to a Buyer Certificate, the Parent may state an objection
to all or a portion of the Demand Amount sought in such Buyer Certificate. If
the Parent objects to only a portion of such Demand Amount, such notice of
objection shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release, and the Escrow Agent
shall release, to the Buyer in accordance with this Section 4(b)(ii) Escrow
Funds equal to that portion of the Demand Amount that is not contested by the
Parent.



(iii) In the event that the Parent delivers to each of the Escrow Agent and
the Buyer a written notice of objection to any Buyer Certificate within the
time period specified in Section 4(b)(ii), the Escrow Agent shall not release
the amount of Escrow Funds relating to the contested portion of the Demand
Amount until the Escrow Agent receives a Determination. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Determination" shall mean: (x) a written settlement or other
joint instruction from the Buyer and the Parent, or (y) a binding arbitration
award or a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States
of America (the time for appeal having expired and no appeal having been
perfected), or in the case of Indemnifiable Losses relating to Taxes, a final
determination of the appropriate Taxing authority with respect to the Tax
amount in dispute. In all cases, the Determination shall indicate the amount
of Escrow Funds from the escrow account to be released to the Buyer, or that
no Escrow

 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  



Funds are to be released to the Buyer. In the event Escrow Funds are to
be released to the Buyer, the Determination shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent together with wire transfer instructions from the Buyer so that the
Escrow Agent may wire transfer immediately available funds in the amount
specified in the Determination to the bank account specified in the wire
transfer instructions by the Buyer.



(iv) If the Escrow Funds are insufficient to pay all Demand Amounts, the
Parent agrees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Acquisition Agreement, (i) to honor the indemnity of the Buyer with respect to
the Demand Amount and (ii) to pay the amount of such insufficiency.

 _Rights of the Escrow Agent_ 

---|---|--- 



(a) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth herein and no other or further duties or responsibilities
shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no duty
to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Escrow
Agreement.



(b) The Escrow Agent may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any written notice, instruction or request furnished to it
hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be under no
duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any
such document. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments
which may be due it hereunder. 



(c) No person, firm or corporation will be recognized by the Escrow Agent as a
successor or assignee of the Buyer or the Parent until there shall be
presented to the Escrow Agent evidence satisfactory to it of such succession
or assignment. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual
capacity may be merged or

 

7 ##### Table of Contents

  

converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which
substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.



(d) The Buyer and the Parent shall each execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent a certificate of incumbency substantially in the form of Exhibit A
hereto for the purpose of establishing the identity of the persons authorized
to give instructions, certificates and notices hereunder and otherwise to act
on behalf of such party, which certificates shall contain specimens of such
persons signatures. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable
for acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, instruction or
request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent
shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy
or content of any such document. In the event of any change in the identity
of such representatives, a new certificate of incumbency shall be executed and
delivered to the Escrow Agent by the appropriate party. Until such time as the
Escrow Agent shall receive a new incumbency certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall be fully protected in relying without inquiry on any then current
incumbency certificate on file with the Escrow Agent.



(e) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act it may do or omit to do
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the Escrow Agents negligence, bad faith or gross or willful misconduct was
the primary cause of any loss to the Buyer or the Parent. The Escrow Agent may
execute any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or
through agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel, accountants
and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in its reasonable
good faith judgment in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons.



(f) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action
and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow
until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by each of the other parties
hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction;
and shall be permitted to interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a
court of competent jurisdiction, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and
all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets. The
parties hereto other than the Escrow Agent further agree to pursue any
redress or recourse in connection with such a dispute without making the
Escrow Agent a party to it.



(g) The compensation of the Escrow Agent shall be as set forth in Schedule I.
The Buyer and the Parent shall each be responsible for one-half of said
compensation. The Buyer and the Parent shall jointly pay or reimburse the
Escrow Agent upon request

 

8 ##### Table of Contents

  

for all expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses, incurred or made by it in connection with the preparation,
execution, performance, delivery, modification and termination of this Escrow
Agreement (with the Buyer and the Parent each being responsible for one-half),
except as a result of the Escrow Agents own negligence, bad faith or gross
or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall not be entitled to set off or
deduct any unpaid fees and/or non-reimbursed expenses from the Escrow Funds.



(h) The Buyer and the Parent shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its employees, directors, representatives,
officers and agents from all loss, liability or expense (including the fees
and expenses of in-house or outside counsel) arising out of or in connection
with (i) the Escrow Agents execution and performance of the Escrow Agreement,
to the extent that such loss, liability or expense is not due to the
negligence, bad faith or gross or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent, or
(ii) its following any instructions or other directions from the Buyer or the
Parent, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or
direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Escrow Agreement. The
Buyer and the Parent agree to reimburse each other for one-half of any
payments made by them pursuant to this Section 7(h) with respect to
liabilities for which the parties are jointly liable pursuant to this Section
7(h).



 

(i) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties hereunder at
any time by giving written notice of such resignation to the Buyer and the
Parent specifying a date (not less than thirty days after the giving of such
notice) when such resignation shall take effect and upon delivery of the
Escrow Funds to the successor escrow agent designated by the Buyer and the
Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Agent shall have the right to
withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Escrow Agent, plus
any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe may be
incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the termination of the Escrow
Agreement. Promptly after such notice, a successor escrow agent shall be
appointed by the mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Parent, such successor
escrow agent to become Escrow Agent hereunder upon the resignation date
specified in such notice. If the Buyer and the Parent are unable to agree upon
a successor escrow agent within thirty days after such notice, the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to appoint its successor. The Escrow Agent
shall continue to serve until its successor has received the Escrow Funds and
has accepted by written notice to the Buyer and the Parent the terms and
conditions of this Escrow Agreement. The Buyer and the Parent may agree at any
time to substitute a new escrow agent by giving notice thereof to the Escrow
Agent then acting. Upon its resignation and delivery of the Escrow Funds as
set forth in this Section 6(i), the Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and
from any and all further obligations arising in connection with the escrow
contemplated by this Escrow Agreement.

 _Taxation_ 

---|---|--- 



(a) On or prior to the date of this Escrow Agreement, the Buyer and the
Parent, for purposes of United States backup withholding tax and information
reporting requirements, will provide the Escrow Agent with an executed copy
of Internal Revenue Service form W-9 (for United States persons) or form W-8
(for non-United States persons) or any successor forms (as may be required by
the Escrow Agent). The Buyer and the Parent agree to provide replacement forms
if originals of any form previously provided become obsolete or incomplete.
Each of the Buyer and the Parent represent that the Taxpayer Identification
Number ("TIN") assigned to it by the Internal Revenue Service and provided to
the Escrow Agent is correct. Each of the Buyer and the Parent agrees that all
interest or other income earned under the Escrow Agreement shall be allocated
to the Parent and so reported to the Internal Revenue Service and any other
applicable taxing authority, except to the extent that any law or regulation
should otherwise require.



(b) The Escrow Agent shall report to the Internal Revenue Service, as of each
calendar year-end, all income earned from the investment of any sum held in
the Escrow Account for the Parent whether or not said income has been
distributed during such year, as and to the extent required by law.

(c) Any tax returns required to be prepared and filed will be prepared and
filed by the Parent with the Internal Revenue Service in all years income is
earned by the escrow account, whether or not income is received or distributed
in any particular tax year, and the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility
for the preparation and/or filing of any tax return with respect to any income
earned by the Escrow Account.

(d) The Parent shall pay all taxes payable on income earned from the
investment of any sums held in the Escrow Account whether or not the Escrow
Agent distributed the income during any particular year.

 _Miscellaneous Provisions_ 

---|---|--- 



(a) As of the date that the Escrow Agent has delivered either to the Parent
and/or the Buyer in accordance with the provisions hereof the entire amount of
the Escrow Funds, this Escrow Agreement shall terminate, except that the
provisions of Section 6(e) through Section 6(i) and Section 7 shall survive
such termination.



(b) In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than at the time
of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by email,
telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation
of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons
designated on Schedule II attached hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon
the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so
designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed
only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely
upon

 

10 ##### Table of Contents

  

any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Buyer or
the Parent to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank, or
(iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the Escrow Funds
for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even
where its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid,
or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an
intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge
that these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

 



(c) The Buyer and the Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve promptly
any dispute arising hereunder.

 



(d) The section headings contained in this Escrow Agreement are solely for the
purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties and shall
not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Escrow Agreement.



(e) This Escrow Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement embody the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Escrow Agreement. There are no restrictions,
promises, representations, warranties or undertakings, other than those
expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein. This Escrow Agreement
supercedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with
respect to such transactions. 



(f) All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be deemed given if delivered personally or mailed by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, telecopied (and
which is confirmed) or sent by any reputable courier (providing proof of
delivery) to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address
for a party as shall be specified by like notice, provided that notices of a

(g) This Escrow Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.



(j) This Escrow Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Escrow Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, nor is
this Escrow Agreement intended to confer upon any other person except the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.



(g) This Escrow Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware (regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law) as to all matters, including but not limited
to matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies. 



(j) Except as otherwise provided in this Escrow Agreement, any failure of the
parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,

 

12 ##### Table of Contents

  

or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this
Escrow Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such
consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements
for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section 8(j).



(k) This Escrow Agreement is not intended to and shall not be construed to
give any person (other than the parties to this Escrow Agreement) any interest
or rights (including, without limitation, any third party beneficiary rights)
with respect to or in connection with any agreement or provision contained
herein or contemplated hereby.



(l) Subject to applicable Law, this Escrow Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by written agreement of Parent, the Buyer and the Escrow
Agent.



(m) If for any reason any term or provision of this Escrow Agreement is held
to be invalid or unenforceable, all other valid terms and provisions hereof
shall remain in full force and effect, and all of the terms and provisions of
this Escrow Agreement shall be deemed severable in nature. If for any reason
any term or provision containing a restriction set forth herein is held to
cover an area or to be for a length of time which is unreasonable, or in any
other way is construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such term or
provision shall not be determined to be null, void and of no effect, but to
the extent the same is or would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law,
any court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform
this Escrow Agreement to provide for a restriction having the maximum
enforceable area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those
contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law.
