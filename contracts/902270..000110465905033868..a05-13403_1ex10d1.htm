reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records of
Company and each Company Subsidiary, upon reasonable prior notice, and

access shall be conducted at Buyers expense, under the reasonable
supervision of Companys personnel and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of such information and not to interfere with the normal
operation of the business of Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
none of Company, any Company Subsidiary or Seller shall have any obligation
to disclose any information to Buyer to the extent such disclosure would (a)
result in a material breach of any Contract to which Company, such Company

expected to jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege of
Company, such Company Subsidiary or Seller, or (c) result in a violation of

to Buyer or its authorized representatives pursuant hereto shall be subject

### 

  

## **7.4** ** Consents.** Prior to Closing, Seller, Company and Buyer shall
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents, permits, approvals of, and exemptions by, any Governmental Body and
all consents of any third party, in each case, necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Seller
and its Affiliates (including Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall not
be required to expend any money to obtain such consents, and _provided
further_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions of Seller and
Buyer with respect to filings, approvals and other matters pursuant to the
HSR Act and any local, state, federal (other than the HSR Act) or foreign
antitrust Law applicable to the Share Purchase ( **"Other Antitrust
Regulations")** shall be governed by Section 7.5. Each of the parties hereto
shall diligently assist and cooperate in preparing and filing all documents
required to be submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such
transactions and in obtaining any consents, waivers, authorizations or
approvals which may be required to be obtained in connection with such
transactions. With respect to the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) ISRA approval referred to in Sections 8.3 and 9.3, Seller,
at its cost, will cause Company to file such notices,
assessments, remediation

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

## agreement applications and other documents and information required for
review by NJDEP in order to allow Seller to transfer ownership of Company to
Buyer prior to Companys compliance with ISRA. Seller will obtain Buyers
input and approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, in regards to any ISRA
filing. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and execute and deliver to NJDEP
such information, certificates and other information as may be required under
ISRA. Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain approval by NJDEP of
an ISRA remediation agreement and funding source to be provided by and in the
name of Company, if required, that are limited to the existing remediation
work at the Pomona property and an ISRA remediation funding source not to
exceed Companys existing estimated reserves for Pomona. If, however, NJDEP
requires an ISRA remediation funding source in excess of Companys existing
estimated reserves for Pomona, Buyer agrees that Company will provide an ISRA
remediation funding source in the amount required by NJDEP.

  



  

## **7.5** ** HSR Act.** Seller and Buyer shall each promptly prepare and
file any notifications and reports which may be required with respect to this
Agreement by the HSR Act, including a request for early termination of the
waiting period, and respond promptly to inquiries from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice resulting from the filings of such
notifications, and otherwise shall use their best efforts to comply with the
requirements of such Act.  Buyer shall pay the fee required for filing such
notification. If any Governmental Body requests information or documents
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party agrees
to consult with the other partys counsel about any communications with such
Governmental Body (in advance, where practicable, and in any event promptly),
to use its reasonable best efforts to respond appropriately to such request,
as soon as reasonably practicable, to cooperate with the other party in
responding to any request, and to allow the other party to participate
in meetings with any Governmental Body. The parties hereto shall use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts and take all necessary action
to obtain any clearance under the HSR Act or other authorization of any
Governmental Body required under Other Antitrust Regulations in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or to resolve any objections that
may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. In order to avoid any Governmental Body from filing
suit, or taking any other action, to forbid or delay consummation of
the transaction, Buyer shall offer undertakings acceptable to the relevant
Governmental Body, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of, or the imposition of any limitation upon, such
assets or businesses of Buyer (including its subsidiaries) or Company or any
Company Subsidiary (so long as conditioned upon, and not occurring prior to,
the Closing), along with any ancillary agreements.

  

## 

  

## **7.6** ** Public Statements. **Except as required by applicable Law or
securities exchange rules (in which event the parties shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with each other in advance), prior to the
Closing Date, no press release or other public announcement (if materially
different than those previously made) relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be made by any party to this Agreement
or its representatives without prior consultation among Seller and Buyer.

  

## 

  

## **7.7** ** Satisfaction of Company Debt.** At or before Closing, Seller
shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of Company, all indebtedness
for borrowed money of Company or any Company Subsidiary, and shall obtain the
release of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

## Encumbrances) securing such indebtedness, _provided_  that the $150,000
conditional loan from the Maryland Department of Business and Economic
Development and the $100,000 conditional grant from Washington
County, Maryland shall not be considered to be "indebtedness for borrowed
money" for purposes of this Section 7.7.

  

## 

  

## **7.8** ** Satisfaction of Conditions.**

  

## 

  

### (a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to Closing set forth
in Articles 8 and 9 below to be satisfied, to the extent within the control
of such party.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, Buyer shall use its
best efforts to cause the condition to Closing set forth in Section 8.6
(Financing) below to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, including using
its best efforts to satisfy all conditions within the control of Buyer that
are required to obtain such financing under the Commitment Letter; _provided_
that in the event that such financing is not obtained from the sources
referred to in the Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its best efforts to
obtain financing from other sources as promptly as practicable (it being
understood that Buyer will not be required to accept financing that would be
on economic terms (including restrictive covenants) that would be materially
worse in the aggregate to Buyer than the economic terms associated with the
financing available to Buyer under the Commitment Letter). In furtherance and
not in limitation of the preceding sentence, prior to Closing, Buyer shall
not undertake any acquisition of any business, division or material assets
(other than inventory in the ordinary course of business); incur, assume,
guarantee or otherwise become liable for any indebtedness or other
liabilities other than trade payables or borrowings under existing lines of
credit, in each case, in the ordinary course; or undertake any other
transaction outside the ordinary course of business that would reasonably be
expected to impair, delay or prevent Buyers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including its ability to obtain financing
for payment of the Purchase Price.

  

### 

  

## **7.9** ** No Sale.** Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms),
Seller agrees not to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise place any
Encumbrance on the Shares.

  

## 

  

## **7.10** ** No Negotiations.**

  

## 

  

### (a) Until the earliest to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, and shall
direct the officers of Company and Sellers agents or representatives,
including Goldman Sachs and Co., not to solicit any proposal, indication of
interest or offer from any Person (including any of the officers or employees
of Company) relating to any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization,
merger, consolidation or acquisition or purchase of all or a material portion
of the assets (other than inventory in the ordinary course of business) of,
or any equity interest in, Company or other similar transaction or business
combination involving the Business, or participate in any negotiations
regarding any such transaction; _provided_ , however, that if Seller, after 60
days from the date of this Agreement, determines in good faith that Buyer
will not likely be able to consummate the Closing by the date this Agreement
terminates in accordance with its terms, Seller may provide Buyer with
written notice of such determination, following which notice

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

### Buyer and Seller will, within five business days, consult with each other
regarding the prospects for consummating the Closing.  If, following such
consultation, Seller in good faith again determines that Buyer will not
likely be able to consummate the Closing by the date this Agreement
terminates in accordance with its terms, Seller may provide Buyer with a
written notice regarding such determination and Sellers obligations under
this Section 7.10 will cease ten days following Buyers receipt of such
second written notice.

  

### 

  

### (b) The foregoing subsection (a) shall not preclude Seller, or
Sellers agents or representatives from taking any action to solicit any
proposal, indication of interest or offer from any Person relating to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any liquidation, dissolution,
recapitalization, merger, consolidation or acquisition or purchase of all or
a material portion of the assets of, or any equity interest in, Seller taken
as a whole or any Subsidiary of Seller (other than Company and Company
Subsidiaries), or other similar transaction or business combination involving
an interest in Seller taken as a whole or any Subsidiary of Seller (other
than Company and Company Subsidiaries).

information and data concerning Company and Company Subsidiaries and make
available such knowledgeable employees of Company and Company Subsidiaries as

Company Subsidiaries to, retain all Tax Returns, books and records (including

fails to accept such offer within 60 days of its being made.

  

### 

  

### (i) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries
to, cooperate in the preparation of all Tax Returns relating in whole or in
part to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are required to
be filed after such date and all Tax Returns for Tax periods beginning before
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date; _provided_ that Seller

Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Other Tax Return of Company or any
Company Subsidiary, in each case, for any Tax period, or portion thereof,

promptly forward to Seller any communications

### received from or sent to any Taxing Authority in connection with any such
Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall have the right to control, contest, resolve and
defend any Tax Proceeding (including having the right to determine whether
and when to settle any Tax Proceeding) which may affect the amount of Taxes
for which Seller is liable (or refunds to which Seller is entitled) hereunder
or otherwise, _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that, to the extent that such Tax
Proceeding may reasonably be expected to affect a material amount of Taxes
for which Buyer is liable (or refunds to which Buyer is entitled) hereunder,
__ Seller shall keep Buyer informed in a timely manner of all material
actions taken or proposed to be taken by Seller with respect to such Tax
Proceeding and shall consult with Buyer and offer Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to comment before submitting any material written materials
prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding
any other provision, neither Buyer, Company nor any of their respective
subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any United States consolidated federal Income Tax
Return which includes Seller or any other consolidated, combined or unitary
Tax Return which includes any member of the Seller Group, nor shall Buyer,
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates be entitled to
any information, except to the extent relating solely to Company or Company
Subsidiaries, regarding any such Tax Return (or any Tax Returns of Seller).

  

### 

  

### (k)

  

### 

  

#### (1) Buyer agrees that if as the result of any audit adjustment (or
adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) made with respect to any Tax Item
which relates to any Tax for which Seller is responsible under Section
11.3(c), by any Taxing Authority with respect to a Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including Company and Company Subsidiaries, receives a Tax
Benefit, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit within
15 days of filing the Tax Return in which such Tax Benefit is realized or
utilized.  For purposes of determining the amount and timing of any Tax
Benefit, the recipient of the Tax Benefit shall be deemed to pay Tax at the
actual tax rate in effect in the year such Tax Benefit is realized or
utilized and shall be deemed to realize or utilize any Tax Benefit in the
first taxable year that such Tax Benefit may be realized or utilized under
Law.

  

#### 

  

#### (2) Seller shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit arising from any
deduction arising in respect of any expense, liability or Loss that is borne
or paid by Seller or for which Seller is responsible pursuant to this
Agreement (each such expense, liability or Loss, a **"Seller Expense"**
) and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall claim any such deduction on any Tax Return that is the
responsibility of Buyer pursuant to Section 11.3(f); provided, however, that
if any deduction arising in respect of any Seller Expense is not permitted by
Law or administrative practice to be reported on a Tax Return for which
Seller has filing

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

#### responsibility and is permitted by Law or administrative practice to be
reported on any Tax Return that is the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to
Section 11.3(f), then Buyer shall claim such deduction and pay to Seller the
amount of any Tax Benefit that results from such deduction.

  

#### 

  

### (l) Claims for indemnification with respect to Taxes shall be governed by
this Section 11.3 and Sections 13.2(b), 13.4, 13.5 and 13.6 (but not any
other provision of Article 13). It is agreed and understood that the
rights set forth in this Section 11.3 in respect of Taxes are the
exclusive remedy and allocation in respect of Taxes in connection with
this Agreement. The representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.19
shall survive the Closing until six months after expiration of the state and
federal statute of limitations applicable to the matters covered thereby.

  

### 

  

### (m) For the absence of doubt, the covenants of Buyer, Company and Company
Subsidiaries set forth in this Section 11.3 shall apply to Buyer, Company and

manner consistent with _Schedule 11.3(n)_ and §§ 338 and 1060 of the Code

subsidiaries and Affiliates to, treat the assets and capital stock of the UK
Subsidiary that have been distributed by Company to Seller, as referred to in
Section 5.18(a) of this Agreement, and any cash or intercompany receivables
distributed by Company to Seller pursuant to Section 11.5 of this Agreement,

of state or local Tax Law).

#### (5) In furtherance of this Section 11.3(n):

  

#### 

  

##### (A) prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall prepare IRS Form 8023 (
**"Form 8023"**) on which the 338(h)(10) Elections shall be made for U.S.

##### 

  

##### (B) at or prior to Closing, Seller (and such of its subsidiaries as are
necessary) and Buyer (and such of its subsidiaries as are necessary) shall
execute Form 8023, which Buyer and Seller shall promptly file or cause to be
filed with the Internal Revenue Service;

  

##### 

  

##### (C) upon Sellers request, Seller, Buyer and such of their respective
subsidiaries as are necessary shall cooperate in the preparation and timely
filing of any corrections, amendments or supplements to Form 8023, including
IRS Form 8883 ( **"Form 8883"**); and

  

##### 

  

##### (D) Seller, Buyer and such of their respective subsidiaries as are

#### filed without the consent of the other party so long as such form is
filed in a manner that incorporates, reflects and is consistent with
_Schedule 11.3(n)_.

  

#### 

  

## **11.4** ** Environmental Obligations.**

  

## 

  

### (a) Effective as of Closing, Seller hereby assumes and agrees to carry
out and be responsible for the following:

  

### 

  

#### (1) those Remediation obligations of Company or Company Subsidiaries
that are described on _Schedule 11.4_;

  

#### 

  

#### (2) Environmental Claims, Environmental Damages and Remediation
obligations (whether now known or subsequently discovered and without regard
to disclosures made in the Disclosure Schedule or the Reports) of Company or
a Company Subsidiary related to the ownership or operation of any property
that was owned or operated prior to the Closing Date by Company, a Company
Subsidiary or any entity that merged into Company or a current or former
subsidiary of Company, but which property is not owned or operated by Company
or a Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date; and

  

#### 

  

#### (3) Environmental Claims, Environmental Damages and Remediation
obligations (whether now known or subsequently discovered and without regard
to disclosures made in the Disclosure Schedule or the Reports) of Company or
a Company Subsidiary related to the disposal at other locations of Hazardous
Substances from any property described in subsection (a)(2) above.

  

#### 

  

### (b) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that the assumption by
Seller set forth in subsection (a) will not include (and, effective as of
Closing, Buyer assumes and will, or will cause Company to, carry out and be
responsible for) Environmental Claims, Environmental Damages or Remediation
obligations related to facilities or properties now owned or operated by
Company or a Company Subsidiary or related to disposal at other locations of
Hazardous Substances from such facilities or properties, unless the
Environmental Claim, Environmental Damages or Remediation obligation is
expressly described on _Schedule 11.4_.

  

### 

  

### (c) Following Closing, Buyer will (or will cause Company and Company
Subsidiaries to), upon request, provide Seller, its Affiliates, attorneys,
consultants and other representatives reasonable access during normal working
hours to the books, records and personnel of Company or Company Subsidiaries
relating to such assumed Remediation obligations and the related operations,
facilities and properties of Company and Company Subsidiaries.  Prior to
disposing of any such books or records, Buyer will (or will cause Company to)
give Seller a reasonable opportunity to take possession thereof.

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

### (d) Any claim for indemnification or other claim arising under this
Section 11.4 shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Sections 13.3,
13.4, 13.5 and 13.6 (but not by any other provisions of Article 13).

  

### 

  

## **11.5** ** Cash Sweep.** In the ordinary course of business, all cash
balances remaining in Companys bank accounts after the payment of
obligations due are transferred each business day on a same day basis to
Seller. Each such transfer of cash between Company and Seller is recorded as
a receivable or payable, as applicable, on each entitys accounting records.
Any cash balances remaining in Companys or Companys Subsidiaries bank
accounts, after the payment of normal obligations then due, on the last
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date will be transferred on
the Closing Date to an account designated by Seller. Deposits into such
accounts of Company or Company Subsidiaries made on and after the Closing
Date will not be transferred to Seller. In addition, any payable balance on
the accounting records of Seller representing sweeps of cash from Company or
Company Subsidiaries will be cleared on the last business day preceding
Closing in the form of a dividend from Company to Seller and any cash that
had previously been swept to Seller will remain with Seller.

  

## 

  

## **11.6** ** Confidentiality.**

  

## 

  

### (a) **"Confidential Information"** means the following types of
information concerning the Business and affairs of Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the extent that Company currently treats such information as
proprietary and confidential in the ordinary course of business:

  

### 

  

#### (1) the Intellectual Property, including product specifications,
formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches, photographs, graphs,
drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past, current and planned research
and development, current and planned manufacturing and distribution methods
and processes, customer lists, current and anticipated customer requirements,
price lists, market studies, business plans, Software, database
technologies, systems, structures, architectures and data (and related
processes, formulae, compositions, improvements, devices, know-how,
inventions, discoveries, concepts, ideas, designs, methods and information)
of the Business,

  

#### 

  

#### (2) any and all information of Company concerning the Business
(including historical financial statements, financial projections and
budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending budgets and plans,
the names and backgrounds of key personnel, personnel training and techniques
and materials), other than in connection with Sellers financial reporting,
and

  

#### 

  

#### (3) any and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and
other material containing or based, in whole or in part, on any information
of Company included in the foregoing.

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

Information that is available to the public (other than as a result of any
breach of this Agreement by Seller or its Affiliates) is not Confidential
Information.

  



  

### (b) For a period of three years after the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates will keep confidential all of the Confidential Information, and
refrain from using or disclosing any of the Confidential Information, except
to the extent reasonably required in connection with the performance of any
of its duties or enforcement of any of its rights under this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) Seller agrees that the provisions and restrictions contained in
Section 11.6(b) hereof are necessary to protect the legitimate continuing
interests of Buyer in acquiring the Business and entering into this
Agreement, that agreements contained in Section 11.6(b) have been
specifically bargained for, that any violation or breach of such provisions
and restrictions will result in irreparable injury to Buyer for which a
remedy at law may be inadequate and that, in addition to any relief at law
which may be available to Buyer for such violation or breach and regardless
of any other provision contained in this Agreement, Buyer will be entitled to
injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation or breach
(without any requirement that Buyer provide any bond or other security if
such injunction or other relief is awarded after an evidentiary hearing at
which Seller has the opportunity to be present and heard).

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller is requested or required (in
connection with any Proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller
shall notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may
seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions
of Section 11.6(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt
of a waiver hereunder, Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal, Seller may disclose
the Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided, however_ , that
Seller will use its best efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of
Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Buyer designates.

  

### 

  

### (e) Effective upon the Closing, Seller shall assign to Buyer all of
Sellers right, title and interest in and to any confidentiality agreements
to which Seller or any of its agents is a party relating to the
confidentiality of information of the Business or the hiring of employees of
Company.

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

## **11.7** ** Noncompete; Nonsolicit.**

  

## 

  

### (a) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement and as
additional consideration for the consideration to be paid to Seller under
this Agreement, for a period of three years from the Closing Date, Seller
will not directly or indirectly engage in, acquire, own or hold a business
anywhere in the United States, Canada or Mexico that engages in the Business
in competition with Company (the " **Seller Restricted Business**
"), including as a proprietor, principal, agent, partner, officer,
director, stockholder, employee, member of any association, consultant or
otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that Kentucky Ceramics,
LLC (d/b/a "Louisville Stoneware"), which is owned by family members of the
Chairman of Sellers Board of Directors and trusts for their or his benefit,
is not covered by this subsection (a).

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (a), Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall not be precluded from directly or indirectly:

  

### 

  

#### (1) acquiring or owning interests in or securities of any person for
passive investment purposes (whether or not such person is engaged in the
Seller Restricted Business) to the extent that such ownership does not confer
on Seller more than 10% of the equity or voting power of such person;

  

#### 

  

#### (2) acquiring interests in or securities of any person as an investment
by any pension fund or fund of any other benefit plan of Seller or its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is engaged in the Seller Restricted
Business;

  

#### 

  

#### (3) acquiring interests in or securities of any person _provided_
that not more than 35% of the consolidated revenues of such person (based on
its consolidated revenues for its most recently completed fiscal year prior
to the acquisition), were derived from engaging in the Seller Restricted
Business;

  

#### 

  

#### (4) engaging or proposing to engage in an acquisition of or by, or
business combination transaction or other similar transaction with, another
person (the **"Other Party"** ) or an acquisition of a portion of the equity
or assets of an Other Party, including any such acquisition, combination or
other similar transaction in which, after giving effect to the transaction,
Seller, its Subsidiaries or the persons surviving or resulting from such
acquisition, business combination or other similar transaction, as the case
may be (the **"Surviving Entity"** ), is engaged in the Seller Restricted
Business, _provided_ that, if more than 10% of the aggregated consolidated
revenues of the Surviving Entity, calculated on a pro forma basis based on
the respective aggregate consolidated revenues of each of the Seller Group
and the Other Party (or the portion of the assets thereof subject to
the transaction) in their respective most recently completed fiscal years
prior to completion of such acquisition, business combination or other
similar transaction, were derived,

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

#### directly or indirectly, from the Seller Restricted Business and Seller
is or controls the Surviving Entity, then Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, or to cause the Surviving Entity to, divest that
portion of the business of the Surviving Entity which is primarily engaged in
the Seller Restricted Business within 18 months of completion of such
acquisition, business combination or other similar transaction, provided that
no divestment is required to be made more than three years after the Closing
Date.

  

#### 

  

### (c) For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date, except as otherwise
agreed to in writing by Buyer, Seller agrees not to, and shall not cause or
permit any of Sellers Subsidiaries to directly or indirectly (i) solicit for
employment any employee of Buyer or Company or (ii) induce or attempt to
induce any customer or supplier of Buyer or Company to cease doing business
with Buyer or Company; _provided_ that solicitations through newspapers of
general circulation or similar means not targeted by Seller at the employees
of Buyer or Company shall not be deemed to be a breach of this subsection.

  

### 

  

### (d) The parties intend that each of the covenants contained in this
Section 11.7 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for
each state of the United States, each county of each state of the United
States and each province of Canada and Mexico. Except for geographic
coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to
the covenant contained in the preceding subsections of this Section 11.7. If,
in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the
separate covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in these
subsections, then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed
eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the
extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions
thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this Section
11.7 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations, or
the scope of this covenant permitted by applicable law, then such provisions
shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations, as the case
may be, permitted by applicable laws. The unenforceability of any other of
said covenants or provisions or of any other obligation of Seller or Buyer
hereunder, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Seller or
Buyer against the other whether predicated on this Agreement or
otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Seller or
Buyer of any of said covenants.

  

### 

  

### (e) It is understood and agreed that damages will be an inadequate remedy
in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by Seller of any of
the covenants of Seller in this Section 11.7, and that any such breach will
cause Buyer irreparable injury and damage.  Accordingly, Seller agrees that
Buyer shall be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies
otherwise available to Buyer, to injunctive and other such equitable relief
in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach of any of said
covenants by Seller (without any requirement that Buyer provide any bond or
other security if such injunction or other relief is awarded after an
evidentiary hearing at which Seller has the opportunity to be present and
heard).

  

### 

  

### (f) In addition, if (A) any third party (i) acquires 40% or more of
the voting securities of Seller, including by way of share purchase,
exchange offer, merger, other business combination or other similar
transaction with Seller, (ii) acquires all or substantially all of the assets
of Seller or (iii) otherwise acquires "control" of Seller, or (B) if any
other merger, business

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

### combination or other transaction occurs as a result of which (i) the
holders of the outstanding capital stock of Seller immediately prior to such
transaction beneficially own, after giving effect to such transaction, 60% or
less of the outstanding equity securities of the Surviving Entity of such
transaction (whether Seller, such other person party to such transaction or
the person surviving or resulting from such transaction) or (ii) the
individuals who, prior to the initiation of such transaction, constituted the
board of directors of Seller cease for any reason to constitute at least a
majority of the board of directors of the Surviving Entity of such
transaction, then nothing contained in this Section 11.7 shall be a
limitation on any activities of such third party or the Surviving Entity of
such transaction or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by,
controlling or under common control with, such third party or Surviving
Entity.

  

### 

  

## **11.8** ** Litigation Support.** In the event and for so long as Buyer
or Company is actively contesting or defending against any Proceeding in
connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act or transaction existing or occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date involving Company, Seller will reasonably cooperate in the
contest or defense, and provide testimony, if necessary in connection with
the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of Buyer (unless and
to the extent Buyer is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article
13).

  

## 

  

## **11.9** ** Insurance.** Following the Closing, any claims or
other matters involving insurance policies procured by Seller and insuring
Company, Company Subsidiaries or their respective operations, assets,
directors, officers and employees, and any proceeds of such insurance
policies, will be handled as set forth in Schedule 11.9, all of which is
incorporated herein by reference.

**"Employee Beneficiaries"** ) that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable
for each Employee Beneficiary than those provided to such individual
immediately prior to the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause Company, Company
Subsidiaries and their respective successors and assigns to honor all Company
Plans, subject to the right to amend, modify, alter or terminate any Company
Plan to the extent the terms of such Plan permit such action, except to the
extent any such action is contrary to any other provisions of this Article
12, and provided that if any such action is effective prior to December 31,
2006, Buyer must remain in compliance with Section 12.1(b) above.

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

### (d) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, practices or
arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Employee
Beneficiary after the Closing Date, each Employee Beneficiary shall be
credited with all years of service for which such Employee Beneficiary was
credited before the Closing Date under any similar employee benefit plans,
practices or arrangements of Seller and its Affiliates, except for purposes
of benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit plan;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the fact that Seller and its
Affiliates do not maintain a severance program, each Company employee shall
be credited with all years of service to Company and its Affiliates (and
their respective predecessors) for all purposes under any severance plan or
program of Buyer and its Affiliates.

  

### 

  

## **12.2** ** Welfare Plans.**

each Employee Beneficiary to enroll as of the Closing in Welfare Plans
sponsored by Buyer and its Affiliates (including for this purpose Company and
Company Subsidiaries) that are substantially similar to the Welfare Plans
applicable to such Employee Beneficiaries immediately prior to the Closing.
With respect to such coverage of Employee Beneficiaries under the Welfare
Plans of Buyer and its Affiliates:

  

### 

  

#### (1) limitations on benefits due to pre-existing conditions shall be
waived for any Employee Beneficiary enrolled in any Welfare Plan maintained
by Seller and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date,

  

#### 

  

#### (2) any out-of-pocket annual maximums and deductibles taken into account
under Welfare Plans maintained by Seller and its Affiliates for any Employee
Beneficiary in the calendar year which contains the Closing Date shall be
credited under the Welfare Plans of Buyer and its Affiliates for the same
calendar year, and

  

#### 

  

#### (3) with respect to aggregate lifetime maximum benefits available under
Welfare Plans of Buyer and its Affiliates, an Employee Beneficiarys prior
claim experience under Welfare Plans maintained by Seller and its Affiliates
will not be taken into account.

  

#### 

  

### (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Article 12 with respect to
specific benefits or Plans, after the Closing:

  

### 

  

#### (1) Seller and its Affiliates (excluding for this purpose Company and
Company Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for:

  

#### 

  

##### (A) claims for Welfare Benefits that are incurred by or with respect to
any Employee Beneficiary before the Closing Date; and

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

##### (B) claims relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to "qualifying
events" with respect to any Employee Beneficiary and his or her beneficiaries
and dependents that occur before the Closing Date; and

  

##### 

  

#### (2) Buyer and its Affiliates (including for this purpose Company and
Company Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for:

  

#### 

  

##### (A) claims for Welfare Benefits that are incurred by or with respect to
any Employee Beneficiary on or after the Closing Date, and

  

##### 

  

##### (B) claims relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to "qualifying
events" with respect to any Employee Beneficiary and his or her beneficiaries
and dependents that occur on or after the Closing Date.

  

##### 

  

#### (3) For purposes of the foregoing, a medical/dental claim shall be
considered incurred when the services are rendered, the supplies are provided
or medication is prescribed, and not when the condition arose.

  

#### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Company
employee covered by Sellers Short Term Disability Plan has become disabled
(within the meaning of such plan) prior to the Closing Date, any short-term
disability salary continuation income benefits relating to such disability
shall be the sole responsibility of Seller, whether payable before or after
the Closing Date. Sellers Long Term Disability Plan shall be responsible for
any Company employee covered by Sellers Long Term Disability Plan who has
become disabled (within the meaning of such plan) prior to Closing but has
not qualified for benefits because the elimination period has not
then expired, subject to the elimination period requirement being met after
Closing.

  

### 

  

### (d) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer, through Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, shall honor all vacation days of Company employees that
accrued prior to the Closing Date and that remain outstanding as of the
Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (e) The amount in each Company employees account under Sellers
Dependent Care Assistance Plan (which is part of Sellers Cafeteria Plan) as
of the Closing Date will be transferred by Seller as soon as practicable
after Closing to a plan to be set up by Company (or by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates for the benefit of Company employees) that provides equivalent or
better benefits to Company employees than Sellers Dependent Care Assistance
Plan.

  

### 

  

### (f) Subject to applicable Law, Seller shall cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts in assisting Buyers efforts to transition the
employees and Plans including providing access and making available to Buyer
employee records and benefit information necessary for Buyer to fulfill its
obligations under this Article 12, but such cooperation shall not require
Seller to incur out-of-pocket costs unless Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
therefor.

## **12.3** ** Severance Benefit.** Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide
each Company employee whose employment is terminated in a Qualifying
Termination during the period from the Closing Date through the first
anniversary of the Closing Date a payment of no less than the product of

  

## 

  

#### (1) such employees weekly rate of base pay, multiplied by

  

#### 

  

#### (2) the greater of

  

#### 

  

##### (A) 8, or

  

##### 

  

##### (B) such employees years of service with Company and its Affiliates
(including service with predecessor entities) multiplied by two, but not more
than 52,

  

##### 

  

as well as welfare benefits continuation (at no cost to the employee) for a
period of weeks not less than the multiple determined in clause (2) above. The
benefits described in this Section 12.3 are contingent on Company employees
signing a release agreement provided by Company. Payments will be made on
a semi-monthly basis in Companys normal payroll cycle and will be subject to
all applicable tax withholdings. This Section 12.3 does not apply with
respect to (i) any Company employee with whom Company has entered into a
retention agreement or other agreement providing for severance pay in an
amount equal to or greater than determined under this subsection, or (ii) any
Company employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

  



  

## **12.4** ** Omnibus Compensation Plans.** Outstanding equity awards to
Company employees under Sellers Omnibus Compensation Plan and Sellers 2004
Omnibus Compensation Plan will be honored by Seller in accordance with the
terms of such awards.

 INDEMNIFICATION**

  

# 

  

## **13.1** ** Survival.**

  

## 

  

### (a) All representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller contained
herein shall survive the Closing for a period of 18 months following the
Closing, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.19 (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing until six months after
the expiration of the state and federal statute of limitations applicable to
the matters covered thereby. The covenants and agreements of Seller or Buyer
contained in this Agreement shall survive, if at all, until, by their
respective terms, they are no longer effective (together with the dates in
the preceding sentence, each is referred to herein as a **"Survival Date"** ).

  

### 

  

### (b) In all instances with respect to any specific representation or
warranty under which an Indemnified Party shall have delivered a notice of a
claim prior to the Survival Date applicable to such representation or
warranty and as to which such claim has not been completely and finally
resolved prior to such termination date, such representation or warranty
shall survive for purposes of such claim for the period of time beyond such
termination date sufficient to resolve, completely and finally, the claim
relating to such representation or warranty

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

### in accordance with this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the parties agree that no claims or causes of action may be brought against
Seller or Buyer based upon the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement after the applicable Survival Date.

  

### 

  

## **13.2** ** Indemnification.**

  

## 

  

### (a) Seller shall indemnify, defend and save the Buyer Parties harmless
from, against, for and in respect of any damages, losses, obligations,
liabilities, claims and expenses (including interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses and all reasonable amounts paid in
investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing) (collectively,
**"Losses"** ) sustained or suffered by any of the Buyer Parties, whether or
not arising out of third party claims, arising from (i) a breach,
misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement or in the certificate to be delivered by Seller
pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of this Agreement, and (ii) any breach of any of
the covenants and agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement, including
any agreement of Seller to indemnify Buyer with respect to specific matters
contained elsewhere in this Agreement ( **"Buyer Damages"** ). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining whether Seller is obligated to provide indemnification under
Article 13 of this Agreement and for purposes of determining the amount of
Buyer Damages to which such indemnification applies, each representation and
warranty in this Agreement

  

### 

  

#### (1) (except Section 5.6(b), and

  

#### 

  

#### (2) except Section 5.9(a), clauses (a), (e) and (f) of Section 5.10,
Section 5.15(a), Section 5.16, Section 5.17(b) and the first sentence of
Section 5.17(d),  _provided_ that Sellers failure to list an item on the
Disclosure Schedule, when listing is required pursuant to such provisions
(taking into account the term "material" or "material adverse effect" or
similar phrases), shall not prevent other representations and warranties made
by Seller with respect to such item from applying to all such items
that should have been listed pursuant to such provisions (taking into account
the term "material" or "material adverse effect" or similar phrases)

  

#### 

  

and in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(a) of this
Agreement shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the term
"material" or "material adverse effect" or similar phrases contained in such
representation or warranty which has the effect of making such representation
and warranty less restrictive (as if such word(s) were deleted from such
representation and warranty).

  



  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
following limitations shall apply with reference to any indemnification claim
against Seller under Sections 13.2(a) or 11.3(c)(3) with respect to an
alleged breach of any representations or warranties:

  

### 

  

#### (1) No indemnification claim shall be brought against Seller unless
Buyer, at any time prior to the applicable Survival Date, gives Seller
written notice, with reasonable specificity, of the existence

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

#### of any such indemnification claim. Subject to the procedures
with respect to Claims under Section 13.3 hereof which shall in all
events govern third party claims (or Section 11.3(j) in the case of Taxes),
if such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of Buyer
Damages claimed and Seller notifies Buyer that Seller does not dispute the
claim described in such notice or fails to notify Buyer within 60 days after
receipt of such notice by Seller whether Seller disputes the claim described
in such notice, Seller shall be responsible for the payment of such Buyer
Damages to the Buyer Party. If Seller has timely disputed Sellers liability
with respect to such claim by delivery of notice in accordance with this
section, Buyer and Seller will proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute.  Any written notice delivered by Seller to Buyer
for purposes of disputing a claim for Buyer Damages shall, to the extent
practicable, provide an explanation with reasonable specificity for any
objection to the matters set forth in Buyers notice and the portion of the
claim (if less than all) which is the subject of the dispute notice.

  

#### 

  

#### (2) No indemnification shall be made under Sections 13.2(a)(i) or
11.3(c)(3) by Seller (i) for any individual item or group of substantially
similar items where the Loss or Tax relating thereto is less than $200,000
(the **"Basket"** ) and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of
determining whether the Threshold Amount has been exceeded pursuant to
Section 13.2(b)(2)(ii), and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of the
Losses and Taxes suffered by the Buyer Parties exceeds 2% of the Purchase
Price (the **"Threshold Amount"** ), and then only to the extent of any such
excess.

  

#### 

  

#### (3) The amount of Loss or Tax suffered by the Buyer Parties shall be
determined after offsetting the amount of any applicable reserve or allowance
included in the Financial Statements, and any Tax Benefit, insurance proceeds
or third party indemnification received.

  

#### 

  

#### (4) The amount of Losses or Taxes from a matter shall be reduced to the
extent such matter is reflected in the final determination of the Adjustment
Amount pursuant to Article 2.

  

#### 

  

#### (5) Sellers liability for all such indemnification claims shall in no
event exceed 10% of the Purchase Price (the **"Cap Amount"** ), except in
the event that such obligation to indemnify arises from fraud by Seller.

  

#### 

  

### (c) Seller will pay the amount of any Buyer Damages to the Buyer Party
within ten days following the determination of Sellers liability for and the
amount of such Buyer

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

### Damages (whether such determination is made pursuant to the procedures
set forth in this Article 13, by agreement between Buyer and Seller, by
arbitration award or by final adjudication in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement). Seller agrees that if, following the Closing, any payment
is made by Seller in respect of any Buyer Damages, (i) Seller shall have no
rights against Company or any Company Subsidiary arising out of any pre-
Closing action or omission, whether by reason of contribution,
indemnification, subrogation or otherwise, in respect of any such payment,
and shall not take any action against Company or any Company Subsidiary with
respect thereto, and (ii) any rights with respect to any such payment that
Seller may, by operation of law or otherwise, have against Company or any
Company Subsidiary arising out of any pre-Closing action or omission shall,
effective at the time of the Closing, be deemed hereby to be expressly and
knowingly waived.

  

### 

  

### (d) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and save the Seller Parties harmless
from, against, for and in respect of any Losses sustained or suffered by any
of the Seller Parties ( **"Seller Parties"** ) and arising from (i) a
breach, misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in the certificate to be delivered by
Buyer pursuant to Section 3.4(a), and (ii) any breach of any of the covenants
and agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement, including any agreement
of Buyer to indemnify Seller with respect to specific matters contained
elsewhere in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
following limitations shall apply with reference to any indemnification claim
against Buyer under Section 13.2(d) with respect to an alleged breach of any
representations or warranties:

  

### 

  

#### (1) No indemnification claim shall be brought against Buyer unless
Seller, at any time prior to the applicable Survival Date, gives Buyer
written notice, with reasonable specificity, of the existence of any such
indemnification claim. Subject to the procedures with respect to Claims
under Section 13.3 hereof which shall in all events govern third party
claims, if such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of
Seller Damages claimed and Buyer notifies Seller that Buyer does not dispute
the claim described in such notice or fails to notify Seller within 60 days
after receipt of such notice by Buyer whether Buyer disputes the
claim described in such notice, Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of
such Seller Damages to the Seller Party. If Buyer has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim by delivery of a notice Seller and Buyer
will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. Any
written notice delivered by Buyer to Seller for purposes of disputing a claim
for Seller Damages shall, to the extent practicable, provide an explanation
with reasonable specificity for any objection to the matters set forth in the
Seller notice and the portion of the claim (if less than all) which is the
subject of the dispute notice.

  

#### 

  

#### (2) No indemnification shall be made under Section 13.2(d)(i) by Buyer
(i) for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

#### less than the Basket and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes
of determining whether the Threshold Amount has been exceeded pursuant to
Section 13.2(e)(2)(ii), and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of the
Losses suffered by the Seller Parties exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then
only to the extent of any such excess.

  

#### 

  

#### (3) Buyers liability for all such indemnification claims shall in no
event exceed the Cap Amount, except in the event that such obligation to
indemnify arises from fraud by Buyer.

  

#### 

  

### (f) Buyer will pay the amount of any Seller Damages to Seller on behalf
of the Seller Parties within ten days following the determination of Buyers
liability for and the amount of Seller Damages (whether such determination is
made pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Article 13, by agreement
between Buyer and Seller, by arbitration award or by final adjudication in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement).

  

### 

  

## **13.3** ** Third Party Claims.** With respect to any claim for
indemnification resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (a
**"Claim"** ), the obligations and liabilities of the party allegedly
responsible for indemnification (the **"Indemnifying Party"** ) hereunder
with respect to the Claim by the party allegedly entitled to indemnity (the
**"Indemnified Party"** ) shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

  

## 

  

### (a) The Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of any assertion of liability by a third party which might
give rise to a Claim by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party
based on the indemnity agreements contained in Section 13.2 hereof, stating
the nature and basis of said assertion and the amount thereof, to the extent
known.

  

### 

  

### (b) If any Proceeding is brought against the Indemnified Party, with
respect to which the Indemnifying Party may have liability under the
indemnity agreement contained in Section 13.2 hereof, the Proceeding shall,
upon the written agreement of the Indemnifying Party, be defended (including
all Proceedings on appeal or for review which counsel for the defendant shall
deem appropriate) by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party
unless

  

### 

  

#### (1) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically
authorized by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such
Proceeding,

  

#### 

  

#### (2) the Indemnifying Party shall not have agreed, within 30 days after
the notice to it provided in subsection (a) above, to assume the defense of
such Proceeding, or

  

#### 

  

#### (3) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on
advice of counsel, that there may be defenses available to it which conflict
with those available to the Indemnifying Party;

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

in any of which events (A) that portion of such reasonable fees and expenses
reasonably related to matters covered by the indemnity agreement contained in
Section 13.2 hereof shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and (B) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall be
kept reasonably informed of such Proceeding at all stages thereof whether or
not it is so represented. The Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party and its attorneys, accountants and other representatives
all books and records of the Indemnified Party relating to such Proceedings
and the parties hereto agree to render to each other such assistance as they
may reasonably require of each other in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of any such Proceeding.

  



  

### (c) The Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement of any claims
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, provided, however, that the
Indemnified Partys consent shall not be required if the settlement involves
only payment of money and the settlement includes a full written release of
liability of the Indemnified Party with respect to such suit, proceeding or
claim. If an Indemnified Party does not consent to a settlement proposed by
the Indemnifying Party and accepted by the adverse third party that involves
only the payment of money by, or other consideration from, the Indemnifying
Party, the liability of the Indemnifying Party shall be limited to the amount
that would have been paid in such settlement. The Indemnified Party shall not
settle any claim for which it seeks indemnification without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent may be withheld in the sole
and absolute discretion of the Indemnifying Party.

  

### 

  

### (d) Buyer shall not be deemed to have notice of any claim or breach by
Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this
Agreement by virtue of knowledge acquired on or prior to the Closing Date by
an employee of Company.

  

### 

  

## **13.4** ** Remedies Exclusive.** If the Closing occurs, the remedies
provided for in this Article 13 shall be the exclusive remedies available to
a party arising out of an alleged breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that
any indemnification matters relating to Taxes, including any
indemnification matters relating to any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Section 5.19 (Tax Matters), shall instead be governed
exclusively by Section 11.3 and by such specific portions of this Article 13
as are incorporated by Section 11.3(l). Neither party will be liable for
special, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary or similar damages
arising from a breach of this Agreement, except to the extent, and subject to
the limitations on indemnification set forth in this Article 13, such
party actually paid to a third party any such damages in respect of a matter
for which such party is entitled to indemnification under Section 13.2(a)
or 13.2(d), as the case may be.

  

## 

  

## **13.5** ** Recoveries.** If an Indemnified Party subsequently
receives payment (including proceeds of insurance, third party
indemnification, payments on accounts receivable and Tax Benefits) with
respect to a matter for which it has been fully indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the amount of
such payment, up to the indemnification received, to the Indemnifying Party.
Such Indemnified Party shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek any such payments to which it may be entitled.

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

## **13.6** ** Characterization.** Any amounts paid by an Indemnifying Party
to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 13 or Section 11.3 shall be
treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  

## 

  

# **ARTICLE 14 
 MISCELLANEOUS**

  

# 

  

## **14.1** ** Expenses.** Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the negotiation,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## **14.2** ** Binding Effect.** This Agreement shall become binding and
effective when executed by Buyer and by Seller. This Agreement shall not be
assignable by either Buyer or Seller without the prior written consent of the
other, except that without relieving a party of any of its obligations under
this Agreement, either party may assign this Agreement to any of its wholly-
owned subsidiaries. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns of the parties
hereto. This Agreement constitutes an agreement among the parties hereto and
none of the agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained
herein shall be for the benefit of, or create any third party beneficiary
rights in, any Person not a party to this Agreement (other than the Seller
Parties and the Buyer Parties to the extent expressly provided in Article
13).

  

## 

  

## **14.3** ** Entire Agreement; Amendments.** This Agreement (including
the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to their subject
matter. The making, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties
have not been induced by any representations, warranties, statements or
agreements other than those expressed in this Agreement. This Agreement

respect to the subject matter hereof except for the Confidentiality
Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument duly
executed by the parties.

## **14.6** ** Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to conflicts of laws principles.

  

## 

  

## **14.7** ** Jurisdiction.** Each party irrevocably submits to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware in connection with
any legal proceeding arising out of or relating hereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect
of such legal proceeding shall be heard and determined in such state or
federal court. Each party irrevocably waives (and agrees not to plead or
claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any legal proceeding arising
out of or relating hereto or the transactions contemplated thereby in the
courts of Delaware and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each party further agrees, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that a final and non-appealable judgment
against it in any legal proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment. Each party agrees that
service of process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such persons respective notice address determined in accordance with Section
14.4 herein shall be effective service of process for any legal proceeding
with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction
pursuant to this Section 14.7.

  

## 

  

## **14.8** ** Waivers.** Any provision of this Agreement may be waived only
by a written instrument executed by the party to be charged with such waiver.
The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.  Any
condition to a partys obligations under this Agreement may be waived only in
writing by such party.
