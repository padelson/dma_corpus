If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its right to dissent, such holders shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration, without any interest, in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_.

 (b) _Exchange Fund_. Upon the Effective Time and from time to time thereafter, the Purchaser shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash in amounts necessary to pay the Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") due upon the surrender of the Company Certificates.

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of the Company Certificates whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.6 _into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Purchaser shall reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange payment in the amount of the Merger Consideration (less any required Tax withholding) that the holder is entitled to receive under  _Section 2.6_, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to any Merger Consideration deliverable upon due surrender of the Company Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a transferee if, and only if, the Company Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8_, each Company Certificate (other than the Company Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Company Certificate pursuant to this _Article II_. In the case of the Company Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, each Company Certificate representing Dissenting Shares shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the CGCL. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_. The payment of the Merger Consideration upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and made in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company

Shares) following the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the

the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, the Company Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.8_, subject to
applicable Legal Requirements in the case of the Company Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
the Company Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of
the Company, except as provided by Legal Requirements. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then payment shall be made in accordance with this _Section 2.8_ in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the delivery to the Exchange Agent of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and an indemnity in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser (and, if required by the Purchaser, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Purchaser may direct, to support such indemnity) against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent or the Purchaser or otherwise with respect to such Company Certificate. 

  

 (f) _Transferred Certificates_. If any payment under this _Section 2.8_ is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or such Person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ that remains undistributed to holders of the Company Certificates for one (1) year after the Effective Time, together with all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent with respect thereto, shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to the Purchaser and any holders of the Company Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter only look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal Requirements), only as general creditors thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Company Certificates held by them. 

  

 (h) _No Liability_. Neither the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any former holder of shares of the Company Common Stock for any stock or cash held by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for payment pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made by the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 

  

 Section 2.9 _Stock Options._  

  

 As of the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding and unexercised stock option (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") under the Company Option Plans, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be entitled to receive from the Company, an amount in cash (net of any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether then exercisable) and (B) the excess of the Merger Consideration per share over the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether then exercisable) (such amount, the " _Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration per share shall be canceled in full without any payment in respect thereof; and  _provided, further,_ that at and after the Effective Time (and subject to the rights of holders to receive the payment contemplated by this _Section 2.9_), all Company Stock Options shall be canceled in full (and the Company shall take any and all necessary action to cause such cancellation to occur at such time), and no Company Stock Options shall be exercisable, whether for shares of Company Common Stock, shares of the Purchaser common stock or otherwise.

 (d) If, at any time after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any event should occur that results in the Proxy Statement containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or that otherwise should be described in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company and the Purchaser shall promptly notify each other of the occurrence of such event and then promptly prepare, file and clear with the SEC such amendment or supplement and the Company shall, as may be required by the SEC, mail to its shareholders each such amendment or supplement. 

  

 (e) The Company shall promptly (i) notify the Purchaser and Merger Sub following receipt of any written communication from, or non-written communication with, the U.S. Department of Justice or the SEC or any other Governmental Authority or their respective staffs that relates to the FCPA or any other similar Legal Requirement, and (ii) provide the Purchaser with copies of all related written communication, and a reasonably detailed explanation of all non-written communication. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith in connection therewith, and in responding to and otherwise interacting with such Governmental Authorities. The Company shall provide, to the extent practicable, the Purchaser and its advisors with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed communication (written or oral) to or with any such Governmental Authority, and shall make all changes to such communications as reasonably may be requested by the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide the Purchaser with any communication or other information to the extent expressly prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 Section 5.3 _Access to Information._  

  

 Throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Purchaser and its officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives prompt, reasonable access during normal business hours to all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as may be reasonably requested in 

   ##### 

  

    

connection with the consummation of the Merger, and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish as
promptly as practicable to the Purchaser such information concerning the
Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses, properties, financial condition,
operations and personnel as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably
request;  _provided_ that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Any such investigation
by the Purchaser shall not affect the representations or warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement. The Purchaser shall hold any
information provided under this _Section 5.3_ in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.4 _Company Shareholders  Meeting._ 

  

 The Company shall establish a record date for and cause a meeting of its shareholders to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval (such meeting, the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_"). In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company, acting through its board of directors, will, subject to _Section 5.5(c)_, (i) recommend the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) otherwise comply with all Legal Requirements applicable to such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the termination rights of the Parties, the Companys obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall not be affected by the commencement, proposal, disclosure or communication to the Company or otherwise of any Acquisition Proposal (including a Superior Proposal). 

  

 Section 5.5 _No Solicitation._  

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents, advisors or representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) solicit, initiate, participate in, or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (ii) disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their businesses, assets, liabilities or prospects or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal; or 

   

 (iii) waive or modify any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement with any third party; 

 

 _provided_ that, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, the
Company may negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, and furnish
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
their businesses, assets, liabilities or prospects or afford access to the
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any
Person (a " _Third Party_ ") who delivers an unsolicited written _bona fide_
proposal or offer 

  ##### 

  

   

regarding an Acquisition Proposal if the board of directors of the Company has
(i) determined in good faith (after consulting with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that such proposal or offer constitutes or
reasonably could be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; (ii) provided
written notice to the Purchaser of its intent to furnish information or enter
into discussions with such Third Party prior to taking any such action and
(iii) obtained from such Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement
and standstill agreement on terms no less restrictive with respect to such
Third Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement and standstill agreement and
any related agreements shall not include any provision calling for any
exclusive right to negotiate with such Third Party or otherwise having the
effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this
Agreement in full or in part), except that such confidentiality agreement may
permit such Third Party to share confidential information with its financing
sources and Representatives, _provided_ that the Company shall cause the
Third Party to agree that such financing sources and Representatives shall
also keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party (i) for more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the Company or fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) which a majority of the entire board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, who may be the Companys regularly engaged outside legal counsel), taking into account the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and the likelihood and timing of consummation (including the financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal deemed relevant by the board of directors of the Company in good faith), would result in a transaction that is superior from a financial point of view to the Companys shareholders to the Merger, including any proposed alterations of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Purchaser in response to such proposal and (iii) that is not subject to any material contingency, including any contingency related to financing, unless, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of the Company, such contingency is reasonably capable of being satisfied by such Third Party within a reasonable period of time. 

  

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify the Purchaser and Merger Sub (orally and in writing) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than one (1) Business Day) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any proposal or offer for, any Acquisition Proposal, including any amendments or proposed amendments thereto. Such notice shall identify the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party making or considering making such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (c) Neither the Companys board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Purchaser or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or any similar recommendation of any committee of the Companys board of directors (any of the foregoing actions being a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or agree to approve 

   ##### 

  

    

or recommend or take a position with respect to, or cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar arrangement
with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (except for a
confidentiality agreement and standstill agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal to the extent permitted under _Section 5.5(a)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith before the Company Shareholders Approval is obtained
and after consulting with outside legal counsel (who may be the Companys
regularly engaged outside legal counsel) and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation that the failure to announce a Change in the
Company Recommendation is likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Companys board of directors under applicable Legal Requirements, then
the Companys board of directors may make a Change in the Company
Recommendation; and (B) if after considering an Acquisition Proposal, the
Companys board of directors determines that the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may enter into a
definitive agreement to implement such Superior Proposal (in the form
previously provided to the Purchaser as provided below), but only (1) after
providing written notice to the Purchaser (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_
") advising the Purchaser that the Companys board of directors has received
a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, identifying the Third Party making such Superior Proposal
and indicating that the Companys board of directors intends to effect a
Change in the Company Recommendation, accompanied by a copy of the definitive
agreement proposed to be entered into with such Third Party, (2) if the
Purchaser does not, within three (3) Business Days after the Purchasers
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer that is at least as
favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view
(as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the Company) as
such Superior Proposal and (3) if simultaneously with executing such
definitive agreement the Company (x) terminates this Agreement and (y) pays
the Termination Fee to the Purchaser. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.5_ shall prevent the Company from taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party to the extent required by Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making such disclosure to the Company shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys board of directors (after consulting with its outside legal counsel, who may be the Companys regularly engaged outside legal counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , that in connection therewith neither the Company nor the Companys board of directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as specifically permitted herein, make a Change in the Company Recommendation. 

  

 Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Consents._  

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of any necessary consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Authority and/or any other public or private third party that is required to be obtained by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries in 

   ##### 

  

    

connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the making or obtaining of all necessary filings and
registrations with respect thereto, including filings under the HSR Act, the
German Regulation (if required) or any other similar laws, (ii) the defending
of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings before any Governmental Authority
seeking to enjoin, restrain or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The Company and
the Purchaser each use their respective reasonable best efforts to comply as
promptly as practicable with any other laws of any Governmental Authority
that are applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
pursuant to which any consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or
any other person in connection with such transactions is necessary. The
Company and the Purchaser each shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with their preparation of any filing, registration or declaration that
is necessary under the HSR Act, the German Regulation (if required) or any
other such laws. The Company and the Purchaser shall keep each other apprised
of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filing, registration or declaration, and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to comply promptly with any such inquiry or request
(and, unless precluded by applicable Legal Requirements, provide copies of
any such communications that are in writing). Neither Party shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party
prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate in such meeting. The
Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Purchaser nor Merger Sub
will be required by this _Section 5.6_ to (i) take any action, including
entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other
arrangements, that (x) requires the divestiture of any assets of any of the
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (y)
limits the Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, the Company and its Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of
the Purchasers or its Affiliates other assets or businesses or (z) requires
or comprises any other material financial or other concession or (ii) waive
any condition to closing contained in  _Article VII_.

 (a) Until December 31, 2007, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall require the Surviving Corporation to provide, U.S. and U.K. employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, subject to subsection (b) of this _Section 5.7_, nothing herein shall be construed to mean that the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation cannot amend or terminate any particular Benefit Plan, Foreign Plan or any other employee benefit, compensation or incentive plan, policy or arrangement so long as the requirements of this  _Section 5.7_ and applicable Legal Requirements are otherwise satisfied. Nothing in this subsection (a) shall be construed to cancel or impair existing contractual

obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries to any employee in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a) of this _Section 5.7_, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain the Diagnostic Products Corporation Retirement Plan until December 31, 2007, and shall provide employees of the Surviving Corporation with levels of matching contributions, fixed contributions, and variable contributions under such plan that are no less, when expressed as a percentage of a participants compensation, than the levels of each of such type of contributions made by the Company to its employees under such plan for the plan year ending on December 31, 2005. 

  

 (c) With respect to any employee benefit plans of the Purchaser in which the employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries participate subsequent to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions applicable to such employees to the same extent such exclusions would have been waived or would otherwise not be excluded under the Benefit Plans or Foreign Plans in which such employees were participating immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) credit all deductibles and co-pays paid under any of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries health plans toward deductibles and co-pays under the health plans of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries and (iii) recognize all service of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under any employee benefit plan, severance policy, vacation, sick, holiday or other paid leave policy, and for purposes of benefit accrual under any severance policy, vacation, sick, holiday or other paid leave policy, of the Surviving Corporation or the Purchaser in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the same extent taken into account under the corresponding plan or policy in which such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any terms of the applicable vacation policy of the Purchaser to the contrary, each of the employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to at least that number of days of vacation per year as they had become entitled to under the terms of the applicable vacation policy of the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Person any right to continued employment with the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment or services of any Person at any time following the Effective Time, with or without cause. Except as set forth in  _Section 5.9_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any Employee (or any of their respective beneficiaries) any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Control of Other Party s Business._ 

  

 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Purchaser or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time.

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for a period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time coverage under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies as in effect on the date hereof for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_"); _provided_ that (A) the Purchaser may substitute therefor policies with a reputable insurer of comparable credit quality of substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous individually or in the aggregate to the Indemnified Parties, (B) if the existing DandO Insurance expires or is canceled during such period, the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance from a reputable insurer of comparable credit quality, (C) in no event shall the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than 250% of the last annual premiums paid by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (which the Company represents and warrants to be the amount set forth in _Section 5.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_) (the " _Maximum Premium Amount_ ") to maintain or procure DandO Insurance pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ and (D) if the annual premiums of such DandO Insurance would exceed the Maximum Premium Amount, the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the Purchaser may, or may cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase six-(6) year tail coverage covering acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time on terms not materially less favorable to any director, officer or employee to the existing policy of the Company as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties. The rights of each 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of,
any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under any other
indemnification arrangement. 

  

 (d) If the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations in this _Section 5.9_.

 Section 5.11 _Notice Obligations._  

  

 Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and the Purchaser shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it (in the case of the Company) or a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder (in the case of the Purchaser), (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , _VII_ or _VIII_ , as applicable, to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to comply with this _Section 5.11_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ or _VIII_ , as applicable, to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_ or _VIII_ , as applicable, to be satisfied.

 (ii) after the date of this Agreement, if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, judgment, injunction or other order, in any case that is in effect, final and non-appealable and that prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger (a " _Legal Prohibition_ "); or

 (i) at any time after a Change in the Company Recommendation or if the board of directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) shall have (x) approved or recommended or announced a neutral position with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (y) failed to reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger within five (5) Business Days of being requested by the Purchaser to do so, or (z) resolved to do any of the foregoing; 

   

 (ii) (A) if any of the Companys representations and warranties shall have been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in 

   ##### 

  

   

 _Section 7.3_ would not be satisfied, or (B) if any of the
Companys representations and warranties become inaccurate as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent
date), such that the condition set forth in  _Section 7.3_ would not be
satisfied, or (C) if any of the Companys covenants contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached, such that the condition set forth in 
_Section 7.2_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ that no such inaccuracy or
breach under the foregoing clauses shall give rise to a right to terminate,
unless such inaccuracy or breach cannot be or is not cured within thirty (30)
days of notice of such inaccuracy or breach from the Purchaser (or, if
sooner, the date prior to the End Date); 

   

 (d) by the Company upon written notice to the Purchaser: 

   

 (i) in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of _Section 5.5(c)_ ; _provided_ that such termination under this clause (d)(i) shall not be effective until the Company has tendered payment of the fee required pursuant to _Section 9.3(d)_ ; or 

   

 (ii) (A) if any of the Purchasers or Merger Subs representations and warranties shall have been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in  _Section 8.2_ would not be satisfied, or (B) if any of the Purchasers and Merger Subs representations and warranties become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in  _Section 8.2_ would not be satisfied, or (C) if any of the Purchasers and Merger Subs covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached, such that the condition set forth in _Section 8.1_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ that no such inaccuracy or breach under the foregoing clauses shall give rise to a right to terminate, unless such inaccuracy or breach cannot be or is not cured within thirty (30) days of notice of such inaccuracy or breach from the Company (or, if sooner, the date prior to the End Date). 

  

 Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination._  

  

 If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without liability of any Party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such Party) to the other Parties hereto, except that (i) the agreements contained in _Sections 9.2_ and _9.3_ and _Article X_ of this Agreement and in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination hereof and (ii) no such termination shall relieve any Party of any liability for damages resulting from any willful breach by such Party of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.3 _Fees and Expenses._  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.3_, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost or expense whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) Under the circumstances and at the times specified in this _Section 9.3_, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser a termination fee of $44,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Fee_ "). The amount of the Termination Fee may, in certain circumstances, be
reduced as provided in _Section 9.3(g)_. 

  

 (c) If (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ [End Date], _ 9.1(b)(iii)_ [No Vote], _9.1(c)(i)_ after a Change in Recommendation, or  _9.1(c)(ii)(C)_ [Company Breach] by reason of a breach of _Sections 5.2(a)_ or _ (b)_ , _5.4_ or _5.5_ , (B) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is made by any Third Party and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, either (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar arrangement with any Third Party with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal or (2) if neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement or other arrangement contemplated in clause (C)(1) and any Third Party commences a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in the acquisition by such Third Party, or any affiliate thereof, making the tender or exchange offer of fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company Common Stock, then in either case the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to the Purchaser at the times provided in _Section 9.3(e)_. The Parties agree that if a Termination Fee is paid by the Company to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.3(c)_, then such Termination Fee (together with any expense reimbursement paid pursuant to _Section 9.3(g)_ ) shall be the Purchasers and Merger Subs exclusive remedy for the matters covered by this _Section 9.3(c)_. 

  

 (d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ [Superior Proposal], then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to the Purchaser simultaneously with such termination as provided in _Section 9.1(d)(i)_. 

  

 (e) If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee (i) within one (1) Business Day after the consummation of the transaction pursuant to the agreement or other arrangement, as the case may be and as contemplated by _Section 9.3(c)(C)(1)_, or (ii) within one (1) Business Day after the closing of the tender or exchange offer contemplated by _Section 9.3(c)(C)(2)_. 

  

 (f) Any payment of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Purchaser. 

  

 (g) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ [No Vote],  _9.1(c)(i)_ after a Change in Recommendation, or _9.1(c)(ii)(C)_ [Company Breach] by reason of a breach of _Sections 5.2(a) or (b), 5.4 or 5.5_, and if, prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is made by any Third Party, then the Company shall, promptly after receipt from the Purchaser of a reasonably-detailed invoice therefor, reimburse the Purchaser for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, auditors, investment bankers, experts and other advisors) incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Shareholder Agreement and all of the respective transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, up to a maximum aggregate amount not to exceed $7,000,000. Any Termination Fee paid after a payment pursuant to this paragraph (g) shall be reduced by the amount of the payment made pursuant to this paragraph (g). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement.

 Section 10.4 _Headings; Certain Construction Rules._  

  

 The Article, Section and paragraph headings and the table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and do not form a part of this Agreement and do not in any way modify, interpret or construe the intentions of the Parties.

All terms defined in this Agreement have their defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined therein. If any action is to be taken by any Party hereto pursuant to this Agreement on a day that is not a Business Day, such action shall be taken on the next Business Day following such day.
