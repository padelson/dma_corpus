the Company hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including
_Article VII_ ), as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, but in any event no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after
the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act,
the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Common Stock validly
tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the conditions set forth in
Annex I (as they may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer Conditions_ ").

 

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, Parent and Merger Sub reserve the right,
at any time, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Condition), to increase the Offer Price or to modify the terms of
the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition or
Termination Condition, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer that are different
than or in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) modify or amend any existing
Offer Condition in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Common Stock
(other than in an immaterial respect) or that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or impair the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, (vi) except as otherwise required or
expressly permitted by _Section 1.1(d)_, extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Time, (vii) provide for any "subsequent offering period" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (viii) otherwise amend,
modify or supplement the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Common
Stock or in any manner that delays or unreasonably interferes with, hinders or
impairs the consummation of the Offer. Subject to _Section 1.1(g)_, the
Offer may not be terminated prior to its scheduled Expiration Time, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_.

 

(c) The Offer shall initially expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date that is twenty-one (21) Business Days (calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the
Offer (such initial expiration date and time of the Offer, the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 1.1(d)_, the date and time to which the Offer has

required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts
are so deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person

promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
such holders of Common Stock in the amount of any such losses to the extent
necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under  _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ and _Section 2.2_.

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to
Parent upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has not complied with this _Article II_ shall look only to the

clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

case of clauses _(ii)_ and  _(iii)_ , where such violation, breach,

copies of a fully executed commitment letter and fee letter (other than any
customary information to be redacted from the fee letter with respect to fees
and market "flex" provisions pursuant to the terms thereof, which redacted
information shall not include any information that would adversely affect the
aggregate amount, conditionality, or termination of the financing contemplated
therein) dated on or about the date of this Agreement from the financial
institutions identified therein (together with all exhibits, annexes,
schedules and term sheets attached thereto and as amended, modified,
supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.10_, collectively, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), providing, subject to the terms and conditions therein,
for debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and to
the knowledge of Parent, none of the respective obligations and commitments
contained in such letters have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect nor is any such withdrawal, termination or rescission contemplated.
Assuming (a) the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter and (b) the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, the net
proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (after netting out
applicable Expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges
and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original
issue discount flex) will, together with Parents cash and the Minimum Cash
Balance, in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate Offer Price and Merger Consideration (and
any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or the
Debt Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts
payable in respect of Company Equity Awards under this Agreement) and to pay
all related Expenses payable on the Closing Date by them in connection with
the Transactions (such amount collectively, the " _Required_

 



34 ##### Table of Contents

  

  _Amount_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter
is (i) a legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, (ii) enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms against Guarantor, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto and (iii) in full force
and effect, in each case subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach on the part of Guarantor or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
parties thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter. All commitment fees and
other fees required to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement have
been paid. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents
and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that the conditions precedent set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that the Required Amount
will not be available on the Closing Date. The only conditions precedent
related to the lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no side letters
or other Contracts or arrangements (except for a customary fee letter, fee
credit letter and engagement letter that do not affect the conditionality or
amount of the Debt Financing) to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a
party related to the Debt Financing other than as expressly contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement that would (A) impair the enforceability of the Debt Commitment
Letter, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount as compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement) such that
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing would be below the amount required
to pay the Required Amount, (C) impose new or additional conditions precedent
to the Debt Financing, (D) otherwise adversely modify any of the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing or (E)  reasonably be expected to prevent,
impair or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing.

privilege with respect thereto) or (B) contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this

direct or indirect solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Persons

discussions or negotiations that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Takeover Proposal) that existed on or prior to the date hereof and (ii) from
and after the date hereof until the Offer Acceptance Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , not, directly
or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly or overtly encourage or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any Persons to whom the
Company has made such a request prior to the date hereof to the extent such

Company may not waive or release any preexisting explicit or
implicit standstill provisions or similar agreements with any Person or group
of Persons that has the effect of prohibiting the counterparty thereto from

provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time from and after

or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide and written

expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company and any of its
Representatives may (x) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal and furnish
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to

their respective Representatives; _provided_ , that the Company shall

notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3_, neither the Company Board nor

a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify, amend
or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation,
(B) recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly
propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (D) fail to
recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,
against any Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act
within five (5) Business Days after commencement of such Takeover Proposal or
(E) following the date of receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any material

written request to do so (any action described in this clause _(i)_ being
referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any Subsidiary to enter into, any Contract, letter of intent or
memorandum of understanding or other similar agreement constituting, or that
would reasonably be expected to result in, any Takeover Proposal, other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  _Section 5.3(d)_,
in response to a written Takeover Proposal received by the Company Board after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section
5.3_ and that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section 7.4(a)_, or authorize, resolve, agree or propose
publicly to take any such action, only if all of the following conditions are
met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a

the Person or group making the Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and all other documents related to the Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice and a new five (5) Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause
(ii) below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.4(a)_ in order to enter into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to making such an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.4(a)_, as applicable, to the extent requested by Parent, engaged
in good faith negotiations with Parent, and cause its Representatives to
engage in good faith negotiations with Parents Representatives, during such
notice period to amend this Agreement or the Offer in such a manner that the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have no obligation to engage in such
negotiations or amend any of the terms of this Agreement or the Offer; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to
so terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.4(a)_, as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.3(d)_,
upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any
time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation

action, only if all of the following conditions are met:

prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the reasons for the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii)
below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation

 Change and (B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change, to the
extent requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations, and cause its
Representatives to engage in good faith negotiations with Parents
Representatives, with Parent during such five (5) Business Day period to amend
this Agreement or the Offer in such a manner that the failure of the Company
Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening
Event in accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that Parent shall have no
obligation to engage in such negotiations or amend any of the terms of this
Agreement or the Offer; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening
Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the

1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act;

Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent
otherwise permitted by this  _Section 5.3_.

Section 8.8 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects by written
agreement of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after Merger

_Section 8.5(b)_, _Section 8.6_, this _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.11_,

 Agreement or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part
of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement.

 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (and the Exhibits and Annexes
hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement
(collectively, the " _Related Documents_ ") contain all of the terms,
conditions and representations and warranties agreed to by the parties
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, correspondence, communications,
undertakings, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement.

Section 8.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) as to the Lender
Related Parties, for the provisions of _Section 7.5_, _Section 7.6_,
_Section 8.5(b)_, _Section 8.6_, _Section 8.8_, this _Section 8.11_,
_Section 8.15_ and _Section 8.16_, (b) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs,
the right of the Companys stockholders that validly tendered their shares of
Common Stock in the Offer to receive the Offer Price in respect of such
shares, (c) the rights of the beneficiaries of the rights provided in
_Section 5.5_ to the extent provided therein, (d) if the Effective Time

Merger Consideration to which they are entitled to receive in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_ and for the rights of the holders of Company Equity Awards
to receive such amounts and/or awards as provided for in _Section 2.3_
and (e) the rights of the Non-Party Affiliates set forth in _Section 8.16_,
the parties hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein.

Section 8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of that
provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, then
(a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision
in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and
purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of that provision, or the application of that provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

 

Section 8.13 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to _Article III_ and _Article IV_ , each party to this Agreement has
or may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a
section of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an
admission by such party that such item is material, that such item would,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material

 



72 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure of such be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. The phrases "delivered," "made available," "provided to,"
"furnished to," and phrases of similar import when used herein, unless the
context otherwise requires, shall mean that a true, correct and complete paper
copy of the information or material referred to has been provided to the
party to whom such information or material is to be provided, have been
deposited by the Company or Parent in the electronic datarooms maintained for
the Transactions by the Company or publicly filed by the Company with the
SEC, in each case on or before 7:30pm Pacific time on the date of this
Agreement. Where a reference is made to a Contract, instrument or Law, such
reference is to such Contract, instrument or Law as amended, modified
or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by
waiver or consent and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable
successor Law and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein;  _provided_ , that any amendment, modification, waiver
or consent to a Contract not disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter, or
provided to Parent on or before 7:30pm Pacific time on the date of this
Agreement shall be disregarded unless such amendment, modification, waiver or
consent was permitted hereunder. Unless the context of this Agreement
otherwise requires: (a) words of any gender include each other gender, (b)
words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number, respectively, (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (d) references to
clauses without a cross-reference to a Section or subsection are references
to clauses within the same Section or, if more specific, subsection, and (e)
references to any Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that
Person. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if." All references to "days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise
indicated as a "Business Day."

Section 8.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
Law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or Liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, prior to the Effective
Time, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary to be a party to the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in
which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary (except with respect to representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and
all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement shall also be made with respect to such
other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation. Any purported assignment
without such prior written consents shall be null and void.

 Section 8.15 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies (including those as set forth in _Section 7.6_) would
not be an adequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section 8.15(b)_, the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or
in equity (including monetary damages), and the parties to this Agreement
hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral
in connection therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that or otherwise assert that (i) the other party has an adequate
remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



73 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.15(a)_, the right
of the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to fund the Offer
Price and the Merger Consideration and Parents and Merger Subs obligations
to cause the Offer Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the Closing (but
not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the
requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii) with respect to
the consummation of the Offer (including the payment of the Offer Price), all
Offer Conditions were satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time) or validly
waived in accordance with the terms hereof at the Expiration Time, (iii) with
respect to the consummation of the Merger (including the payment of the
Merger Consideration) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ were
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Effective Time, but subject to such conditions being able to be
satisfied at the Effective Time) or validly waived in accordance with the
terms hereof at the Effective Time, (iv) the Debt Financing (or Alternative
Financing) has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing, (v) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) is
funded, the Closing will occur substantially simultaneously with the drawdown
of the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) and the Company has not
revoked, withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation and (B) the
Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the Closing and the
Transactions and (vi) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing
within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the Companys irrevocable
written confirmation. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_, the
Company shall not be entitled to specific performance under this _Section
8.15_ and the Parent Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole and
exclusive remedy, as provided by _Section 7.6(d)_.

Section 8.16  _Non-Recourse_. All Legal Actions (whether in Contract or in
tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement or the Related Documents or the negotiation, execution,
performance or non-performance of this Agreement or the Related Documents
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement, the Related Documents or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the Related Documents) may be made by any party hereto only
against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto or
thereto. In no event shall any named party to this Agreement or the Related
Documents have any shared or vicarious Liability for the actions or omissions
of any other Person other than as provided in _Section 8.17_. No Person who
is not a named party to this Agreement or the Related Documents, including any
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or Representative of any named party to this
Agreement that is not itself a named party to this Agreement or any of the
Related Documents, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Lender Related
Party (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any Liability (whether in
Contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose Liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) to
any party to this Agreement for any Liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include those Liabilities arising under the Debt Financing that may be
asserted by the parties thereto), the Related Documents or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement, the Related Documents
or their negotiation or execution; and each party hereto or thereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Party Affiliates. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Non-Party
Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.16_.
Nothing in this _Section 8.16_ shall in any way expand the circumstances
in which Parent may be liable under this Agreement or as a result of the
Transactions (including as a result of the Debt Financing).

Annex I

 

Offer Conditions

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Merger Subs right to extend and amend
the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act, Merger Sub shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment or pay for any shares of
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
if any of the following conditions exist or have occurred and are continuing
at the scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer:

(a) _Minimum Condition_. The number of shares of Common Stock validly tendered
(and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the Offer (but
excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been "received", as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL),
together with the shares of Common Stock then owned by Merger Sub, do not
represent at least one share more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of
Common Stock (the " _Minimum Condition_ ").

 

(b) _Legal Restraints_. Either (i) an Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) shall have been issued by a Governmental Authority and remain in
effect that would (i) make any of the Company Stockholder Agreements, the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions illegal or (ii) otherwise
prevent the consummation thereof or (b) an applicable Law shall be in effect
that would make the acquisition of or payment for Shares pursuant to the
Offer, or the consummation of the Merger, illegal or violative of any Law.

 

(c) _Governmental Consents_. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act
shall not have expired or been terminated and the Telecom Approvals shall not
have been obtained.

(d)  _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Company (i) set forth in, _Section 3.8(a)_ and Section 3.8(d) ( _Absence
of Certain Changes or Events_ ) of the Agreement shall not be true
and correct in all respects as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as
though made as of the Expiration Time, (ii) set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_,
_Section 3.2(b)_ and the last sentence of _Section 3.2(d)_ (
_Capitalization_ ) of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all
respects (except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies, it being understood that
inaccuracies shall be deemed to be " _de minimis_ " if and only if
the Companys fully diluted capitalization as of the Capitalization Date does
not exceed the Companys fully diluted capitalization set forth in _Section
3.2(a)_ and _Section 3.2(b)_ by more than 0.075% in the aggregate) as of the
Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such earlier date), (iii) set forth in _Section 3.1_ (
_Corporate Existence_ ), the second sentence of Section 3.2(c) and Section
3.2(e) ( _Capitalization_ ), _Section 3.3_ ( _Corporate Authority_ ;
_Enforceability_ ), _Section 3.5(f)(ii)_ ( _Compliance with Laws; Permits_ ),
_Section 3.17(a)_ ( _Finders_ ; _Brokers_ ) and _Section 3.19_ ( _Opinion of
Financial Advisors_ ) of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all
material respects (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to
"materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import
set forth therein) as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though
made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) and (iv) set forth in the
Agreement, other than those Sections specifically identified in clauses _(i)_
, _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this paragraph _(d)_ , shall not be true and
correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality",
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth
therein) as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of
the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this
clause _(iv)_ , where the failure to be true and correct would not have or
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall
not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an
executive officer of the Company to such effect.

 



Annex I-1 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) _Compliance with Covenants_. The Company shall not have complied with or
performed in all material respects its obligations, agreements and covenants
required to be complied with or performed by it prior to the Expiration Time
under the Agreement and such failure to comply or perform shall not have been
cured by the Expiration Time. Parent shall not have received a certificate
signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such
effect.

(f)  _Company Material Adverse Effect Condition_. Since the date of the
Agreement there shall have been any Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent
shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an
executive officer of the Company to such effect.

(g) _No Termination of Agreement_. The Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

(h) _Marketing Period_. The Marketing Period shall not have been completed.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition, may be
waived by Parent and Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time in their respective sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of
Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed
a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to
particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect
to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ shall have the meanings set
forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed unless specifically defined in
this _Annex I_.

For purposes of the Agreement, when reference is made to one or more Offer
Conditions being "satisfied" (or words of similar import), it shall mean that
such condition described therein does not exist.
