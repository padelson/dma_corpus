sole member that Parent acquire the Company through the statutory merger of
Sub I with and into the Company, pursuant to which the Company would become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "First Merger"), and as part of the
same overall transaction, the surviving entity of the First Merger would merge
with and into Sub II (the "Second Merger," and together with the First Merger,
the "Mergers") upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in
accordance with Delaware Law (as defined below), and in furtherance thereof,
have approved this Agreement and the First Merger.

B. It is intended that the Mergers are integrated steps in the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and will together qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

C. Pursuant to the First Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined below) (i)
all of the issued and outstanding Company Capital Stock (as defined below)
shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set forth
herein, (ii) certain of the issued and outstanding Company Options shall be
cancelled and (iii) certain of the issued and outstanding Company Options will
be assumed by Parent.

D. A portion of the consideration otherwise payable by Parent in connection
with the First Merger shall be placed into escrow by Parent as described
herein as security for the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Agreement.

E. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger Subs, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Mergers.

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and the Merger Subs to enter into this

Closing, pursuant to such Key Employee's execution and delivery of Parent's or
such subsidiary's standard form of (i) employment offer letter and (ii)

H. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and the Merger Subs to enter into this
Agreement, the Key Stockholders, shall have entered into and delivered to

form attached hereto as Exhibit C, to be effective upon the Closing.

I Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the

Corporation." At the Second Effective Time (as defined below), Parent shall
cause the First-Step Surviving Corporation to merge with and into Sub II in
accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate corporate existence of

hereto and following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article V hereof, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,
Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304,
unless another time or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and
the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs shall be referred
to herein as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall
cause the First Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-1 (the "Certificate of Merger"), with

of paragraphs (A) and (B) below, only to the extent such Key Stockholders are
not also Unaccredited Investors):

(A) with respect to each Mixed Election Share, (1) the Closing Per Share Mixed
Election Amount, subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 6.5(c)
hereof, plus (2) any applicable Additional Per Share Amount;

(B) with respect to each Stock Election Share, (1) the Closing Per Share Stock
Election Amount, subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 6.5(c)
hereof plus (2) any applicable Additional Per Share Amount; and

(C) with respect to each Cash Election Share, (1) the Closing Per Share Cash
Election Amount, subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 6.5(c)

(b) Treatment of Company Options.

(i) Effect on Company Options.

(A) Company Options Held by Continuing Employees. At the Effective Time,
pursuant to this Agreement, each Company Option held by a Continuing Employee
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each an "Assumed Option" and together, the "Assumed Options")
shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
be assumed by Parent. Except as provided herein, each Assumed Option shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the 2012 Plan and the option agreements relating thereto (including with
respect to the vesting thereof), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (A) each Assumed Option will be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Assumed Option (without regard to vesting conditions) immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement on





-17- 



Form S‑8 (or any successor or other appropriate form that Parent is eligible
to use) under the Securities Act with respect to the total number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Options (without
regard to vesting conditions), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such registration statement to remain in effect for so long as the
Assumed Options remain outstanding.

(B) Company Options Held by Persons other than Continuing Employees or
Voluntary Termination Employees. At the Effective Time, each Company Option
that is held by a Terminating Employee or any other Person that is not a
Continuing Employee or a Voluntary Termination Employee and that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a
"Cancelled Option" and together, the "Cancelled Options") shall not be assumed
and will, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Subs, Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and
converted without exercise into and, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement and, except in the case of the Terminating Employees,
in a Confirmatory Document entered into by and between the Company and the
holder of such Cancelled Option, represent the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the sum of the Per Share Cash Election Amount
less the applicable exercise price of such Cancelled Option.

(C) Company Options Held by Voluntary Termination Employees. At the Effective
Time, each Unvested Company Option held by a Voluntary Termination Employee
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall not be assumed and will, by virtue of the First Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, Company or
the holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration. At the Effective Time,
each Vested Company Option held by a Voluntary Termination Employee and that
is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each a "Voluntary Termination Option" and together, the "Voluntary
Termination Options") shall not be assumed and will, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs,
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted without exercise
into and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and,
if applicable, in a Confirmatory Document entered into by and between the
Company and the holder of such Voluntary Termination Option, represent the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the sum of the
Per Share Cash Election Amount less the applicable exercise price of such
Voluntary Termination Option.

(D) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the reasonable review and
approval of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
effect the provisions set forth in this Section 1.7(b) with respect to all
Company Options, including any necessary amendments to any Company Options and
the delivery of all required notices required to be delivered pursuant to such
Company Options or the Plans in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the First Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Any materials to be submitted to the holders of Company Options in
connection with any notice or amendment required under this Section 1.7(b)
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) Maximum Cash Consideration. The amount of cash distributed as part of the
Total Consideration shall not exceed 45.0% of the Total Consideration (the
"Maximum Cash Consideration"). To the extent the Merger Consideration Election
Forms returned by Company Stockholders in the aggregate represent elections to
receive an amount in cash in excess of the Maximum Cash Consideration less the
aggregate amount of cash payable to Unaccredited Stockholders pursuant to
Section 1.7(a)(ii) and to Company Optionholders pursuant to Sections
1.7(b)(i)(B) and 1.7(b)(i)(C) (the "Maximum Cash Threshold Amount"), such
Company Stockholders shall only have the right to receive cash as follows:





-18- 



(i) Each Company Stockholder (other than the Unaccredited Stockholders) making
an election to receive the Cash Election Shares or the Series B Cash Election
Shares, as applicable, shall have the right to receive an amount of cash
consideration equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) such Company
Stockholder's Pro Rata Share by (y) the Maximum Cash Threshold Amount (the
positive difference between such cash amount and the total cash amount elected
by a Company Stockholder in such Company Stockholder's Merger Consideration
Election Form, the "Cash Cutback"); provided that if and to the extent that
any such Company Stockholder is subject to a Cash Cutback, such Company
Stockholder shall be issued a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
representing cash value equivalent to the amount of such Cash Cutback (based
on the Parent Trading Price) in order to ensure that the total value of the
cash and the value of Parent Common Stock so issued to such Company
Stockholder as deal consideration, taken together, equals the aggregate amount
of value that such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Sections 1.7(a)(i), 1.7(a)(iii) or 1.7(a)(iv), as applicable.

(ii) If the amount of cash distributed pursuant to Sections 1.7(a)(i),
1.7(a)(iii) and 1.7(a)(iv) is less than the Maximum Cash Threshold Amount,
then each Company Stockholder (other than the Unaccredited Stockholders)
making an election to receive the Cash Election Shares or the Series B Cash
Election Shares, as applicable, shall have the right to receive an additional
amount of cash consideration based on such Company Stockholder's Pro Rata
Share until the first to occur of the following: (x) such Company Stockholder
has received all consideration such Company Stockholder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Sections 1.7(a)(i), 1.7(a)(iii) or 1.7(a)(iv), as applicable, or
(y) the aggregate amount of cash distributed as a component of Total
Consideration equals the Maximum Cash Consideration (the positive difference
between such cash amount and the total cash amount elected by a Company
Stockholder in such Company Stockholder's Merger Consideration Election Form,
the "Cash Ratchetback"), provided that if and to the extent that any such
Company Stockholder is subject to a Cash Ratchetback, such Company Stockholder
shall be issued a number of shares of Parent Common Stock representing cash
value equivalent to the amount of such Cash Ratchetback (based on the Parent
Trading Price) in order to ensure that the total value of the cash and the
value of Parent Common Stock so issued to such Company Stockholder as deal
consideration, taken together, equals the aggregate amount of value that such
Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Sections 1.7(a)(i), 1.7(a)(iii) or 1.7(a)(iv), as applicable; provided,
however, that the Maximum Cash Consideration shall be distributed ratably,
first, to the Unaccredited Stockholders and second to the Accredited
Stockholders.

(d) Fractional Shares. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in connection with the First Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock or Assumed Options that would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock or options to
purchase Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or options to purchase Parent Common Stock to be received
by such holder) shall be entitled to receive the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (or options to purchase Parent Common Stock)
(with 0.5 being rounded up) and an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction,
multiplied by (ii) the Parent Trading Price in respect of such remaining
fractional share; provided, however, that in no event shall the maximum amount
of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement exceed
the portion of the Aggregate Stock Election Parent Share Amount allocable to
the Stock Election Shares, the Aggregate Series B Stock Election Parent Share
Amount with respect to the Series B Stock Election Shares, the portion of the
Aggregate Mixed Election Parent Share Amount allocable to the Mixed Election
Shares or the portion of the Aggregate Series B Mixed Election Parent Share
Amount allocable to the Series B Mixed Election Shares.





-19- 



(e) Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Subs. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock of Sub I issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the First-Step
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub I evidencing ownership of
any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation. At the Second Effective Time,
each membership interest certificate, if any, of Sub II issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted into and
exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership
interest certificate of the Surviving Entity. Each membership interest
certificate, if any, of Sub II evidencing ownership of any such interests
shall continue to evidence ownership of such interests of the Surviving
Entity.

1.8 Calculation; Adjusted Working Capital Reconciliation.

(a) For purposes of calculating the amount of cash payable to each Company
Stockholder and each Cancelled Optionholder and each Voluntary Termination
Optionholder pursuant to this Article I, all shares of Company Capital Stock
and Cancelled Options held by each Company Stockholder and each Cancelled
Optionholder and each Voluntary Termination Optionholder shall be aggregated,
and the aggregate amount of cash issuable to each Company Stockholder and each
Cancelled Optionholder and each Voluntary Termination Optionholder shall be
rounded (up or down) to the nearest whole cent; provided, however, that in no
event shall the maximum amount of cash payable to all Company Stockholders and
Cancelled Optionholders and Voluntary Termination Optionholders pursuant to
this Agreement exceed the Maximum Cash Consideration.

(b) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall have delivered to Parent (i) a written statement (the "Estimated
Adjusted Working Capital Statement") which sets forth a good faith estimate of
the Adjusted Working Capital (the "Estimated Adjusted Working Capital"). The
Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Statement will have been prepared by the
Company in accordance with GAAP, applied using the same accounting methods,
practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent
classifications that were used in the preparation of the Financials (as
defined below). The Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Statement shall include
any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes (whether or not required in accordance with
GAAP). Parent and its representatives, including Parent's independent
accountants, will be entitled to review all work papers of the Company and its
representatives, including its independent accountants, prepared in connection
with the delivery of the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital Statement. Nothing
set forth in this Section 1.8(b) shall limit any rights of any party as set
forth in this Section 1.8 or of any Indemnified Party as set forth in Article
VI.

(c) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "AWC Reconciliation
Notice") of the actual amount of the Adjusted Working Capital of the Company
(the "Actual Adjusted Working Capital"), and the difference, if any, between
(i) the amount of Actual Adjusted Working Capital and the Estimated Adjusted
Working Capital. The Actual Adjusted Working Capital will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications that were
used in the preparation of the Financials. The AWC Reconciliation Notice shall
include any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes (whether or not required in accordance
with GAAP).

(d) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital set forth in the AWC Reconciliation Notice, the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver to Parent written notice of such dispute (the
"Dispute Notice") within 30 days of receipt of the AWC Reconciliation Notice,
which





-20- 



shall list with reasonable specificity the Stockholder Representative's points
of disagreement with Parent's calculation of the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital. The Stockholder Representative's failure to provide a Dispute Notice
within 30 days after receipt of the AWC Reconciliation Notice shall be deemed
an acceptance of such AWC Reconciliation Notice, and Parent's calculation of
the Actual Adjusted Working Capital. Upon receipt of the Dispute Notice, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall promptly consult with each other
with respect to the specified points of disagreement in an effort to resolve
the dispute.

(e) After the acceptance or final determination of the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital, if (i) the amount of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital is less than
(ii) the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital (the amount, if any, by which (i)
is less than (ii), the "Excess Consideration"), then the Excess Consideration
shall be paid to Parent out of the Escrow Amount in accordance with Article
VI. After the acceptance or final determination of the Actual Adjusted Working
Capital, if (iii) the amount of the Actual Adjusted Working Capital is greater
than (iv) the Estimated Adjusted Working Capital (the amount, if any, by which
(iii) is greater than (iv), the "Shortfall Consideration"), then the Shortfall
Consideration shall be paid in cash by Parent or the paying agent selected by
Parent to the Company Security Holders within five (5) Business Days of such
acceptance of final determination, in proportion to such Company Security
Holders' respective Pro Rata Share.

1.9 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, in trust, to a paying agent selected by Parent (the "Paying Agent"),
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, sufficient
funds for timely payment of the aggregate cash consideration payable (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Consideration Fund") to be paid
pursuant to this Article I in exchange for the applicable outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock.

(b) By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the indemnity
obligations provided for in Section 6.2 hereof, within two (2) Business Days
following the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct its transfer agent to
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount without any act of the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with Section 6.5(a) and the Spreadsheet.
For the avoidance of doubt, the recorded date of issuance for any shares of
Parent Common Stock deposited in respect of the Escrow Amount shall be the
Closing Date.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Company Stockholder (i) a letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit F and shall (A) specify that delivery of certificates representing
such Company Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Company Stock
Certificates") shall be deemed to have occurred, and, with respect to Company
Stock Certificates, risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the
Paying Agent, (B) include an undertaking to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement and a confirmation of the Stockholder Representative as the agent of
such holder pursuant to Section 6.7(a) for the purposes set forth herein, (C)
include an IRS Form W-9 or instructions on how to obtain IRS Form W-8BEN (or
other applicable Form W-8), as applicable, (D) include an undertaking to
indemnify Parent and the Surviving Entity for withholding Taxes with respect
to the applicable holder (including penalties and interest arising from
amounts not withheld pursuant to representations made by, or directions given
by, such holder) in the event the appropriate amount of Taxes is not withheld
from payments made to the applicable holder as required by applicable law, and
(E) include any other information required pursuant to any applicable law and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificates in exchange for payment





-21- 



of the cash consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to
Section 1.7 as specified in the Spreadsheet. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate for cancellation to Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and properly completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, within three (3) Business Days thereafter, Paying Agent
shall (y) pay to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate (each such
holder, a "Surrendering Holder") the cash consideration that such Surrendering
Holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.7, as specified in the Spreadsheet,
after giving effect to any withholding Tax required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable Law, and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled and (z) promptly notify Parent via email of such
cancellation, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after each such
cancellation. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash consideration
payable to holders of Company Stock Certificates. Upon the date that is one
month following the Closing Date, and upon each one month anniversary
thereafter, Parent shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following such anniversary) issue the applicable stock
consideration pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.7, as specified in the
Spreadsheet, in exchange for Company Stock Certificates surrendered in
accordance with clause (z) above during such one month period, until
notification that all Company Stock Certificates have been so surrendered and
the applicable consideration for such Company Stock Certificates has been so
issued. For the avoidance of doubt, the recorded date of issuance for any such
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be the Closing Date.

(d) Within two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
make available to the Surviving Entity the cash payable at the Effective Time
with respect to (i) the Cancelled Options pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i)(B) and
(ii) the Voluntary Termination Options pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i)(C). The
Surviving Entity shall serve as the payor for the consideration payable with
respect to the Cancelled Options and the Voluntary Termination Options. The
Stockholder Representative shall be responsible for instructing the Surviving
Entity as to the distribution of such amounts then deposited. The Surviving
Entity may rely on the instructions of the Stockholder Representative for
distributions and shall have no responsibility or liability with respect
thereto; provided, that the distribution instructions of the Stockholder
Representative are followed.

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall surrender the certificate(s)
representing the shares of Sub I to the First-Step Surviving Corporation, and
the First-Step Surviving Corporation shall issue to Parent in exchange
therefor a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of
common stock of First-Step Surviving Corporation to which Parent is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.7(c).

(f) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in a U.S.
Bank Money Market Deposit Account, as fully described on the attached Exhibit
G; provided, however, that (i) no gain or loss thereon or income or loss
generated thereby shall affect the amounts payable by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Entity, and no part of such
earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Capital Stock. To
the extent that any losses cause the Consideration Fund to become less than
the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant to this Article I, Parent
shall within two (2) Business Days deposit additional cash into the
Consideration Fund such that it is no longer less than such amount.

(g) Transfers of Ownership. If the cash payment or check evidencing the cash
to be paid pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof or a cash payment or check
evidencing the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares is to be made to a
Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock





-22- 



Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Total
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(h) Paying Agent to Return Consideration. Any funds that have not been
distributed to the former Company Stockholders within twelve (12) months after
such funds were received by the Paying Agent shall be delivered to the
Surviving Entity. Any former Company Stockholder who has not theretofore
complied with this Section 1.9 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Entity for any consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof in
respect of each share of Company Capital Stock such Person held, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(i) No Liability. None of the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent, the First-
Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity, any Affiliate of the
foregoing or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
portion of the Total Consideration and any portion of the Escrow Amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

1.10 Legends on Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Security Entitlements.

(a) The certificates or book-entry security entitlements representing shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the First Merger, or any
other securities issued in respect of such shares upon any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or similar event, shall bear
the following legend (in addition to any legend required by applicable state
securities laws):

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT") AND MAY NOT BE
OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND
UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE 1933 ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL
SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER,
PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE THEREWITH.

1.11 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by stockholders who have exercised and perfected
appraisal rights for such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with
Delaware Law or dissenters' rights under Chapter 13 of the California
Corporations Code (the "CCC"), if applicable (the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive any consideration
pursuant to Section 1.7 hereto. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the
CCC, if applicable, to a holder of Dissenting Shares, unless and until such
Company Stockholders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose
their appraisal rights under Delaware Law or their dissenters' rights under
Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable. All Dissenting Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their right to appraisal of such shares of Company Capital
Stock under the DGCL or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable, shall
thereupon be deemed to have been





-23- 



converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive that portion of the Total Consideration payable in
respect of shares of Company Capital Stock as set forth in Section 1.7(a)
hereof, without any interest thereon and less any applicable Tax withholding,
upon the surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company
Capital Stock.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the
CCC, if applicable, and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under Delaware Law or under Chapter 13 of the CCC, if applicable. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands, unless and to the extent it is required to do so under
applicable law.

1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The portion of the
Total Consideration paid or payable in respect of the surrender for exchange
of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

1.13 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or
agreements, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such consideration, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
1.7 hereof or the Spreadsheet, as applicable; provided, however, that the
Paying Agent may, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the Company Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates to agree to indemnify Parent and the Paying Agent (and in the
event a bond is required by the Paying Agent or Parent's transfer agent,
deliver a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent or the transfer agent may
reasonably request) against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Paying Agent with respect to the certificates or agreements alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.14 Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent and the Surviving
Entity, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of
U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law or under any applicable legal
requirement, and to request and be provided any necessary Tax forms, including
IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate version of Form W-8, as applicable, or any
similar information. To the extent any such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all amounts so withheld to
the appropriate taxing authority within the period required under applicable
law.

1.15 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company, Parent, the Merger Subs, and the officers and
directors of the Company, Parent and the Merger





-24- 



Subs are fully authorized in the name of their respective entities or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

executed Stockholder Written Consent evidencing the Company's receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Vote adopting this





-53- 



Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including (A) the deposit
of the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent, (B) the appointment of the
Stockholders' Representative as the agent and attorney-in-fact for the Company
Stockholders, having the powers and rights regarding indemnification set forth
herein, and (C) the Series A Preferred Conversion.

(b) The Company shall deliver to each Company Stockholder, along with the
Information Statement, (i) a Stockholder Questionnaire in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit H pursuant to which such Company Stockholder will indicate
whether such Company Stockholder qualifies as an Accredited Investor and (ii)
a Merger Consideration Election Form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I
(the "Merger Consideration Election Form") permitting Accredited Stockholders
to specify whether such holder elects to receive Stock Election Shares, Mixed
Election Shares, Cash Election Shares, Series B Stock Election Shares, Series
B Mixed Election Shares or Series B Cash Election Shares, as applicable. Any
such election shall have been properly made only if Parent shall have actually
received a properly completed Merger Consideration Election Form or such
election is deemed properly made pursuant to the last sentence of this Section
4.2(b). Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Stockholder
Questionnaire or Merger Consideration Election Form, as applicable, Parent
shall have sole discretion to determine whether any Company Stockholder
qualifies as an Accredited Investor and whether any election has been properly
or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Merger Consideration
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of Parent regarding such matters
shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the Merger Subs or the
Company shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a
Stockholder Questionnaire or Merger Consideration Election Form. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent
Stockholder Questionnaires duly executed by Company Stockholders representing
90% of the outstanding Company Capital Stock and Parent Merger Consideration
Election Forms duly executed by Accredited Stockholders representing 90% of
the outstanding Company Capital Stock held by Accredited Stockholders. A
Company Stockholder who does not return a properly completed Stockholder
Questionnaire to the Company or Parent by the Closing will be deemed to not be
an Accredited Investor, and a Company Stockholder that is an Accredited
Investor, who does not return a properly completed Merger Consideration
Election Form to the Company or Parent by the Closing will be deemed to have
elected to receive Stock Election Shares or Series B Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, in respect of such Company Stockholder's shares of Company Capital
Stock.

(c) Promptly following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
to Parent, prior to the solicitation of the requisite Company Stockholder
approval described in Section 4.2(d), a 280G Waiver from each Person in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit J (the "280G Waiver") whom the Company
reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to
the initiation of the solicitation of the requisite Company Stockholder
approval described in Section 4.2(d), and who might otherwise receive or have
the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of
the Code, unless the requisite Company Stockholder approval of such parachute
payments is obtained pursuant to Section 4.2(d).

(d) Promptly following the delivery by the Company to Parent of each 280G
Waiver described in Section 4.2(b), the Company shall submit to the Company
Stockholders for approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent) by
such number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any payments and/or benefits that are subject to a
280G Waiver and that Parent reasonably determines, or that Company reasonably
determines, may separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed to be





-54- 



"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, and prior to the
Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (i) that a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and
the requisite Company Stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any
payments and/or benefits that were subject to the Company Stockholder vote
(the "280G Approval") or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be made or provided,
pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or benefits which were executed
by the affected individuals on the date of this Agreement.

(e) The Soliciting Materials shall be subject to review and approval by Parent
and shall include information regarding the Company, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the deposit of the Escrow Amount with the
Escrow Agent, the appointment of the Stockholders' Representative as the agent

Conversion and the unanimous recommendation of the Board in favor of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the deposit of the Escrow
Amount with the Escrow Agent, the appointment of the Stockholders'
Representative as the agent and attorney-in-fact for the Company Stockholders,
and the Series A Preferred Conversion. The Company will promptly advise Parent
in writing if at any time prior to the Closing the Company obtains Knowledge
of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Information Statement or any other Soliciting Materials in
order to make statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law. Parent will promptly advise the
Company in writing if at any time prior to the Closing Parent obtains
knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or
supplement the Information Statement or any other Soliciting Materials in
order to make statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the
Soliciting Materials any information with respect to Parent or its affiliates
or associates, the form and content of which shall not have been consented to
in writing by Parent prior to such inclusion, except as required pursuant to
applicable law.

withdraw, alter, modify, change or revoke its approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby nor its recommendation to the Company
Stockholders to vote in favor of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Parent until Closing. In this regard, the Company acknowledges that the Parent
Common Stock is publicly traded and that any information obtained during the
course of its due diligence could be considered to be material non‑public

Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and agrees not to engage in any
discussions, correspondence or transactions in the Parent Common Stock in
violation of applicable securities laws.

4.4 Public Disclosure. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not (nor will
it permit, as applicable, any of its officers, directors, members, employees,
stockholders, agents, partners, representatives or affiliates to), directly or
indirectly (other than as specifically contemplated hereby), issue any
statement or communication to any third party (other than its agents or
representatives that are bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,





-55- 



including, if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons
therefor or any disputes or arbitration proceedings, without the consent of
Parent, except as may be required by applicable regulatory, administrative or
legal requirements; provided, however, that in such event, the Company shall,
or shall cause such Person, to give Parent prompt written notice of such
obligation to enable Parent to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent
such disclosure and that the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent to obtain such protective order or other appropriate
remedy. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not (nor will it permit, as
applicable, any of its officers, directors, members, employees, stockholders,

including, if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons
therefor or any disputes or arbitration proceedings, without the consent of
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), in each case of
the foregoing, except as may be required by applicable regulatory,
administrative or legal requirements, including the rules and regulations of
the Securities Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.

4.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions provided in

to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do

advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby, to cause all conditions to the
obligations of the other parties hereto to cause the First Merger to occur, to
obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other documents required
to be delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary registrations and
filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or
otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties
hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to agree to (a) any license,
sale or other disposition or holding separate (through establishment of a
trust or otherwise) of any shares of its capital stock or of any of its
businesses, assets or properties, its subsidiaries or affiliates, (b) the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or
affiliates or the Company to conduct their respective businesses or own any
capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of their respective businesses and, in the case of Parent, the
business of the Company, or (c) the imposition of any impediment on Parent,
its subsidiaries or affiliates or the Company under any statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing
competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices (any such action
described in (a), (b) or (c), an "Action of Divestiture"). Nothing herein
shall require Parent or the Company to litigate with any third party,
including without limitation, any Governmental Entity.

4.6 Termination of 401(k) Plan. Effective as of no later than the day

Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plans shall not
be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that each 401(k) Plan has been terminated
(effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board, or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may
be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating each 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties as are required
thereunder in connection with the Mergers or for any such Material Contracts
to remain in full force and effect, all of which are required to be listed in
Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, so as to preserve all rights of, and

making any payments required to terminate the Terminated Agreements and shall
indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless Parent and the Surviving Entity
from all Losses arising from the same and shall reflect such payment or other
consideration incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date or anticipated to
be incurred or payable after the Closing on the Statement of Expenses. In the
event the First Merger does not close for any reason (other than pursuant to a
termination under Section 7.1(g)), Parent shall not have any Liability to the
Company or any other Person for any costs, claims, Liabilities or damages
resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such terminations.

4.9 Notices. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to send each of the notices set forth in Annex 10 to Appendix C

intended by the parties hereto that the Mergers shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, Parent
makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any Company
Security Holder that the Mergers will qualify as a tax-free "reorganization"

to be performed after the Closing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the
liability of any Indemnifying Party, and the Escrow Amount shall not be the
exclusive remedy, in respect of (i) Losses (A) arising out of the
Indemnifiable Matters described in clauses (ii) through (x) of Section 6.2(a)
or (B) with respect to any Fundamental Matter, or (ii) Losses arising out of
fraud, any intentional misrepresentation or intentional or





-62- 



willful breach of or related to this Agreement, any Certificate, the
Spreadsheet or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (such
Losses described in components (i) and (ii) of the foregoing sentence,
collectively, the "Outside Escrow Matters"), in which case the liability of
the Indemnifying Parties shall be several and not joint and the maximum amount
that the Indemnified Parties may recover from each Indemnifying Party for such
Losses shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Total
Consideration received by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 1.7;
provided, however, that the Escrow Amount shall be the first source of
indemnification for any claims arising out of the Outside Escrow Matters, and
no such claims may be satisfied against an Indemnifying Party until the Escrow
Amount has been exhausted; provided, further that in no event shall an
Indemnified Party be entitled to recover for the same Loss under more than one
clause of Section 6.2; provided, further, that there shall be no limitation on
the amount that the Indemnified Parties may recover from an Indemnifying Party
for Losses arising out of any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
intentional or willful breach committed by such Indemnifying Party of or
related to this Agreement, any Certificate, the Spreadsheet or other
instrument delivered committed by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement.

(b) Nothing in this Article VI shall limit the Liability of Parent, Sub I, Sub
II or the Company for any willful breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, any Certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement if the First Merger does not close.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any Indemnified Party may bring a
claim for indemnification for any Loss under this Article VI notwithstanding
the fact that such Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event or
circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto (other than knowledge arising
directly out of the disclosures explicitly set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, provided, that such disclosures are not qualified as being disclosed
for informational purposes or otherwise described as not limiting the
Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement).
The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations).

(d) Except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 6.3(d), an
Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under Section 6.2(a)(i) hereof
unless and until one or more Officer's Certificates identifying such Losses
under Section 6.2(a)(i) hereof in excess of $1,200,000 in the aggregate (the
"Basket") has or have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder
Representative as provided in Section 6.4(a) hereof, and such amount is
payable in accordance with this Article VI, at which time such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover all Losses so identified in full from the
first dollar (including the amount of the Basket). The provisions of this
Section 6.3(d) shall not apply to any and all claims or payments made with
respect to all Losses incurred with respect to the Outside Escrow Matters or
the matters set forth on Schedule 6.2(a)(xi) hereto.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Indemnifying
Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article VI for any Losses to the extent that any Indemnified Party actually
receives proceeds from insurance to pay such Losses, net of costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the collection of such amounts; provided, however,
that no Indemnified Party shall be required to seek any insurance or maintain
any such insurance policies or other coverage. The Indemnified Party shall
promptly refund any amount it actually receives (net of costs and expenses,
incurred in connection with the collection of such amount) pursuant to the
preceding sentence from insurance to the extent it actually receives such
amount after payment by any Indemnifying Party.

6.4 Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts.

(a) Making a Claim for Indemnification; Officer's Certificate.

(i) An Indemnified Party may seek recovery of Losses pursuant to this Article
VI by delivering to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative (and,
in the case of recovery sought directly from one or more Indemnifying Parties
directly, delivering to such Indemnifying Party) an Officer's Certificate in
respect of such claim. The date of such delivery of an Officer's Certificate
is referred to herein as the "Claim Date" of such Officer's Certificate (and
the claims for indemnification contained therein). For purposes hereof,
"Officer's Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent: (A) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred or
accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur or
accrue Losses and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of
Losses included in the amount so stated and the nature of the Indemnifiable
Matter to which such item is related.

(ii) In the event that an Indemnified Party pursues a claim directly against
any Indemnifying Party, subject to the provisions of Section 6.3, Section
6.4(b) and Section 6.4(c) hereof, each Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and
in no event later than thirty (30) days after delivery of an Officer's
Certificate to such Indemnifying Party, wire transfer to the Indemnified Party
an amount of cash equal to the amount of the Loss.

(b) Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification.

(i) The Stockholder Representative (or, in the case of a claim directly
against one or more Indemnifying Parties, such Indemnifying Parties) may
object to a claim for indemnification set forth in an Officer's Certificate by
delivering to the Indemnified Party seeking indemnification and the Escrow
Agent a written statement of objection to the claim made in the Officer's
Certificate (an "Objection Notice"), provided that, to be effective, such
Objection Notice must (i) be delivered to the Indemnified Party prior to
midnight (California time) on the thirtieth (30th) day following the Claim
Date of the Officer's Certificate (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline" for
such Officer's Certificate and the claims for indemnification contained
therein) and (ii) set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the objections
to the claims in respect of which the objection is made. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Stockholder Representative and each Indemnifying Party hereby
waive the right to object to any claim, against the Escrow Amount or
otherwise, in respect of any Escrow Agent-Related Loss.

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, in the
event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party) does not object in writing (as provided in Section
6.4(b)(i)) to the claims contained in an Officer's Certificate prior to the
Objection Deadline for such Officer's Certificate, such failure to so object
shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative and
the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claims for Losses set forth in such Officer's Certificate (and
such entitlement shall be conclusively and irrefutably established) (any such
claim, an "Unobjected Claim") and, subject to the applicable provisions of
Section 6.3 the Escrow Agent shall release such amount from the Escrow Amount
in accordance with the terms of such Officer's Certificate. With respect to
such release, the Escrow Agent shall cause to be released from escrow cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock that in the aggregate equal the amount of such
Losses with shares of Parent Common Stock being valued at the Trading Price,
with such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock being released from the
escrow in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the value of cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock then in escrow, provided that no





-64- 



fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock will be released from escrow.
Claims against the Escrow Amount made in respect of any Escrow Agent-Related
Loss shall be resolved in the manner described in this Section 6.4(b)(ii) and
shall be considered an Unobjected Claim.

(cl) Resolution of Conflicts. In case the Stockholder Representative (or the
Indemnifying Parties in the case of a claim for indemnification sought
directly from an Indemnifying Party) timely delivers an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 6.4(b)(i) hereof (other than in connection with Escrow
Agent-Related Losses), the Escrow Agent shall not make any distribution on
claims specified in an Objection Notice until agreement is reached or as
provided in this Section 6.4(c), and the Stockholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.
Either party may, but shall not be obligated to, initiate non‑binding
mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral arbitrator belonging
to and under the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution. The party
requesting the mediation shall arrange for mediation services, subject to the
approval of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Mediation shall take place in Santa Clara County, California during reasonable
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice. Mediation may be scheduled
to begin at any time, but with at least ten (10) Business Days' written notice
to all parties. If one party initiates mediation, the parties (i) shall
participate in the mediation in good faith and shall devote reasonable time
and energy to the mediation so as to promptly resolve the dispute or conclude
that they cannot resolve the dispute and (ii) shall not pursue other remedies
while such mediation is proceeding. If the Stockholder Representative (or the
objecting Indemnifying Parties) and Parent reach an agreement, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and,
in the case of a claim against the Escrow Amount, shall be furnished to the
Escrow Agent and, in the case of a claim directly against the Indemnifying
Parties, furnished to the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms thereof.

6.5 Escrow Arrangements.

(a) Escrow Amount. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
indemnity obligations provided for in Section 6.2 hereof, promptly following
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent will deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount
without any act of the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the Spreadsheet
in accordance with Section 1.7 and this Article VI. The Escrow Amount shall be
available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties
for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to
recovery under this Article VI.

(b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period. The Escrow
Period shall end at 5:00 p.m., local time on the Survival Date (the "Escrow
Period"). On the next Business Day, the Escrow Agent shall distribute or cause
to be distributed, the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, if any, to the
Indemnifying Parties; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall continue
to withhold an amount in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock (with Parent
Common Stock valued at the Trading Price) equal to any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Officer's Certificate ("Unresolved Claims") delivered to the
Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative prior to the termination of
the Escrow Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to
the Survival Date, and any such property shall not be distributed to the
Indemnifying Parties at such time. As soon as all such claims have been
resolved, the Escrow Agent and Parent shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Parties the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, if any, not required to
satisfy such Unresolved Claims. Deliveries of the remaining portion of the
Escrow Amount to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Section 6.5(b)
shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata





-65- 



Portions of the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, if any, with any
shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to each Indemnifying Party rounded to
the nearest whole share (with a fractional share of 0.5 and above rounded up).
If the sum of the Pro Rata Portions together with any cash released, with
shares of Parent Common Stock rounded to the nearest whole share (with a
fractional share of 0.5 and above rounded up), does not equal the remaining
portion of the Escrow Amount, then the appropriate amount will be added to or
subtracted from the Indemnifying Party with the greatest Pro Rata Portion such
that the sum of the rounded Pro Rata Portions does equal the remaining portion
of the Escrow Amount. In the case of the Escrow Amount, if the sum of the Pro
Rata Portions, with shares of Parent Common Stock rounded to the nearest whole
share (with a fractional share of 0.5 and above rounded up), does not equal
the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount, then the appropriate amount will
be added to or subtracted from the Indemnifying Party with the greatest Pro
Rata Portion such that the sum of the rounded Pro Rata Portions does equal the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount.

(c) Release of Escrow with Respect to Amounts Payable to the Key Stockholders.
The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that a portion of the amounts
otherwise payable to the Key Stockholders in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereunder and pursuant to their respective
Restriction Agreements on the applicable vesting dates after the Closing will
be retained and held back by Parent in accordance with Schedule 6.5(c) hereto
and as set forth in the Spreadsheet without any act of such Key Stockholders.
Notwithstanding Section 6.5(b), upon termination of the Escrow Period, the
Escrow Agent shall distribute, or cause to be distributed, the remaining
portion, if any, of the Escrow Amount attributed to amounts payable to the Key
Stockholders pursuant to their respective Restriction Agreements (subject to
last two sentences of Section 6.5(b)) after the Closing to the Key
Stockholders on the later of (i) the applicable vesting date, subject to each
such Key Stockholders continuing to be employed by Parent through such date
and further subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to the
accelerated vesting of such payments, if applicable, as set forth in such Key
Stockholder's Restriction Agreement and (ii) the resolution of any Unresolved
Claims.

(d) Protection of the Escrow Amount. The parties agree that, except to the
extent there is a cancellation of shares of Parent Common Stock which make up
the Escrow Amount in connection with Losses resulting from an Indemnifiable
Matter, shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Escrow Agent shall be
treated by Parent as issued and outstanding stock of Parent, and that "U.S.
Bank National Association, as Escrow Agent" shall be shown as the record
holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock that constitute the Escrow Amount
(which such shares being held by the Escrow Agent in escrow for the benefit of
the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the terms herein). The Escrow Agent shall
exercise its voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
which make up the Escrow Amount in accordance with the instructions provided
by the Stockholder Representative or, if applicable, any holder who provides
voting instructions directly to the Escrow Agent. Upon receiving any dividends
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock which make up the Escrow
Amount, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days after receiving such dividend, distribute such amounts to each
Indemnifying Party based on its Pro Rata Portion.

(e) Escrow Agent's Duties

(i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying
or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or





-66- 



parties. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.

(ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all
warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting
only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any
court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to
any other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order,
judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside,
vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

(iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

(v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except for gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. Subject to
the foregoing sentence, the Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability
for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any
action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written
statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent
shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable
or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope
of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult
with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agent's duties
under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered,
or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the
authority of any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to
this Agreement.

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy
or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents
and the Escrow Amount and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by
final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agent's
discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages.
Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the
clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow, except
all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader
Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: 50% to be paid by
Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of the
Indemnifying Parties' respective Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that in
the event any Indemnifying Party fails to timely pay his, her or its Pro Rata
Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may
at its option upon prior written notice to the Stockholder Representative pay
such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses
and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed an Escrow Agent-Related
Loss) from such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the





-67- 



Escrow Amount. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
released and discharged of and from all obligations and Liability imposed by
the terms of this Agreement.

(vii) Parent and the Indemnifying Parties and their respective successors and
assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and
expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including
allocated costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on
Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of
its duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation
arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those
arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent
(the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent
and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of the
Indemnifying Parties' respective Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that in
the event any Indemnifying Party fails to timely pay his, her or its Pro Rata
Portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, the parties agree that Parent
may at its option upon prior written notice to the Stockholder Representative
pay such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification
Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed an Agreed-Upon
Loss) from such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount.
Losses in respect of Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification
Expenses shall be referred to herein as "Escrow Agent-Related Losses" and
each, an "Escrow Agent-Related Loss."

(viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty
(30) days written notice to Parent and the Stockholder Representative;
provided, however, that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent
within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to
agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall
have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business
in the State of California. The successor escrow agent shall execute and
deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further
acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties
of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon
appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged
from any further duties and Liability under this Agreement.

(f) Fees. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder
shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the
Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for
services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary
services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions
of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders
any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a
substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the
Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining
to the Escrow Amount or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be
reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all
costs, reasonable attorney's fees, including allocated costs of in-house
counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or
litigation.

(g) Successor Escrow Agents. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.





-68- 



6.6 Third Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a
demand against the Escrow Amount or other indemnification pursuant to this
Article VI, Parent shall promptly notify the Stockholder Representative (or,
in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such claim (which such notice
shall include a summary in reasonable detail of the basis of the Third Party
Claim and to the extent practicable a reasonable estimate of the Losses), and
the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly
from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled), at
their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense
of such Third Party Claim. The failure to so notify the Stockholder
Representative shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties of any liability,
except to the extent and only to the extent the Stockholder Representative
demonstrates that the defense of such action is materially prejudiced thereby.
If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined would give rise
to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred by the
Indemnified Parties in defense of such Third Party Claim shall be deemed
Losses hereunder. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; provided, however,
that, in the event that the consent of the Stockholder Representative (or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) is not obtained, indemnifiable Losses shall
include reasonable amounts paid in settlement (and, for the avoidance doubt,
shall not include unreasonable amounts paid in settlement); provided further,
however, that the consent of the Stockholder Representative with respect to
any settlement of any such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been
given unless the Stockholder Representative shall have objected within twenty
(20) days after a written request for such consent by Parent. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VI to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent
against the Escrow Amount, or against the Indemnifying Parties directly, as
the case may be, with respect to such settlement.

6.7 Stockholder Representative.

(a) Steven Goodman is hereby appointed as the agent and attorney‑in‑fact of
the Indemnifying Parties as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf
of the Indemnifying Parties to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such payments, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms
of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from
time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent;
provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed
unless the former holders of a majority of Company Capital Stock (including
for this purpose shares of Company Common Stock underlying Company Options)
agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy
in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the former
holders of a majority of Company Capital Stock (including for this purpose
shares of Company Common Stock underlying Company Options). No bond shall be
required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative
shall not receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications
to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from
the Stockholder Representatives (including the Indemnifying Parties).





-69- 



(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Indemnifying Parties from whom the
Escrow Amount was withheld shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and
hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, Liability or
expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representative's duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholder Representative.

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative,
including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 and Section 7.4 hereof, shall constitute a
decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties. Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Indemnifying Parties.
Parent is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative.

6.8 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The parties hereto agree to treat
(and cause their Affiliates to treat) any payments received pursuant to this
Article VI as adjustments to the Total Consideration for all Tax purposes, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws.

8.2 Interpretation. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

8.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually
executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. A facsimile, telecopy or other reproduction of this Agreement may
be executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party by
facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which the
signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen. Such execution and
delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes.

8.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the
Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents
and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced
herein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder, and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately
liable for all of Parent's obligations hereunder.

8.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.6 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof,





-73- 



this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity and the parties hereby agree to waive any requirements for
posting a bond in connection with any such action.

8.7 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

8.8 Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to Section 2 of Appendix A attached
hereto and Section 6.4(c) hereof, each of the parties hereto irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within Santa
Clara County, State of California, in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that
process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the
State of California for such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction,
venue and such process. Subject to Section 6.4(c) hereof, each party agrees
not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such courts.

8.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. For
the avoidance of doubt, the phrases "as of the date hereof", "as of the date
of this Agreement" or words of similar import as used herein shall mean "as of
February 6, 2014" (i.e., the date this Agreement was executed).

8.10 Certain Procedures for Opening an Escrow Account. To help the government
fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law
requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information
that identifies each Person who opens an account. For a non-individual Person
such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow
Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a
legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.

8.11 Optional Security Measures. In the event funds transfer instructions,
address changes or change in contact information are given (other than in
writing at the time of execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by
facsimile or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized but shall be under no
duty to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the
person or persons designated on Schedule 8.11 hereto, and the Escrow Agent may
rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so
designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed
only in writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent and shall
be effective only after Escrow Agent has a reasonable opportunity to act on
such changes. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the designated
representatives identified in Schedule 8.11, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized but shall be under no duty to seek confirmation of such
instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of Parent's executive
officers, which shall include the titles of Chief Executive Officer, President
and Vice President, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such executive officer
shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and
the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any
such officer. Parent and Stockholder Representative agree that the Escrow
Agent may at its option record any





-74- 



telephone calls made pursuant to this Section. The Escrow Agent in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by Parent or Shareholder Representative to identify (a) the
beneficiary, (b) the beneficiary\'s bank, or (c) an intermediary bank. The
Escrow Agent may apply any of the Escrow Funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a
person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiary\'s bank or an intermediary bank designated.
Parent and Shareholder Representative acknowledge that these optional security
procedures are commercially reasonable.

2. No Solicitation. 

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing, or (ii) the date of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1 of this Agreement,

any of its affiliates permit any of its officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents, representatives or affiliates to), directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with any party other than Parent
and its designees: (A) solicit, initiate, participate in or knowingly
encourage any negotiations



or discussions with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or a
material portion of the Company's business or properties, or any equity
interest in the Company or shares of Company Capital Stock or any rights to
acquire any shares of Company Capital Stock or other equity interests in the
Company, regardless of the form of transaction (a "Competing Transaction"), or
effect any such transaction, (B) disclose any information to any Person
concerning the business or properties of the Company, or afford to any Person

in the ordinary course of business, (C) assist or cooperate with any Person to

agreement with any Person providing for a Competing Transaction. In the event
that the Company, or any of its affiliates shall receive, prior to the earlier
of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1 of this Agreement, any offer, proposal, or request, directly or
indirectly, of the type referenced in clause (A), (C) or (D) above, or any
request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (B) above, the

(and in any event within 24 hours of such event) notify Parent thereof,
including information as to the identity of the Person making any such offer
or proposal and the specific terms of such offer or proposal, as the case may
be, and such other information related thereto as Parent may reasonably
request, including, but not limited to a copy of any written inquiry, offer or
proposal or a summary of the principal terms of any such inquiry, offer or
proposal that is not in writing; provided, however, that to the extent the
disclosure of any such information would require the Company to breach any
non-disclosure agreement existing prior to the date hereof and disclosed on
the Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall not be required to disclose such
information but will inform Parent as to the existence of any such Competing
Transaction and its good faith opinion (based upon the advice of legal counsel
and its financial advisors) as to whether the Competing Transaction is
inferior or superior from a financial point of view to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that the provisions of Section 2(a) were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 2 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
above by any officer, director, agent, representative or affiliate of the
Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

3. Access to Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access (subject to applicable law relating to the exchange of information) to (a) all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments and records of the Company, including all Company IP (including access to design processes and methodologies and all source code), (b) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company as Parent may reasonably request, and (c) all Employees of the Company as identified by Parent. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 3 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the First Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof.



4. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall give prompt notice to the other parties of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, respectively and as the case may be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing, (b) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and (c) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice or constitute an acknowledgement or admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company, or Parent pursuant to this Section 4, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of representation or warranty or breach of covenant.





APPENDIX B



CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY TO EFFECT THE FIRST MERGER

2. No Injunctions; Restraints; Illegality.
