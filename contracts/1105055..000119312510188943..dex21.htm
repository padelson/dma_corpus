upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, at the
Effective Time, NRG will purchase and assume, and Merger Sub will sell and

Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _ _DGCL__ ") and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the

shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL and in this Agreement.

 

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New
York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the third (3rd) business day
following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement; _provided_ , however, if it does not become reasonably
apparent to the parties hereto that such conditions are likely to be satisfied
(other than the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a), which shall, for
purposes of determining whether a condition is reasonably apparent to the
parties to be satisfied under this proviso, be deemed to be satisfied at all
times) as of a particular date until the date that is eight (8) calendar days
or fewer prior to such anticipated satisfaction date, the Closing will occur
on the later to occur of (a) such third (3rd) business day following the day
on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement
and (b) the eleventh (11th) calendar day (or, if such day is not a business
day, the next business day) after it becomes reasonably apparent that such
conditions are likely to be satisfied as of a particular date. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _ _Closing Date__
". For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean
any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or
other day on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of
New York.

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the " _ _Delaware
Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of

 



 

-2-  Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in writing
and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__
").

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _Certificate of Incorporation and_

 

 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_

 

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended in connection with the completion of the Merger
so as to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so
amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _ _Charter__ "), until duly amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.11(e)).

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _ _Bylaws__ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 6.11(e)).

ARTICLE III

 

 _Officers and Directors_

 

 _of the Surviving Corporation_

 

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the holder of any
capital stock of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:



 

-3- (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _
_Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company
or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties (the " _ _Affiliated Shares__ "),
and (ii) Shares owned by stockholders (" _ _Dissenting Stockholders__ ") who
have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to,
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Shares
(the " _ _Dissenting Shares__ ," and together with the Affiliated Shares, the
" _ _Excluded Shares__ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $4.50
per Share in cash (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ "), without
interest. Except as provided in Section 4.1(b), at the Effective Time, all of
the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") formerly representing
any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Share,
without interest.

 

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Affiliated
Share shall not represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration and shall convert into one share of a class of stock of the
Surviving Corporation designated by Parent. Each Dissenting Share, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the
Record Holder of any Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(g). As used in this Article IV, the
term " _ _Record Holder__ " means, with respect to any Shares, a Person who
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of record of such
Shares.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and each share of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be
converted into the right to receive one share of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights and
preferences.

 

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Companys prior
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of
Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds obtained pursuant to the
Equity Financing necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section
4.1(a) (such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange
Fund__ "). The parties acknowledge and agree that, in accordance with the
Equity Financing Commitment, the



 

-4-  capitalization of Parent may be effected directly or indirectly through one
or more affiliated entities or other designated co-investors of BCP (other
than NRG or any of its Affiliates), including with debt financing to the
extent available from lenders other than NRG or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (it being understood that in connection with the Closing
no credit support in connection with any such debt financing or
capitalization of Parent will be provided by the Company or any of its
Affiliates and that no new Indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, may be
used in the provision of funding to the Paying Agent for the Exchange Fund),
and the Equity Financing shall be comprised of funds obtained pursuant to such
capitalization. If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand
for, or loses its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, (i) such Shares shall cease to be
Excluded Shares and (ii) Parent shall make available or cause to be made
available to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of Dissenting Shares for which such Dissenting
Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or lost its rights to, appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the aggregate amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(e). To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent
to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
under Section 4.1(a).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within two (2) business
days), after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to
be in customary form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) in exchange for the amount to which such Record
Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a). If
any Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares pursuant to Section 4.2(a),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent promptly (and in any
event within two (2) business days) after such Excluded Shares cease to be
Excluded Shares to mail to the Record Holder of such Shares the letter of
transmittal 



 

-5-  and instructions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, with
respect to such Shares. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any
Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly
executed in accordance with its instructions and the surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(f)), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(h)) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(f)) and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance
with the procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the
applicable letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and the Depository Trust Company (" _ _DTC__ ") to ensure that (i) if the
Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date,
the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount,
the " _ _DTC Payment__ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m.
(Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominee on the first (1st) business day after the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of the Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any Record Holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result
of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu

 



 

-6-  thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Record
Holders of Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interests of
any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term
" _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature (including any person as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), (ii) the term " _ _Law__ " or " _ _Laws__ "
shall mean any domestic or foreign laws, statutes, ordinances, rules
(including rules of common law), regulations, codes, Orders or
legally enforceable requirements enacted, issued, adopted, or promulgated by
any Governmental Entity and any judicial interpretation thereof and (iii) the
term " _ _Final Order__ " shall mean action by the relevant Governmental
Entity which has not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or
suspended, with respect to which any waiting period prescribed by Law before
the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated has expired, and as to
which all conditions (other than conditions the satisfaction of which are
within the control of a party) to the consummation of such transactions
prescribed by Law have been satisfied.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and (ii) the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

 

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have
effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right to, appraisal under
the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and until a Dissenting
Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn its demand for, or lost its right
to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, each
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and shall

 



 

-7-  give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable in respect of the Shares cancelled in the Merger such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _
_Code__ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Record Holder of
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and
the applicable holder, each outstanding Company Stock Option (as defined in
Section 5.1(b)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled for no payment if such
option has an exercise price greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration
and, if such option exercise price is not greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to the Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share
under such Company Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment.

(b) _Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of

(E) any decline in the market price, or change in trading volume, of any

shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any event, change
or occurrence underlying such decline has resulted in, or contributed to, a
Company Material Adverse Effect);

this clause shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any
event, effect, change, circumstance or occurrence underlying such change has

_provided_ , _however_ , that the events, effects, circumstances, changes
and occurrences set forth in clauses (A), (B), (C), (K) and (L) above shall
be taken into account in determining whether a " _ _Company Material Adverse
Effect__ " has occurred to the extent (but only to such extent) such changes

the minimum funding standard (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or
Sections 412 and 430 of the Code), in each case whether or not waived. All
contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Plan on or
before the date hereof have been made and all obligations in respect of each
Company Plan as of the date hereof have been accrued and reflected in the

IV Company Plan which is a single-employer plan, the financial statements
filed with the Form 5500 most recently filed with the Internal Revenue

fairly presented the financial condition of such Company Plan in all material
respects as of the last day of the plan year covered by such Form 5500,

other than for claims for expenses actually incurred prior to the date of such
amendment, modification or termination, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any current or projected liability in respect

benefits for current, former, or retired employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

4001(a)(3) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV Company Plan a plan described in
Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

(vii) There is no present intention that any Company Plan be materially
amended, suspended, or terminated, or otherwise modified to adversely change

twelve (12) months immediately following the date hereof. Each Company Plan
has been established, operated, and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. As
of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company threatened, litigation relating to the Company Plans. No transaction
has occurred with respect to any Company Plan that, assuming the taxable
period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to
incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA or any liability under Section 4071 of ERISA, in any such case, in an
amount which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(viii) Each Company Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code has received an affirmative determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service as to its qualification. No event has
occurred, whether by action or failure to act, and no conditions or
circumstances exist, that could be reasonably likely to result in the loss of
the qualification of such Company Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. For
each Company Plan with respect to which a Form 5500 has been filed, no
material change has occurred with respect to the matters covered by the most
recent Form since the date thereof.



 

-22- (ix) There are no pending, or threatened, claims by or on behalf of
any Company Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any Company
Plan, or otherwise involving any Company Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits). No facts or circumstances exist that could be reasonably likely to
give rise to any such actions, suits or claims. No written or oral
communication has been received from the PBGC in respect of any Company Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA concerning the funded status of any such plan or
any transfer of assets and liabilities from any such plan in connection with
the transactions contemplated herein. With respect to the Company Plans, the
Company has not been notified (in writing or otherwise) of any pending,
threatened or in progress administrative investigation, audit, or
other administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the
Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agencies (including any routine
requests for information from the PBGC), and to the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no such pending, threatened or in progress investigations, audits
or proceedings.

(x) Except as expressly described on Section 5.1(h)(x) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no Company Plan exists that, as a result of the execution
of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any
subsequent event(s)), could (A) entitle any Company Employee to severance pay
or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the
date of this Agreement, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Plans, (C) limit
or restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the
Company Plans, (D) cause the Company to record additional compensation expense
on its income statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other

which would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. No Company Plan
provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or
otherwise. All Company Stock Options can be cancelled by their terms without
any payment therefor in accordance with Section 4.3(a).

have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans and cost-
related plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and
Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-related
plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans), and that Parent and Merger
Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
of their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
advisors, agents or representatives, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, has made or is
making any 



 

-41-  representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements, business plans or cost-related plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements, business plans or cost-
related plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.2(p)
or this Agreement shall (i) relieve any Person of liability for fraud, (ii)
prevent Parent and Merger Sub from relying on the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, any certificates
delivered by the Company in connection with this Agreement or (iii) be given

bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives
(collectively, " _ _Representatives__ ") shall have the right to: (i)
initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposals or
offers that constitute Acquisition Proposals, including by way of providing
access to non-public information to any Person pursuant to confidentiality
agreements on customary terms not more favorable in any material respect to
such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreements need not prohibit the making
or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal to the extent such Acquisition
Proposal is made directly to the Company); _provided_ that the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) make available to
Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any Person given

financing of such group at all times following the No-Shop Period Start Date

received (x) prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, an Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor)
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, and (y) by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on the 5th
business day after the date of expiration of the Go-Shop Period, a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal,

 

(any such Person or group of Persons, an " _ _Excluded Party__ "; _provided_
that any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes
under this Agreement at such time as the Acquisition Proposal made by such
Person or group of Persons fails to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
agreed and understood that an Acquisition Proposal will not fail to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such Acquisition Proposal is amended,
modified or revised during the course of ongoing negotiations with the Company
as a result of the exercise by Parent of its rights pursuant to Section
6.2(e), which exercise renders such Acquisition Proposal no longer to be a
Superior Proposal, so long as such negotiations are ongoing and it
subsequently constitutes a Superior Proposal))

 

the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors
shall, and the Company shall instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries
other Representatives to, (i) at 12:00 a.m. on the 41st calendar day after the

otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
provide any non-public information or data concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, (C) enter
into any agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c)) or (D) otherwise knowingly facilitate any
effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the last sentence of this
paragraph, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that did not result from a material breach of
Section 6.2(b), the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its
Representatives may provide non-public



 

-49-  information and data concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in response
to a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from such Person
an executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms not more favorable
to such Person in any material respect than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of an
Acquisition Proposal to the extent such Acquisition Proposal is made directly
to the Company); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the
Company made available to any Person given such access which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) the Company and its
Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person and (iii) after having complied with Section 6.2(e), the
Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may authorize,
adopt, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to
authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Board
of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such
action could be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (y) in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
above, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (iii) above, the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. For
the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in
Section 6.2(a) with respect to any Excluded Parties, including with respect to
any amended proposal submitted by any Excluded Parties following the No-Shop
Period Start Date, and the restrictions in Section 6.2(b) shall not apply
with respect thereto; _provided_ that the provisions of Section 6.2(e) shall
apply.

involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or (ii) any

transactions, (A) more than 20% of the Shares then outstanding or the total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company, (B) assets that during

-50-  measured either by book value or fair market value (including, equity
securities of its Subsidiaries), of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as

Agreement.

(ii) " _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an Acquisition Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%),
that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof has
determined in its good faith judgment (i) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all material
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal (including the
financing thereof) and the Person making the proposal, and (ii) if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys

take no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of
business as of the tenth (10th) business day after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without
such action being considered an adverse modification); or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(c)) (an " _
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board
of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof may withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or
otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith is
a Superior Proposal made after the date hereof, if the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a " _
_Change of Recommendation__ ") and may also take action pursuant to Section
8.3(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior 



 

-51-  Proposal or take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a

Proposal; (y) after providing such notice and prior to making such Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or taking any action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such ninety-six (96)
hour period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment or
the Guaranty as would permit the Board of Directors of the Company not to
effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or
to take such action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in response to a Superior
Proposal; and (z) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered
in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment
and the Guaranty offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall have determined in good
faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not effect a
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or take any
action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal prior to
the time that is ninety-six (96) hours after it has provided the written
notice required by clause (x) above; _provided_ _further_ , that in the event
that the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this Section
6.2(e), except that the Companys advance written notice obligation shall be
reduced to forty-eight (48) hours (rather than the ninety-six (96) hours
otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.2(e)) and the time the Company shall
be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to
a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the time that is forty-eight (48)
hours after it has provided such written notice (rather than the time that is
the ninety-six (96) hours otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.2(e)) (but
in no event prior to the original ninety-six (96) hour advance notice
period).

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company (or
any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the Company
stockholders tender any



 

-52-  securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case,
in connection therewith, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) effects
a Change in Recommendation; _provided_ _further_ that any such disclosure
(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be an Change in Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the
Company expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation at least two (2)
business days prior to the Stockholders Meeting.

 

(g) _Notice_. Within 24 hours following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall notify Parent of the identity of each Person or group of
Persons that has made an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof has determined in good faith (after

Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.
Within 24 hours following the expiration of the five business day period after
the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall notify Parent of the identity
of each Person or group of Persons that the Company considers to be an

after the date hereof, any Acquisition Proposals are received by the Company
and (ii) from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, any non-public
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought

the case of both clauses (i) and (ii) above, will, in connection with such
notice, identify the Person or group of Persons making the offer or the
proposal or seeking such information or discussions or negotiations and

proposals or offers that are not made in writing and copies of any requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, of proposals or offers

thereto or any change to the terms or conditions thereof) and the status of
any discussions or negotiations. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

6.3. _Proxy Filings; Information Supplied_. The Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC as promptly as practicable following the date of this

stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, (i)
the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the

  

 

-53-  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger
Sub agree that none of the information supplied by either of them or any of
their Affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company
shall provide NRG with respect to the matters relating to NRG or the NRG Sale
an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and shall consider
in good faith any comments reasonably proposed by NRG with respect to the
matters relating to NRG or the NRG Sale.

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law, the Company will take, in accordance with applicable
Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all reasonable action
necessary to call, give notice of and convene a meeting of Record Holders of
Shares (the " _ _Stockholders Meeting__ ") as promptly as practicable after
the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon the
adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting, but no
longer than reasonably necessary, (i) with the consent of Parent; (ii) for the
absence of a quorum; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting; (iv) if required by Law; or
(v) if the Company has provided a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 6.2(e) that it intends to take action pursuant to Section

Section 6.2(e) with respect to such notice has not been reached. Subject to
Section 6.2, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend such
adoption, shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with, Article VIII,

respect to the matters relating to NRG or the NRG Sale) of the receipt of all
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request

Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC staff
advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may

be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the seventh business day
following the No-Shop Period Start Date. To the extent required by applicable
Law in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Company shall, as promptly

the Company any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement if any event
shall occur which requires such action at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting.

 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders, and,
with respect to Parent, NRG, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to any third party

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the NRG Sale, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Affiliates, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, the
NRG Sale and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its Affiliates, officers or any
other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings with, investigation or other inquiry by such
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, the NRG Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or by the NRG PSA unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party (either directly or through one of
its Representatives) the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(d) _Required Approval Matters_. Without limiting the generality of the other
undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.5 and subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company (in the case of clauses (i),
(ii), (iii)(A) and (iv) of this Section 6.5(d) set forth below) and Parent
(in all cases set forth below) agrees to take or cause to be taken the
following actions:

 

(i) to cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all



 

-55-  actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Article VII and to consummate and make effective
the Merger, the NRG Sale and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable, including, with respect to Parent,
specifically enforcing its rights under the NRG PSA, and preparing and filing
as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Merger, the NRG Sale or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the NRG PSA, including under
the HSR Act, the FPA and the New York Public Service Law. In furtherance of
and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company each shall file
the initial pre-merger notifications with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein required, and Parent shall, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause NRG, to file the initial pre-merger
notification with respect to the NRG PSA, the NRG Sale and the transactions
contemplated therein, in each case, under the HSR Act (which filing,
including the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to
the other party except to outside counsel of each party), the FPA and the New
York Public Service Law, in each case, as promptly as practicable after the

termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act
and any other applicable Antitrust Law. Parent will, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause NRG, to request early termination of the
waiting period with respect to the NRG Sale under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law. The Company will provide information necessary for Parent to
complete its pre-merger notification under the HSR Act with respect to the NRG
Sale and and an officer or director of the Company will certify in Parents
pre-merger notification that the information provided is accurate as
required under HSR Rule 803.6. Parent will not, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause NRG not to, withdraw its initial filing under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be, with respect to the Merger
or the NRG Sale and refile it unless the Company has consented in advance to
such withdrawal and refiling. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on
and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, the NRG Sale and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement but subject
to Section 6.5(a)). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company
and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take or agree
to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon Closing. For



 

-56-  purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Antitrust Law__ " means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other
Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition;

 

(ii) to provide promptly to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over any Company Required
Governmental Approval, Parent Required Governmental Approval, the approvals
required to consummate the NRG Sale as set forth in Section 7.2(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _ _NRG Sale Approvals__ ") or otherwise over

_Governmental Approval Entity__ ") such non-privileged information and
documents as reasonably requested by any such Governmental Approval Entity or
that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the NRG PSA;

 

(iii) to use its reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain promptly all Company
Required Governmental Approvals, Parent Required Governmental Approvals and
NRG Sale Approvals and (B) avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision,
determination, judgment, investigation or Law that would delay in any
material respect, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the NRG PSA, including
the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect
the sale, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets
or businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with,
and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Approval Entity giving
effect thereto) if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any investigation or proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance
or enactment of any order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that would delay in any material respect, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger, the NRG Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Approval Entity;

 

(iv) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the
consummation of the NRG Sale in accordance with the NRG PSA unlawful or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the Merger, the NRG Sale or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the NRG PSA, to use its reasonable best efforts to



 

-57-  take any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond
or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (iii) of this Section
6.5(d)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement or the NRG PSA, as the case may be; and

(v) to refrain from entering into any agreement, arrangement or other
understanding to acquire any assets or properties that would reasonably be
expected to (i) prevent or materially delay receipt of any Company Required
Governmental Approvals, Parent Required Governmental Approvals or the NRG
Sale Approvals or (ii) prevent or materially delay the Closing or the
consummation of the NRG Sale.

 

(e) _Planning Committee_. Promptly following the date hereof (but in any event
within five (5) calendar days after the date of this Agreement), each of the
Company and Parent shall, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause NRG to, appoint two (2) representatives to a regulatory and transition
planning committee (the " _ _Committee__ "). The Committee shall meet by
telephone or in person weekly (with at least one representative from each of
the Company, Parent and NRG present), to discuss the status of all notices,
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations made or sought
by Parent, the Company and NRG which are necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Merger, the NRG Sale and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by the NRG PSA, including under the HSR Act, the FPA, the NYPSC,
the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent
System Operator.

 

6.6. _Access and Reports_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable prior written notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers
and other Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period from the date hereof and though the Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, facilities, books, contracts and records
and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties, facilities, operations and personnel as may reasonably be
requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall affect or be deemed to modify or supplement any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to furnish such information in a manner that
does not result in any such disclosure, including obtaining the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or



 

-58-  any of its Subsidiaries if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in the
loss of such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall be directed to a Person designated by the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party and its Representatives
(each as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) may furnish Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) after the No-Shop
Period Start Date to any Person in connection with such Persons (A)
potential investment in Parent or its Affiliates or (B) evaluation of the
acquisition of assets of the Company in connection with or following the
Closing (the actions contemplated by the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), other
than in connection with the NRG Sale, a " _ _Third Party Investment__ "),
provided, that Parent shall have directed such Person to treat any Evaluation
Material provided to such Person in accordance with the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and to perform or to comply with
the obligations of the Receiving Party with respect to any such Evaluation
Material as contemplated by the Confidentiality Agreement. Parent agrees that
it will be fully responsible for any breach of any of the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement by any such Person as though it were a
"Representative" under the Confidentiality Agreement. In connection with a
Third Party Investment, the Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, all reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement or consummation of a Third
Party Investment as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including with
respect to any customary due diligence review of such assets that may be
requested by Parent such as visits of properties and facilities of the Company
and meeting with appropriate personnel of the Company (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries). Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of any Third Party
Investment (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.6)
and any information utilized in connection therewith. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that any Third Party Investment is not a condition to
Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of any Third Party Investment, subject to fulfillment or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VII.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing Section 6.6(a), at
any time and from time to time after the date hereof, the Company will allow
Parent and its representatives reasonable access to the Derivative Products
trading operations of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and the Company
Joint Ventures and their respective books and records, and
develop appropriate procedures to permit Parent and its approved
Representatives (such approval by the Company not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) to monitor the aggregate net positions in the
Derivative Products trading portfolio of the Company,



 

-59-  the Company Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures, subject to the other
terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
applicable Laws. Parent shall have the right to appoint an individual who, in
addition to exercising any of the rights granted to Parent pursuant to Section
6.6(a) and the preceding sentence of this Section 6.6(b), shall also have the
rights, and be subject to the limitations, set forth on Section 6.6(b) of the

releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making
any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect

listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity.

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of the

Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time (" _ _Affected Employees__ ") will be provided, unless their employment
has ceased, with total annual cash compensation opportunities and benefits
that, taken together, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
total annual cash compensation opportunities and benefits provided by the

any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to comply with the provisions of
each of the Companys change in control severance plans.

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans which the Affected

eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder (other than any benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan), service for the Company and
its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such
service was credited under the comparable plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits). Parent shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to 



 

-60-  participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Affected Employee
under any welfare benefit plan in which an Affected Employee is eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the extent such limitations,
conditions, and waiting periods were satisfied or inapplicable under the
comparable welfare benefit plan and (ii) credit each Affected Employee for any
co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the
Effective Time under the terms of any corresponding Company Plan in satisfying
any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements for the

plan in which the Affected Employee participates on and after the Effective
Time.

(c) For all Affected Employees who continue employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation through
the earlier of March 15, 2011 (such Affected Employees, the " _ _Continuing
Employees_ ")_, and the date on which Parent otherwise pays annual bonuses
and incentive payments to similarly situated employees (the " _ _2011 Bonus
Payment Date__ "), bonuses and incentive payments shall be paid to such
Continuing Employees on the 2011 Bonus Payment Date in accordance with the
bonus and incentive plans or programs of Parent; _provided_ that Parent shall
ensure that the aggregate annual bonuses and incentive payments made to all
Continuing Employees, measured as a group, in respect of the 2010 calendar
year are no less than the aggregate amount accrued therefor as of December 31,
2010 for such Continuing Employees.

Section 409A of the Code.

 

(e) Parent hereby acknowledges and recognizes that, as of the Effective Time,
all of the Companys and/or the Companys Affiliates contractual obligations
with the unions representing bargaining unit employees of the Company or its
Affiliates will continue, including all contractual obligations under
applicable collective bargaining agreements, as listed in Section 6.9(e) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to future bargaining between the unions
and the Company or the Companys Affiliates).

 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (but no
later than fifteen (15) calendar days and prior to the Closing), the Company
shall take the actions described in Section 6.9(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Company Plan, (ii) give any third
party (including any employee or dependent or beneficiary of any employee or
trustee) any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9 or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to
retain the employment of any particular employee for any period of time or to
maintain any particular Company Plan or benefit, except to the extent
otherwise required by Section 6.9(c) with respect to the bonuses and incentive
payments.



 

-61- (h) At the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with a true and complete
list of Business Employee (as that term is defined in the NRG PSA)
terminations, by date and location, implemented by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company in the 90-day period prior to the Closing.

 

6.10. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except for Parents reimbursement and indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 6.6 and Section 6.14.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving

or services performed by such persons at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, in connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party.

rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _ _D andO Insurance__") with terms, conditions,

reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions

successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation

rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to

appeal such decision, (ii) upon the date the Company initiated the action
referred to in clause (i), the Company could have terminated this Agreement

pursuant to Section 8.3(b), the breach of the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty,
shall have contributed materially to the failure of the Closing to have
occurred unless a breach by NRG of any of its obligations under the NRG PSA
shall have been the proximate cause of the failure of the Closing to
have occurred) and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub are not willing to consummate
the Merger in accordance with this Agreement within eleven (11) calendar days
of the earlier of such decision becoming final and non-appealable or the
Company irrevocably agreeing to waive, and not pursue, any rights it may have
to appeal such decision, then Parent shall pay the Company as liquidated
damages an amount equal to $100 million (the " _ _Parent Fee__ ") less any
amounts previously paid by, or on behalf of, Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 6.6 or Section 6.14 of this Agreement, which Parent shall promptly,
but in no event later than eleven (11) calendar days after the earlier of the
date such decision becomes final or non-appealable or the date the Company
irrevocably agrees to waive, and not to pursue, any rights it may have to
appeal such a decision, pay or cause to be paid to the Company by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (it being understood that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Fee on more than one occasion) and
upon such payment this Agreement shall terminate. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that, prior to the Closing of the NRG PSA, the sole and exclusive
remedy of any party thereunder is specific performance. Parent and Merger Sub
agree that if (A) the NRG PSA is terminated, or the NRG Sale is not
consummated, for any reason, (B) the Merger Agreement is terminated, or the
Merger is not consummated, for any reason and (C) Merger Sub or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and NRG or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, and notwithstanding that specific performance is the exclusive remedy,
enter into any settlement, termination or similar negotiated agreement in
which Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates receives any payment (whether in
cash, assets, properties or otherwise) from NRG or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the termination of the NRG PSA or the failure of the NRG Sale
to be consummated (but not including any payments received pursuant to section
9.2(b) of the NRG PSA), then, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, pay to the Company fifty percent (50%) of the value of such amounts
paid by NRG or any of its Affiliates (such amount, an " _ _NRG Payment__ ").

 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.5 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(c) or Parent fails to promptly pay
the amounts due pursuant to Section 8.5(d), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a suit

 



 

-72-  that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in
Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof or a judgment against
Parent for the amounts set forth in Section 8.5(d) or any portion thereof,
the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent
shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Companys
receipt and acceptance of the Parent Fee and NRG Payment, if any, pursuant to
this Section 8.5 (plus, in the case the Parent Fee or the NRG Payment, if any,
is not timely paid, the amounts described in the first sentence of this
Section 8.5(e)) and the Companys receipt and acceptance of the reimbursement
and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 6.6 and Section
6.14 shall, subject to Section 9.5(c), be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor and
any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or
agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
and upon payment of such amounts, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or
any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) Parents receipt of the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, as the
case may be, from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5 (plus, in the case
the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses is not timely paid, the amounts
described in the first sentence of this Section 8.5(e)) shall, subject to
Section 9.5(c), be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor and their respective Affiliates against the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members,
Affiliates or agents for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

shall survive the consummation of the Merger. This Article IX and the
agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 6.10

Confidentiality Agreement and the Guaranty shall survive the termination of
this Agreement (in 



 

-73-  the case of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guaranty, subject to the
terms thereof). All other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the Merger
or the termination of this Agreement.

9.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the applicable
Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify
or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties; _provided_  that this
Agreement may not be modified or amended by the parties hereto in a manner
adverse to NRG as a third party beneficiary hereunder as set forth in Section
9.8 in any material respect, including any modification or amendment that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger, the NRG PSA or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the NRG PSA, without NRGs prior written consent.

 

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws; _provided_ that no such waiver shall be effective without
NRGs prior written consent if such waiver would be adverse to NRG as a third
party beneficiary hereunder as set forth in Section 9.8 in any material
respect, including any such waiver that would prevent, impair or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger, the NRG PSA or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the NRG PSA.

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same agreement.

 

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent
such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (the " _ _Chosen Courts__ ") solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that this



 

-74-  Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen
Courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to
such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen
Courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen Court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing
of process or other papers in connection with any such action, suit or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by law shall be valid, effective and sufficient service
thereof.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.5.

 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement or the NRG PSA) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree
that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy, subject to Section 9.5(d), to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Parent and Merger Sub further acknowledge and
agree that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the NRG PSA and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the NRG PSA, this being in
addition to any other remedy, subject to Section 9.5(d), to which the Company
is entitled at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby
further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall
be entitled to seek specific performance (i) to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of Section 6.5 by
Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) to enforce specifically the terms and 



 

-75-  provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the NRG PSA by Merger Sub
or NRG and (iii) if (A) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing)
have been satisfied and (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing
by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2,
to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to draw down the full proceeds of the
Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Financing
Commitment and to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) under no circumstances will the
Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess of (A) any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 8.5(d), (B) any reimbursement obligation of Parent
pursuant to the first sentence of Section 8.5(e) and (C) the reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Parent contained in Section 6.6 and Section
6.14 and (2) under no circumstances will Parent be entitled to monetary
damages in excess of (A) the amount of the Termination Fee and (B) any
reimbursement obligations of the Company pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 8.5(e). Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

(d) Except as provided in Section 8.5(d), the Company hereby agrees that
specific performance provided by Section 9.5(c) shall be its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available
for breach under this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment or the
Guaranty or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including monetary damages) other than any amounts owing
to the Company pursuant to the reimbursement and indemnification obligations
of Parent contained in Section 6.6 and Section 6.14.

 

(e) The Company further agrees that (x) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in Section 9.5(c) by Parent or Merger Sub shall not in any respect
constitute a waiver by either Parent or Merger Sub of its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to either of them under this
Agreement, including under Section 8.5, in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in Section
9.5(c) are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set
forth in this Agreement shall require Parent or Merger Sub to institute
any proceeding for (or limit Parents or Merger Subs right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under Section 9.5(c) prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and pursuing
damages after



 

-76-  such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding
pursuant to Section 9.5(c) or anything set forth in this Section 9.5(e)
restrict or limit Parents or Merger Subs right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

9.6. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 28, 2010, between Blackstone Management
Partners L.L.C. and the Company (the " _ _Confidentiality Agreement__ "), the
Guaranty and the third party beneficiary rights of the Company under the NRG
PSA and the Equity Financing Commitment constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN THE GUARANTY,
NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE NRG PSA, THE GUARANTY OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR BY THE NRG PSA, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF
ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING.

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), (ii) only with respect
to stockholders and only after the Effective Time, for the provisions set
forth in Article IV, (iii) as provided in Section 8.5(e), each of the Persons
whose liability is limited in accordance with Section 8.5(e) to the extent
provided therein and (iv) for NRG, who is an intended third party
beneficiary of, and shall have the right only to specifically enforce (and
not any right to obtain monetary or other damages of any kind) the rights and
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, in each case, to the extent
such rights and obligations directly relate to the "Companies", the "Company
Subsidiaries", the "Interests", the "Business", the "Assumed Liabilities" and
the "Specified Assets", as such terms are defined in the NRG PSA (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the access provisions in Section 6.6 herein) and
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, Parent and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set 



 

-78-  forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary

an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation when due.

9.11.  _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be



 

-79-  deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." All pronouns and all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer
to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of
the Person may require. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any
agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such
references are to, except as context may otherwise require, the agreement,
contract, statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated
or replaced from time to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to
the extent permitted by the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute
or regulation including any successor to the section and, in the case of any
statute, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. All references
to "dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.14.  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise without the written consent of the other parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a
Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary,
except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of
such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall not impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
is void.



 

-80- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.

or as of such date the last of the conditions precedent to the Closing set
forth in Article VII of this Agreement (other than the Merger Closing and
those other conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) shall
have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by
the Party for whose benefit such conditions precedent exist, or at such
other date, time and location as may be agreed upon in writing between Buyer
and Seller. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter
called the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall be effective for all purposes
as of the "Effective Time" as defined in the Merger Agreement.

Purchase Price_ "), without deduction or withholding of any kind, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars to such account or

Loss prior to Closing, the Base Price shall be reduced by $275 million, or
(ii) if prior to Closing there has occurred any uncured damage or destruction

restoring the Casco Bay Station to a condition reasonably comparable to their
condition prior to such casualty (as estimated by a qualified engineering firm
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller) after giving effect to any
insurance proceeds available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
pursuant to Section 6.11) and any Tax benefits available to Buyer or its
Affiliates in respect thereto, up to a maximum reduction of $50 million.

 

(d) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide to Buyer a worksheet setting forth its good faith reasonable estimate

(c) Such other agreements, documents, instruments and writings as are
reasonably required to be delivered by Buyer at or prior to the Closing Date

2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Buyer agree to allocate the
Purchase Price (and all other capitalizable costs) among the Interests (and
all assets owned by the Companies) and the Specified Assets for all Tax
purposes in accordance with an allocation schedule (the " _Allocation
Schedule_ ") prepared by Seller within 120 days after the Closing Date, such
Allocation Schedule subject to Buyers review and consent and prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder; provided, however, that in the event that Seller and Buyer cannot
reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30)
days after Seller provides the Allocation Schedule to Buyer, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall resolve any disputed portion of the Allocation Schedule.
The costs related to having the Independent Accounting Firm resolve disputes
relating to the Allocation Schedule shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. Seller and Buyer agree to file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns in
respect of the Interests and the Specified Assets in a manner consistent with
the Allocation Schedule and to take no position for Tax purposes inconsistent
with the Allocation Schedule, in each case unless required otherwise by a
final determination of a competent taxing authority.

2.6 _Post Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller (i) a balance sheet showing the Working Capital as of the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), and (ii) a certificate setting forth
(a) the Closing Date Working Capital (calculated in accordance with the
Closing Date Balance Sheet) and (b) the amount by which the



 

14  Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds, or is exceeded by, the Closing
Date Working Capital. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with GAAP. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared
in accordance with this Agreement by making appropriate adjustments to the
items specified in _Schedule 1.1(109)_ , while maintaining consistency with
the principles and methodologies as were used in preparing  _Schedule
1.1(109)_.

(b) Buyers determination of Closing Date Working Capital shall become final
and binding on the Parties thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet by Buyer unless Seller objects in good faith to Buyers
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and calculation of the Closing
Date Working Capital in writing, stating in reasonable detail their objection
thereto (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). Following delivery of the Notice
of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate to exchange information
used to prepare the Estimated Closing Working Capital, Closing Date Working
Capital and the Notice of Disagreement. To the extent any portion of the
calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital is not objected to in the
Notice of Disagreement, such items portion shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Seller. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any objections noted in the Notice of Disagreement, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall each submit such remaining disputes to
the Independent Accounting Firm in a revised Notice of Disagreement which
details the remaining outstanding disputes. Seller and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to resolve
all disputes as soon as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Independent Accountant shall be instructed to resolve all such disputes within
thirty (30) days after the submission of the disputes to such Independent
Accountant. The resolution of the disputes by the Independent Accountant shall
be final, binding on, conclusive and non-appealable by the Parties. The costs
and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between Buyer
and Seller in proportion to the relative difference between (a) the Closing
Date Working Capital calculated by Seller, as adjusted for the resolution of
any disputes between the Parties prior to the engagement of the Independent
Accountant and (b) the Closing Date Working Capital as finally determined by
the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant will only consider
those items and amounts set forth in the revised Notice of Disagreement
submitted by either Party. The Independent Accountant shall make its
determination based solely on presentations and supporting material provided
by the Parties and not pursuant to any independent review, nor shall
the Independent Accountant allow the Parties to conduct any discovery. In
resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accountant may not assign any
value to a disputed item greater than the greatest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party or lesser than lowest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party.

(c) If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than the Closing Date
Working Capital which has become final and binding on the Parties pursuant to
Section 2.6(b), Seller shall, within 5 days of the Closing Date Working
Capital becoming final and binding, make payment by wire transfer to Buyer,
in immediately available funds in the amount of such difference, together with
interest thereon at a rate of 2% per annum from the Closing Date to the date
of payment.

 

(d) If the Closing Date Working Capital which has become final and binding on
the Parties pursuant to Section 2.6(b) is greater than the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, Buyer shall, within 5 days of the Closing Date Working
Capital becoming final and binding,

 



 

15  make payment by wire transfer to Seller, in immediately available funds in
the amount of such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate of 2%
per annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

Affiliates, Dynegy or any of its Affiliates is required to keep confidential
or prevent access to by reason of any contract or agreement with a third
party, provided that such entity has sought a waiver from such third party.



 

23 (b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date (or if the
Closing does not occur, from the date hereof) all nonpublic information in
any form or medium, written or oral, concerning Dynegy and its Affiliates
and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Merger Agreement

its Affiliates Representatives who reasonably require access to such
nonpublic information in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (so long as Buyer remains liable hereunder for any breach of this
provision by any such Representative), and shall be used solely for the
purpose of achieving the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing herein shall prevent Buyer from sharing such information with

confidential nature of such information and agree to keep such information
confidential. In the event this Agreement is terminated as provided in
Article IX hereof, Buyer shall return or destroy all such nonpublic
information to Seller provided that neither such return nor such destruction
shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Section 6.1. From and after
the Closing, the confidentiality provisions of this Section 6.1(b) shall not
apply to Buyer with respect any such information to the extent that it relates
to the Business, the Companies or the Specified Assets. For a period of two

hereunder for any breach of this provision by any such Representative); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may disclose such information related to
the period prior to the Closing in connection with any financial reporting,
compliance with any requirements of Law or Order and for tax purposes.
This Section 6.1(b) shall not apply to any information, documents or
materials which are in the public domain or shall come into the public domain,
other than by reason of a breach by either Party of their obligations
hereunder. Furthermore, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict
either Party from disclosing any information (i) in any action or proceeding
by such party to enforce any rights it may have against the other Party; (ii)
in connection with any interrogatories, requests for information or other
documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demands, or any
other similar process; and (iii) in connection with routine audits or
examinations by, or a blanket document request from, a regulatory or self-
regulatory authority, bank examiner or auditor.

Tax Returns and to prepare for and participate in any investigation with
respect thereto, to prepare for and participate in any other investigation and

24  relating to or involving such Party or its Affiliates, to discharge its
obligations under this Agreement, to comply with financial reporting
requirements, and for other reasonable purposes, and will afford such Party
and its Affiliates reasonable assistance in connection therewith. Each Party
will cause such records to be maintained for not less than seven (7) years
from the Closing Date and will not dispose of such records without first
offering in writing to deliver them to the other Party; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event that Buyer transfers all or a portion of the business of
the Companies or the Specified Assets to any third party during such
period, Buyer may transfer to such third party all or a portion of the books,
records, files and documents related thereof, provided such third party
transferee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of Buyer under this
Section 6.1(c). In addition, on and after the Closing Date, at either Partys
request, the other Party shall make available to the requesting Party and its
Affiliates and Representatives those employees of the other Party requested by
such Party in connection with any proceeding, including to provide testimony,
to be deposed, to act as witnesses and to assist counsel; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) such access to such employees shall not unreasonably
interfere with the normal conduct of the operations of the other Party and
(ii) the requesting Party shall reimburse the other Party for the out-of-
pocket costs reasonably incurred by such Party in making such employees
available to the requesting Party and its Affiliates and Representatives.

(d) As of the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain

by the request of any Governmental Authority.

6.3 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Seller shall cause

taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the purchase and sale of the Interests and the Specified Assets pursuant to
this Agreement and the assignment and assumption of the Specified Assets,
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure satisfaction of
the conditions precedent to each Partys obligations hereunder, including
obtaining all necessary Consents, and making all required Filings with, third
parties required to be obtained or made in order to consummate the
transactions hereunder; _provided_   _that_ , Buyer agrees and acknowledges
that Sellers obligations under this Section 6.3 to cause Dynegy to take any
actions are expressly subject to and limited by Sellers rights to cause

during the eighteen (18) months after Closing, (i) there are Liabilities of
the Companies that are Excluded Liabilities, Seller shall promptly assume such
Liabilities; (ii) Seller or its Affiliates own assets primarily related to
the Business, Seller promptly shall transfer such assets to Buyer,



 

25  each as part of the transaction under this Agreement; provided that, such
18-month period shall be extended to complete any such assumption or transfer
for which notice of the obligation to effect such assumption or transfer was
provided by one Party to the other with reasonable specificity on or prior to
the expiration of such 18-month period. If, at any time during the eighteen
(18) months after Closing, (i) there are Assumed Liabilities or Liabilities
of any Non-DPG Affiliate that are primarily related to the Business, Buyer
shall promptly assume such Liabilities ( _provided_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, Buyer shall not be required to assume any Excluded Liabilities
listed on _Schedule 1.1(46_ )); (ii) Buyer or its Affiliates, including the
Companies, own any assets acquired through the acquisition of the Interests or
the Specified Assets that are not primarily related to the Business, Buyer
shall promptly transfer such assets (other than any assets listed on _Schedule

provided that, such 18-month period shall be extended to complete any
such assumption or transfer for which notice of the obligation to effect such
assumption or transfer was provided by one Party to the other with reasonable
specificity on or prior to the expiration of such 18-month period.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
have the right to cause the Companies to pay cash dividends, make cash
distributions and assign accounts receivable to Seller or its Affiliates at
any time prior to the Closing. From and after the Closing, any accounts
receivable for goods sold, or services performed, prior to the Closing that
have been assigned to Seller or any Non-DPG Affiliate prior to the Closing
and not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement will be for the account
of Seller (and shall not be included in the Estimated Closing Working Capital
or Closing Date Working Capital). In addition, from and after the Closing (i)
any accounts receivable (including any account receivable relating to any
Specified Asset that is a current asset) or accounts payable (including any
account payable that would otherwise be an Assumed Liability and is a current
liability) of any Non-DPG Affiliate (whether or not related to the Business),
and (ii) any accounts receivable (including any account receivable of any of
the Companies and is a current asset) or accounts payable (including any
account payable that would otherwise be an Assumed Liability and is a current
liability) of any of the Companies, in each case (x) for goods purchased, or
services performed prior to the Closing, and (y) to the extent not taken into
consideration in the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital, shall be
considered to be the assets and liabilities of and for the account of the
Seller and the applicable Non-DPG Affiliates, and thus from and
after Closing, Buyer shall promptly remit to Seller any amounts received by
Buyer or any of the Companies or their Affiliates in connection with such
accounts receivable, and Seller shall be responsible for the prompt payment
when due of such accounts payable.

required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, as amended, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall supply as promptly as practicable

waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Buyer and Seller
shall comply substantially with any additional requests for information,
including requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions, made by any Antitrust Authority and take all other
reasonable actions to obtain clearance from the Antitrust Authorities. Buyer
shall exercise its reasonable best efforts, and Seller shall cooperate fully
with Buyer, to prevent the entry in any proceeding brought by an Antitrust
Authority or any Governmental Authority of an Order that would prohibit, make
unlawful or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nonetheless, if such Order is entered, the Parties shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to) use reasonable best efforts to have
any such Order lifted. Buyer shall pay all filing fees payable under the HSR
Act but each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses of the preparation of
any such Filing and any such response.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to obtain all required Consents of
all other Governmental Authorities, and make all other Filings required to be
made prior to the Closing with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, including with respect to the Sellers Required Regulatory Approvals
and Buyers Required Regulatory Approvals. Each Party shall bear its own costs
and expenses of the preparation of any such Filing. Buyer and Seller will
diligently pursue and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such
Consents and will cooperate with each other in seeking such Consents. To such
end, the Parties agree to make available the personnel and other resources of
their respective organizations in order to obtain all such Consents. Each
Party will promptly inform the other Party of any material communication
received by such Party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Authority from which any such Consent is required and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(unless prohibited by Law or by such Governmental Authority), and will permit
the other Party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any such Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with such
other Person, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or
other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and to
participate in such meetings and conferences. Nothing in this Section 6.4(b)
shall require disclosure to the other Party of information that is treated as
confidential business information or otherwise subject to a third party
confidentiality obligation.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.4(b), as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, each Party shall make all Filings required by such Party
under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. Prior to filing any application
with the FERC, both Parties shall prepare such application and
shall incorporate into such application all revisions reasonably requested by
the other Party. Each Party shall be solely responsible for its own cost of
preparing and filing such application, as well as all petitions for rehearing
and all reapplications, provided, however, that Buyer shall bear all costs
and expenses associated with experts and consultants reasonably necessary for
the preparation of any required market power study or report. If any required
approval is denied by 



 

27  the FERC, the Parties shall petition the FERC for rehearing or permission to
re-submit an application with the FERC.

 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing and except as set forth on _Schedule
6.4(d)_ , required actions by Buyer shall include, but not be limited to,
acceptance by Buyer of divestitures of any subsidiary or assets of Buyer or
its Affiliates, acceptance by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any limitation
on or condition on the manner in which Buyer or any of its Affiliates
conduct their business, or acceptance of an agreement to hold any assets of
Buyer or its Affiliates separate in any lawsuit or other legal proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative and whether required by any applicable
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees that except as may be agreed in writing by Seller, Buyer
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) (a) acquire, or enter into
an agreement to acquire, any electric generation, transmission
or distribution facilities, electric generation projects or "inputs to
electric power production" (as defined in 18 C.F.R. 35.36(a)(4)), or any
entity owning, operating or otherwise controlling such facilities, projects or
inputs; or (b) initiate development or enter into an agreement to develop any
new electric generation projects, to the extent such actions described in (a)
or (b) above would reasonably be expected to prevent the Parties from securing
all required Filings or Consents with or from any Governmental Authority to
consummate the transactions hereunder (after giving effect to any agreement or
commitment in accordance with Section 6.4(d)) or would reasonably be expected
to materially delay such Filings or Consents; provided that, other than its
obligations under Section 6.4(d), Buyer shall not be prohibited from
continuing any existing development activities.

 

(f) Promptly following the date hereof (but in any event within five (5)
calendar days of this Agreement), each of the Buyer and Seller shall, and
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Dynegy to, appoint two
(2) representatives to a regulatory and transition planning committee (the "
_Committee_ "). The Committee shall meet by telephone or in person weekly
(with at least one representative from each of Seller, Buyer and Dynegy
present), to discuss the status of all notices, consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations, made or sought by Seller, Buyer and
Dynegy which are necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Merger Agreement
Closing, the Closing and any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by the Merger Agreement, including under the HSR Act or the
Federal Power Act, or from any of the New York State Public Service
Commission, the California Independent System Operator Corporation and the
California Public Utilities Commission.

 

6.5 _Assignment_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.5(b) and Section 6.5(c) and pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, (i) the Seller and its Affiliates will agree to transfer and assign
to Buyer all of their rights and obligations under the Specified Assets, and
(ii) Buyer will accept the transfer and assignment of and agree to assume,
pay, perform and discharge as of the Closing all of such rights and
obligations.



 

28 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Seller and its Affiliates will (and Seller and
its Affiliates, to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement, will
cause Dynegy and its Affiliates to take such actions), and Buyer its
Affiliates will, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Section 6.5, (i) proceed diligently and in good faith and use all
commercially reasonable efforts, as promptly as practicable, to obtain any
required Consents and, if applicable, make any required Filings in connection
with the assignments contemplated by Section 6.5(a), and (ii) cooperate in
good faith with the applicable counterparties to the Specified Contracts and
provide promptly such other information and communications to such
counterparties to the Specified Contracts as such counterparties to the
Specified Contracts may reasonably request in connection therewith. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is specifically acknowledged and agreed that none of
Seller and its Affiliates, Dynegy and its Affiliates, or Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be obligated to pay, reimburse or provide, or cause any of
their respective Affiliates to pay, reimburse or provide, any compensation,
consideration or charge to obtain any such Consent. The Seller and its
Affiliates and Buyer its Affiliates will provide prompt notification to each
other when any such Consent is obtained (or refused) and will advise each
other of any material communications with any counterparties to the Specified
Contracts regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section
6.5 shall not constitute an agreement to assign or assume any obligation,
claim, right or benefit arising under any Specified Asset or resulting
therefrom if an attempted assignment or assumption thereof, without the
Consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach thereof.
Any transfer or assignment to Buyer by the Seller or its Affiliates of any
provision of any Specified Asset that requires the Consent of any third party
shall be made subject to such Consent being obtained. If such Consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would
adversely affect in any material respect the rights or obligations of Seller
or its Affiliates thereunder such that Buyer would not in fact receive all
material rights and obligations to be transferred to Buyer pursuant to
Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(b) above, (i) each Party will execute and
deliver agreements and take such other actions as requested by the other Party
or any of its Affiliates in any arrangement, including an operating,
services, or other back-to-back agreement if requested by either Party,
reasonably designed to provide that Buyer will have all of the rights and
obligations of the applicable Non-DPG Affiliate under any such Specified
Asset to the extent that such rights and obligations are to be transferred to
Buyer pursuant to Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(b) above, and (ii) where any
of Seller or its Affiliates has continuing liability or exposure with respect
to the obligations to be transferred to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.5(a) or
Section 6.5(b) above due to any third partys failure to release Seller as a
result of such third partys unwillingness to accept Buyer as assignee, Buyer
shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from such continuing liability or
exposure. Seller and Buyer will execute and deliver such further instruments
and do such further acts and things as may be required to carry out the intent
and purpose of this Section 6.5, including such further acts and things as
may be required to assist any other party hereto in complying with their
respective obligations under any Specified Agreement.

 

6.6 _Support Obligations_.

 

(a) Buyer recognizes that certain of the Non-DPG Affiliates have provided
credit support to certain of the Companies and with respect to certain of the
Specified Assets



 

29  pursuant to certain credit support obligations, all of which that are
outstanding as of the date hereof are set forth on _Schedule 6.6(a)_ (such
support obligations contained in  _Schedule 6.6(a)_ are hereinafter referred
to as the " _Support Obligations_ ") _provided_ that, Seller may supplement
the obligations listed on _Schedule 6.6(a)_ from time to time prior to Closing
to include any additional Support Obligations to the Companies or with
respect to any Specified Contract entered into in the ordinary course of the
Business, consistent with past practice (provided further that, no such
supplement shall include a Support Obligation for which written consent of
the Seller is required under the Merger Agreement unless Buyer has been
notified by Seller of such supplement and has consented in writing to the
inclusion of such supplement).

 

(b) Prior to Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect
the full and unconditional release, effective as of the Closing Date, of the
Non-DPG Affiliates from all Support Obligations, including by:

(i) furnishing a letter of credit to replace each existing letter of credit
that is a Support Obligation containing terms and conditions that are
substantially identical to the terms and conditions of such existing letter of
credit and from lending institutions that have a credit rating commensurate
with or better than that of lending institutions for such existing letter of
credit;

 

(ii) instituting an escrow arrangement to replace each existing escrow
arrangement that is a Support Obligation with terms equal to or more
favorable to the counterparty thereunder than the terms of such existing
escrow arrangement;

 

(iii) furnishing a guaranty to replace each existing guaranty that is a
Support Obligation, which replacement guaranty is issued by a Person having a
net worth and credit rating at least equal to those of the issuer of such
existing guaranty, and containing terms and conditions that are substantially
identical to the terms and conditions of such existing guaranty; 

(iv) posting a surety or performance bond to replace each existing surety or
performance bond that is a Support Obligation, which replacement surety or
performance bond is issued by a Person having a net worth and credit rating at
least equal to those of the issuer of such existing surety or performance
bond, and containing terms and conditions that are substantially identical to
the terms and conditions of such existing surety or performance bond;

(v) replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on substantially
identical terms and conditions to the existing security agreement or
arrangement that is a Support Obligation; and

 

(vi) providing cash or any other collateral to replace any of the foregoing.

 

(c) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the beneficiary or
beneficiaries of such Support Obligations to (i) remit any cash to Seller or
one of its Affiliates, as applicable, held under any escrow arrangement that
is a Support Obligation promptly following the replacement of such escrow
arrangement pursuant to Section 6.6(b)(i) and (ii) terminate and 



 

30  redeliver to Seller or one of its Affiliates each original copy of each
original guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument constituting or
evidencing such Support Obligations.

 

(d) If Buyer is not successful, for any reason, in obtaining the complete and
unconditional release of the Non-DPG Affiliates from any Support Obligations
by the Closing Date (each such Support Obligation, until such time as such
Support Obligation is released in accordance with Section 6.6(d)(i), a "
_Continuing Support Obligation_ "), then:

 

(i) as of the Closing, Buyer shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain promptly the full and unconditional release of the Non-DPG
Affiliates from each Continuing Support Obligation;

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and the Non-DPG Affiliates for any demand
or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Support Obligation or any
cash or other collateral posted by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with
or in the place of any such Continuing Support Obligation and for the
carrying costs of any cash collateral not replaced by Buyer, the fronting fee
costs, and any other out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses resulting
from such Continuing Support Obligations; and 

(iii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, effect any
amendments or modifications or any other changes to the contracts or
obligations to which any of the Continuing Support Obligations relate, or to
otherwise take any action that could increase, extend or accelerate the
liability of the Non-DPG Affiliates under any Continuing Support Obligation,
without Sellers prior written consent.

6.7 _Conduct of Business Pending the Closing_. 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Companies to (x) operate and
maintain its assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, and (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve, maintain
and protect its assets in material compliance with applicable Permits, Orders
and Laws and the rules and regulations of any applicable independent system
operator or regional transmission organization; _provided_ that, Buyer agrees
and acknowledges that Sellers obligations under this Section 6.7, including
the obligation to cause the Companies to take any actions, are expressly
subject to and limited by Sellers rights to take such action or to cause the
Companies to take such action under the Merger Agreement. 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.7(a) or any other provision herein, Seller may
cause (or consent to actions with respect to) the Companies to take
commercially reasonable actions with respect to emergency situations or to
comply with applicable Laws, Permits or Orders or the direction of any
applicable independent system operator or regional transmission
organization;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall provide Buyer with
notice of such action as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

(c) Seller shall not consent to Dynegys request for approval to take any
action, or waive Dynegys or its Affiliates failure to perform any
obligation under the Merger Agreement primarily relating to the Companies,
their Subsidiaries, the Business, the Stations, or the Specified Assets
without Buyers prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, 



 

31  delayed or conditioned. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any written
request for approval to take any action or grant a waiver for failure take
action pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Seller may not make or consent to
any amendment to the Merger Agreement that would affect or is reasonably
expected to affect (i) in any material respect, the Companies, their
Subsidiaries, the Business, the Stations, or the Specified Assets; or (ii)
the likelihood that the Merger Agreement will be terminated, in each case
without Buyers prior written consent. Seller shall not waive any closing
condition in the Merger Agreement without Buyers prior written approval,
not to unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(d) Seller shall not consent to Dynegys request for approval to take an
action under the Merger Agreement that would result in Dynegy selling or
transferring all or substantially all of Dynegys assets to any third parties
(including the transactions contemplated hereunder) prior to or as a result of
the Closing.

(e) Seller will provide Buyer with any amendments, modifications, or
supplements to the Merger Agreement and all schedules, annexes and exhibits
thereto.

6.8 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts; Transition Services;
Transition Cooperation_.

(a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on _Schedule
6.8(a)_, prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Non-DPG
Affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate, sever, or
assign to Seller or a Non-DPG Affiliate (in each case with mutual releases)
effective upon or before the Closing all Contracts and services between any
of the Companies, on the one hand, and Seller or any Non-DPG Affiliate, on the
other hand, including the termination or severance of insurance policies
(except as otherwise provided under Section 6.11), Tax services, tax sharing
or tax allocation agreements, legal services, banking services (to include the
severance of any centralized clearance accounts) and power purchase agreements
(collectively such Contracts, the " _Terminated Contracts_ "). On and after
the Closing, none of Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates shall
have any further obligations or liabilities pursuant to the Terminated
Contracts and all intercompany receivables and payables shall be cancelled or
paid as of the Closing.

(b) Concurrently with the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall enter into a
Transition Services Agreement on mutually agreeable terms with respect to the
services (and for the duration) specified in the term sheet attached as
_Exhibit C_ (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "). The Parties agree to
include additional administrative and information technology services to
Exhibit C (but for the avoidance of doubt not plant level services) (i)
reasonably requested by Buyer and that Buyer is unable to perform using its
existing resources and the resources acquired in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder and (ii) that Seller is readily able to
perform using resources available to it at the time such services are to be
provided; provided that such services will only be provided for a duration
from Closing no greater than the duration of the most comparable service
listed on Exhibit C on the date hereof. All transition services will be
provided at cost (including fully-loaded costs of labor). Notwithstanding
the items listed on this Exhibit C or any additional administrative or
information technology services described above, Seller is not required to
provide any service to

 



 

32  the extent that such provision of services would violate any applicable Law,
Order or the terms of any Contract; provided that, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent or approval as
necessary under any such Contract to provide such service (provided further,
that, subject to notice and consent from Buyer, Buyer would reimburse Seller
for any out-of-pocket cost or expense to secure any such consent
or additional licenses, or to expand existing contractual rights, to permit
Seller to provide such services).

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall cooperate with one another to, identify any additional
contracts or other assets that are necessary to the operation and maintenance
of the Business, and to in good faith enter into such arrangements as
reasonably acceptable to each of the Parties to transfer such assets (or
rights to the same or similar assets) to Buyer or its Affiliates as of
Closing.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Continuity of Employment at Closing; Offers of Employment._

 

(i) Buyer and Seller intend that there shall be continuity in the provision of
services to the Companies with respect to all Business Employees, immediately
before and immediately after the Closing. Buyer shall ensure that each
Business Employee shall have the opportunity to continue to provide services
to the Companies on and immediately after the Closing Date on such terms as
comply with applicable Law, and on terms (including base salary, wage rate,
bonus opportunities, titles, job responsibilities, schedule and location) no
less favorable in the aggregate than those that apply to such Business
Employee on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and other employee
benefits that otherwise comply with the requirements of this Section 6.9.

 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make
irrevocable offers of employment prior to the Closing Date (to be effective
as of the Closing Date) to each Business Employee who is not already employed
by a Company, on terms and conditions that reflect the requirements of this
Section 6.9. Buyer will communicate such offers of employment in accordance
with applicable Law in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller, and shall
deliver such offers to Business Employees not less than 10 Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. Each Business Employee who accepts Buyers offer of
employment and each employee of the Companies shall be referred to as a "
_Continuing Employee_ " for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(iii) Subject to Section 6.9(e)(ii) below, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and
hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, claims and obligations (including attorneys fees and other costs
of defense) arising out of or otherwise in respect of (A) any severance
obligations with respect to any Business Employee, whether or not such
Business Employee becomes a Continuing Employee, (B) Buyers failure to comply
with the provisions of this Section 6.9, (C) a termination of the employment
of any Continuing Employee, and any other liability whatsoever arising out of
the employment relationship between Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer and a
Continuing Employee, on or after the Closing or (D) any suit or claim of
violation

 



 

33  brought against Seller or any of its Affiliates under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (together with any similar state or local Law
or regulation, "WARN") for any actions taken by the Companies, the Buyer or
any of their Affiliates on or after the Closing with regard to any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee affected by this Agreement.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits._ Effective on the Closing Date,
and for a period of not less than 12 months following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide each Continuing Employee with (i) base salary and incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided
(including equity-based opportunities) to such Continuing Employee as of the
Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (including without limitation defined
benefit and defined contribution savings and retirement (and rate of company
contributions thereunder), employee stock purchase, health, vision,
dental, disability and life insurance benefits, as well as vacation, time
off, sick and holiday pay programs) that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee as of the Closing
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) this provision is not intended to
require Buyer to provide benefits under any specific type of benefit plan and
(B) such compensation and benefits shall be in accordance with the applicable
provisions of any collective bargaining agreement then in effect from time to
time.

(c) _Seller Benefit Plans_. As of the Closing Date, each Business Employee
shall cease to have any right to accrue any benefits, and cease to have any
right to continue as or become an active participant under any Benefit Plan
other than a Company Benefit Plan, or any other incentive, compensation and
benefits arrangements that are sponsored, entered into, contributed to or
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Companies)
("Seller Benefit Plans"), except to the extent of any claim incurred prior to
Closing Date under any group medical, dental, prescription drug or vision
care benefits under any Seller Benefit Plans or to the extent such benefits
continue to be available, by their express terms, through the end of the
calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs (all such post-closing
claims, "IBNR). Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.9(h), Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for any IBNR actually paid by Seller or any Seller
Benefit Plan. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that any Continuing Employee who
(i) as of the Closing is receiving or entitled to receive short-term
disability benefits and who subsequently becomes eligible to receive long-term
disability benefits or (ii) as of the Closing is receiving or entitled to
receive long-term disability benefits, shall become eligible or continue to be
eligible, as applicable, to receive long-term disability benefits under a
Seller Benefit Plan that is a long-term disability plan unless and until
such employee is no longer disabled (subject to the terms of the applicable
plan); provided that Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all out-of-pocket costs
associated with such continued provision of benefits after the Closing. As of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for all obligations and
liabilities, whether incurred before, on or after the Closing Date, under all
Company Benefit Plans and any other annual incentive, compensation and
benefits arrangements that are sponsored, entered into or maintained by the
Companies, and no obligations or liabilities under any Company Benefit Plans
shall be retained by Seller or any of its Affiliates, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, under any Benefit Plan that provides for
severance, termination pay and similar compensation and benefits.



 

34 (d) _Annual Cash Incentive_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions
of Section 6.9(b) but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.9(h),
for all Continuing Employees who continue employment with the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Companies) through the earlier of (i) March 15 of
the calendar year after the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
and (ii) the date on which Denali Parent Inc. otherwise pays its annual
bonuses and incentive payments to similarly situated employees (the " _Next
Bonus Payment Date_ "), bonuses and incentive payments shall be paid to such
Continuing Employees on the Next Bonus Payment Date in accordance with the
bonus and incentive plans or programs of Dynegy and its Affiliates, but in no
event in an amount less than the target amount that would have been earned by
such Continuing Employees under such bonus and incentive plans and programs as
in existence immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(e) _Severance_.

 

(i) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.9(b), as of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide severance pay and benefits to each
Continuing Employee whose employment terminates or is terminated on or during
the 12 month period (or 24 month period with respect to those Business
Employees who are covered under the Dynegy, Inc. Executive Change in Control
Severance Plan (the " _Executive CIC Plan_ ")), as applicable, following the
Closing which are no less favorable than those described in the severance
Benefit Plan set forth on Schedule 6.9(e) (the " _Applicable Severance Plans_
") applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
(taking into account increases in compensation and service through the date of
such termination); provided, however, that a Business Employees eligibility
for severance benefits shall be determined using the same requirements for
eligibility set forth in the Applicable Severance Plan as of the Closing. As a
condition of any such severance benefits, Buyer shall require that
affected employees execute (and not revoke) a general release of all claims
against Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates. Buyer and Seller agree
that in the event an independent plan administrator of any Applicable
Severance Plan or a court of competent jurisdiction based on a claim
initiated by a Business Employee for a denial of benefits or otherwise under
the Applicable Severance Plan, determines that any Business Employee is
entitled to any severance or termination benefits under the Applicable
Severance Plan due solely to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the actions taken by Dynegy as set forth in Section 6.9(f) of the
Merger Agreement), any payments made to the applicable Business
Employee pursuant to such determination shall be the sole severance benefit
due such Business Employee by Seller, Buyer, the Companies or their
Affiliates.

 

(ii) Buyer and Seller agree that the transaction and related transactions
contemplated pursuant to this Agreement (including the transfer of any
Business Employees to the Companies prior to the Closing Date and the
Amendment of the Applicable Severance Plan under the Merger Agreement), shall
not constitute events that would entitle any Business Employee to
any severance or similar benefits under any Applicable Severance Plan. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall not (nor shall Seller allow any
plan administrator of the Applicable Severance Plans that is under its
control) determine any Business Employee is entitled to any severance or
termination benefits under the Applicable Severance Plan unless and until such
employees

 



 

35  employment with the applicable Company has been terminated after the Closing
(unless ordered to do otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction based on
a claim initiated by a Business Employee for a denial of benefits or
otherwise under the Applicable Severance Plan); provided, however, for
avoidance of doubt:



     | 1. | Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold Buyer, the Companies
and their Affiliates harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims
and obligations (including attorneys fees and other costs of defense)
arising out of or otherwise in respect of any severance obligations with
respect to any Business Employee under any Applicable Severance Plan solely
triggered by: Sellers failure to meet the requirements of this Section
6.9(e)(ii) unless the employment of the applicable Business Employee is
subsequently terminated after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates under
circumstances that would have required Buyer or its Affiliates to pay
severance or similar benefits under the Applicable Severance Plan; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | Seller shall be solely liable for, and shall indemnify Buyer
for, any and all liabilities, claims and obligations (including attorneys
fees and other costs of defense) arising out of or otherwise in respect of
any severance obligations with respect to any Business Employee under any
Applicable Severance Plan triggered by Dynegys failure to fully comply with
Section 6.9(f) of the Merger Agreement unless the employment of the
applicable Business Employee is subsequently terminated by Buyer or its
Affiliates after the Closing under circumstances that would have required
Buyer or its Affiliates to pay severance or similar benefits under the
Applicable Severance Plan (in which case Buyer shall bear 100% of such costs). 
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer shall jointly
share liability, on a 50/50 basis, for, any and all liabilities, claims and
obligations (including attorneys fees and other costs of defense) arising
out of or otherwise in respect of any severance obligations with respect to
any Business Employee under any the Executive CIC Plan triggered by Dynegys
failure to amend the Executive CIC Plan as described in 
Section 6.9(f) because Seller concludes such amendment violates the terms of
the Executive CIC Plan, unless the employment of the applicable Business
Employee is subsequently terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates after the
Closing under circumstances that would have required Buyer or its Affiliates
to pay severance or similar benefits under the Applicable Severance Plan (in
which case Buyer shall bear 100% of such costs). 
---|---|--- 
 

Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to mitigate all potential
severance or termination payments and benefits described in this Section
6.9(e)(ii).

(f) _Service Credit_. With respect to any incentive, compensation or employee
benefit arrangements as may be maintained for Continuing Employees from time
to time following the Closing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
without limitation plans or policies providing severance benefits, vacation
entitlement, and sick pay), service by such Continuing Employees performed
for Dynegy, the Companies, or any of their Affiliates (or a predecessor to
either such entitys business or assets) shall be treated as service with
Buyer and its Affiliates, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accruals (other than with respect to any
defined benefit plan) to the same extent such service was recognized under a
comparable Seller Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(g) _Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations_.

 

(i) Buyer agrees to waive any waiting periods or limitations for preexisting
conditions for each Continuing Employee under the welfare benefit programs of
Buyer (other than any disability programs) made available to such Continuing



 

36  Employee on or following the Closing Date, to the same extent such periods
or limitations would have been or were waived under a Seller Benefit Plan for
the same purpose under the comparable type of welfare benefit program in
which such Continuing Employee was participating or eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer further agrees to credit each
Continuing Employee for amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under the
welfare benefit program in which such Continuing Employee was participating
immediately prior to the Closing Date towards satisfaction of the applicable
deductibles and out-of-pocket limits under the comparable type of welfare
benefit program of Buyer or its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee
first participates on or after the Closing Date, to the same extent such
credit was given under the applicable Seller benefit plan that is a welfare
benefit program, and in each case in respect of the plan year in which occurs
the Closing Date.

(ii) Buyer also shall honor all vacation, personal and sick days accrued by
such Continuing Employees under the plans, policies, programs and arrangements
of the Companies, Seller or its Affiliates (or a predecessor to either such
entitys business or assets) immediately prior to the Closing Date, but only
to the extent required under Section 6.9(h).

(iii) Seller shall retain all liabilities to provide retiree medical benefits
to the Continuing Employees under the Benefit Plans that provide for retiree
medical benefits (the " _Seller Retiree Plans_ ") to the extent such
Continuing Employees meet the eligibility requirements to receive benefits
under such plans as of the Closing.

(iv) Buyer shall provide continuation health care coverage to Continuing
Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur a qualifying event, in
accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA and any similar
state or local Law (" _COBRA_ ") after the Closing.

(h) The following shall be "Excluded Liabilities:" (a) all of Sellers
obligations under any Seller Benefit Plan that is a "pension plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), regardless of whether such pension
plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and (b) the
amount by which the following amounts exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate, (x)
any amount that the Companies are required to pay to Continuing Employees as
annual bonuses and incentive payments pursuant to Section 6.9(d), (y) the
amount of all accrued vacation, personal and sick days or paid time off as set
forth in Section 6.9(g)(ii) for the Continuing Employees, measured as of the
Closing and (z) IBNR, but only to the extent such IBNR are actually paid by
the Companies (as opposed to being paid by Seller or its Affiliates or the
Seller Benefit Plans).

 

(i) _Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs_. Provided that on or before the
Closing Seller has supplied Buyer with a list of Business Employee
terminations, by date and location, implemented by Seller in the 90-day period
prior to Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any
Liabilities under the WARN Act arising, in whole or in part, from Buyers
actions or omissions occurring on or after the Closing. Seller shall
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any Liabilities under the WARN Act
arising solely as a result of Sellers

 



 

37  acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such indemnity shall not be effective with regard to any errors in such
list as supplied to Seller by Dynegy under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

(j) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Buyer hereby acknowledges
and recognizes that, as of the Closing Date, contractual obligations with the
union representing bargaining unit employees of the Companies will continue,
including all contractual obligations under (i) the Agreement between the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 and Dynegy Inc.,
August 7, 2007 through August 6, 2010 (the " _CBA_ ") and (ii) the Agreement
by and between Dynegy West Generation, Inc. and Local Union 1245 of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers AFL  CIO, effective July
21, 2010, regarding the extension of the CBA (subject to future bargaining
between the union and the Companies or the Companies Affiliates).

 

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third
party (including any employee or dependent or beneficiary of any employee or
trustee) any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9(a) or (iii)
obligate Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates to retain the
employment of any particular employee for any period of time or to maintain
any particular Benefit Plan or benefit, except to the extent otherwise
required by Section 6.9(d) with respect to the bonuses and incentive
payments. 

6.10 _Seller Marks_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates, including the Companies, to: (i) cease using any names, marks,
trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos incorporating
"Dynegy", including those listed in  _Schedule 6.10_ and any word or
expression similar thereto or constituting an abbreviation or extension
thereof (collectively and together with all other names, marks, trade names,
trademarks and corporate symbols and logos owned by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, the " _Seller Marks_ "); and (ii) remove from the Stations (and
other assets of the Companies) and any Specified Assets any and all Seller
Marks and amend the relevant organizational documents of the Companies to
change the names of the Companies to names that do not include any Seller Mark
or any name or term confusingly similar to any Seller Mark. Thereafter, Buyer
shall not use any Seller Mark or any name or term confusingly similar to
any Seller Mark in connection with the sale of any products or services, in
the corporate or doing business name of any of its Affiliates or otherwise in
the conduct of its or any of its Affiliates businesses or operations. In the
event that Buyer breaches this Section 6.10, Seller shall be entitled to
specific performance of this Section 6.10 and to injunctive relief against
further violations, as well as any other remedies at law or in equity
available to Seller.

 

6.11 _Insurance_. The Seller will cause Dynegy or the Companies or their
Affiliates to keep insurance policies currently maintained with respect to
any member of the Companies, any of their businesses, assets and current or
former employees, as the case may be, or suitable replacements therefor, in
full force and effect through the Closing; provided that, Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that Sellers obligations under this Section 6.11 to cause Dynegy
or the Companies or their Affiliates to maintain insurance are expressly
subject to and limited by Sellers rights to require Dynegy to
maintain insurance policies in full force and effect in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions of the interim operating covenants of

 



 

38  Dynegy under the Merger Agreement. To the extent that after the Closing any
Party hereto requires any information regarding claim data, payroll or other
information in order to make one or more filings with insurance carriers or
self insurance regulators from another party hereto, the Party to whom the
request is made will promptly supply such information. In the event that any
of Seller, the Companies, or Non-DPG Affiliates (with respect to Specified
Assets) incur losses which are covered by such insurance policies, Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing, and upon Buyers direction at Buyers
sole cost and expense, cooperate with Buyer in pursuing any claim with
the relevant insurance carrier. Seller shall assign or cause to be assigned
the insurance proceeds therefrom to Buyer at Closing or if received after the
Closing Date, promptly upon receipt of such payment; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Casco Bay Loss, any
insurance claim related thereto shall be retained by Seller or its Affiliates,
along with any related insurance proceeds therefrom.

 

6.12 _Exclusivity_. During the period commencing on the date hereof and
continuing until the earliest to occur of (i) two hundred and seventy (270)
days from the date of this Agreement, (ii) the consummation of an acquisition
of the Companies by a third party, directly or indirectly (either as part of
an acquisition of Dynegy, merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or
sale, or otherwise) (an " _Alternative Transaction_ "), and (iii) ninety (90)
days after the shareholder vote on the Merger Agreement, each of the Seller
and Buyer shall not (and shall cause their respective Representatives not to)
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, intentionally encourage or take
any other action designed to solicit an Alternative Transaction, (ii) enter
into negotiations with respect to, or execute, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Alternative Transaction or (iii) furnish non-public information
to any Person or entity with respect to an Alternative Transaction, except
for (a) actions in connection with the Merger Agreement, (b) actions by
Seller, its Affiliates or their Representatives with any lenders or other
counterparties who might provide asset sale bridge financing secured by, or
hedges relating to, some or all of the Companies or Business, and (c) actions
by Buyer, its Affiliates or their Representatives, advisors, lenders and
rating agencies in connection with this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. By Closing, Seller shall obtain
the resignations or removal of the officers (except to the extent such
officers are Continuing Employees) and directors of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries.

6.14  _Indemnity for Excluded Liabilities_. Seller shall indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless the Buyer, its Affiliates, and its and their Representatives
from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, losses, liabilities,
penalties, damages, obligations, payments, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection therewith) attributable
to the Excluded Liabilities.

 

6.15 _Indemnity for Assumed Liabilities and Station Liabilities_. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates, and its and
their Representatives from and against any and all claims, demands, suits,
losses, liabilities, penalties, damages, obligations, payments, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection
therewith) attributable to the Assumed Liabilities or any Liabilities
primarily related to the ownership, maintenance or operation of the Stations,
whether residing within or outside of 



 

39  the Companies, _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not
be required to indemnify Seller for any Excluded Liabilities listed on
Schedule 1.1(46).

 

6.16 _Defense of Claims_.

 

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any Indemnifiable
Loss or of the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding made or brought
by any Person who is not an Indemnitee (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") with
respect to which indemnification is to be sought from an Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof, but in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days after
the Indemnitees receipt of notice of such Third-Party Claim; provided the
failure to do so shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
except to the extent that it is prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving
such notice. Such notice shall describe the nature of the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail and shall indicate (in each case, to the extent known) (i)
the bases of the claim for indemnification, (ii) the amount or the method of
computation of the amount of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be
incurred by the Indemnitee and (iii) a reference to the provision or
provisions in this Agreement upon which such claim is based. Within ten (10)
Business Days after receiving such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnitee, to
elect to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at such Indemnifying
Partys own cost and expense and by such Indemnifying Partys own counsel.

(b) Pursuant to the notice requirement in the final sentence of Section
6.16(a), in the case of a claim by a Buyers Indemnitee, Seller, and in the
case of a claim by a Sellers Indemnitee, the Buyer, shall be entitled to
direct the defense against a Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is
sought hereunder, with counsel selected by it and reasonably acceptable to the
other, provided that (i) the Buyer or Seller (as applicable) is conducting a
good faith defense, (ii) the Buyer (in the case of a claim by a Sellers
Indemnitee), or Seller (in the case of a claim by a Buyers Indemnitee), has
irrevocably acknowledged in writing its obligation to provide indemnification
for such claim and (iii) the only relief sought by such Third-Party Claim is
monetary (rather than equitable) in nature, and provided, further, that such
party directing the defense shall not compromise or settle it without
receiving a release of the indemnified parties and the indemnified parties
not becoming subject to non-monetary penalties, obligations or restrictions as
a result thereof; in all other events, the indemnified parties (acting through
the Buyer, in the case of a Buyers Indemnitee, or through Seller, in the
case of a Sellers Indemnitee) shall have the exclusive right to direct the
defense against such Third-Party Claim (at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party), with counsel selected by it and reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnifying Party, provided, that the indemnified parties shall not
compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim without receiving a release of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party not becoming subject to non-
monetary penalties, obligations or restrictions as a result thereof. Parties
who are not directing the defense shall at all times have the right to
participate in the defense of a Third-Party Claim in reasonable respects and
at their own expense directly or through counsel of their choosing that is
reasonably acceptable to the party directing the defense; provided that if the
named parties to the action or proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party
and one or more indemnified parties, the Indemnifying Party is directing the
defense, and an indemnified party is advised by counsel in writing that
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional 



 

40  conduct, the indemnified parties may engage one separate counsel to
represent them at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) If no such notice of intent to dispute and defend a Third-Party Claim is
given by the Buyer or Seller (whichever is authorized to act on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph), or
if such good faith defense is not being, or ceases to be, conducted by the
Buyer or Seller (as applicable), the other shall have the right, on behalf
of the indemnified parties and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
undertake the defense of such claim (with counsel selected by it and
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) and to compromise or settle
it (at the Indemnifying Partys expense), subject to receipt of a release of
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party not becoming subject to non-
monetary penalties, obligations or restrictions as a result thereof. If the
Third-Party Claim is one that by its nature cannot be defended solely by the
party directing the defense, then the other party hereto shall make available
such information and assistance (including without limitation its officers,
employees and agents) as the party directing the defense may reasonably
request and shall cooperate with such party directing the defense in such
defense (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party).

 

(d) Any Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all
losses, damages and the like relating to a claim under the indemnification
provisions in Sections 6.5(c),6.6(d)(ii), 6.9(a)(iii), 6.9(e), 6.9(i), 6.14
and 6.15, including availing itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of
contribution, claims against third Persons and other rights at law or equity.
For purposes of this Section 6.16(d) , the Indemnitees commercially
reasonable efforts shall include the reasonable expenditure of money to
mitigate or otherwise reduce or eliminate any Indemnifiable Loss for which
indemnification would otherwise be due, and, in addition to its other
obligations hereunder, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse
the Indemnitee for the Indemnitees reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
undertaking such mitigation, reduction or elimination.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any indemnification relating to Taxes shall be
governed by Article VIII and not this Article VI.

43 ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

 

8.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its
Representatives (each, a " _Buyer s Tax Indemnitee_") and its Affiliates
from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, losses, liabilities,
penalties, damages, obligations, payments, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in connection therewith) attributable
to (i) any Taxes of the Companies with respect to any taxable period that ends
on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") and with
respect to any taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), for the portion thereof ending on the Closing
Date; and (ii) any breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 4.6 (each, a " _Tax Indemnifiable Loss_ "). The indemnification for
Taxes provided pursuant to this Section 8.1(a) shall not cover any Tax
liabilities resulting from any action taken on the Closing Date after the
Closing by the Buyer (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder),
any of its Affiliates, or any transferee of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of the Seller to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyers Tax
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) shall terminate at the close of
business on the 30th day following the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect
to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

 

8.2 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be deemed to be:

(a) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or,
in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and

 

(b) In the case of Taxes not described in Section 8.2(a) above (such as
franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts,
based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the
amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

8.3 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed (in a manner consistent with past practices) with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities all Tax Returns in respect of the Companies that are
required to be filed in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and shall pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

 



 

44 (b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
when due all other Tax Returns with respect to the Companies and shall remit
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns; _provided_ that any such Tax
Return in respect of a Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ ")
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice; _provided
further_ , that Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed any such Straddle Period Tax Return that is required to be filed
within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date and shall remit any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to each Straddle Period Tax Return
to be filed by the Buyer, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Straddle Period
Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Straddle Period Tax Return (including valid extensions) together with a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax allocated to the Seller pursuant to
Section 8.2 in respect of such Straddle Period Tax Return. Seller shall have
the right to review such Straddle Period Tax Return and such allocation and,
within 10 days after the date of receipt by Seller of such Straddle Period Tax
Return and allocation, to request in writing any reasonable changes to such
Straddle Period Tax Return. Seller and Buyer agree to consult and resolve in
good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such Straddle Period
Tax Return and allocation. In the even the Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute within ten (10) days after Buyer has received Sellers written request
for changes, then any disputed issues shall be immediately submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve in a final binding matter prior to the
due date for such Straddle Period Tax Return. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally between Seller and Buyer.
Each of Buyer and Seller shall reimburse the other party no later than
ten (10) Business Days following the due date for any Straddle Period Tax
Return (taking into account any valid extensions thereof) to be filed by the
other party for any Taxes due in respect of such Straddle Period Tax Return
for which such first party is responsible pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4 _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(a) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority, which, if successful,
might result in an indemnity payment to a Buyers Tax Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 8.1, then the Buyer shall give notice to the Seller in writing of such
claim and of any counterclaim the Buyer proposes to assert.

 

(b) Seller, at its own expense, shall control the conduct of all audits,
contests, claims for refunds or other administrative or judicial proceedings
(a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") in respect of Taxes for which Seller is solely
responsible pursuant to this Agreement and may make all decisions taken in
connection with such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel).
Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding at its own
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not settle such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, if such Tax Proceeding could have a material
adverse impact on the Taxes of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

(c) The Seller and Buyer shall jointly control and participate in all Tax
Proceedings in respect of Taxes for which both Seller and Buyer are
responsible pursuant to this Agreement and shall bear their own respective
costs and expenses. Neither the Seller nor Buyer shall settle any such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



 

45 (d) Buyer shall control all other Tax Proceedings in respect of Taxes relating
to the Companies.

8.5 _Cooperation_. Seller, the Companies and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
auditors and other representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes, audits, claims for
refunds or reimbursement claims with respect to all taxable periods relating
to Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of
any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such
Tax Proceeding.

8.6  _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree that any indemnification
payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. 

8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, sales and similar Taxes (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Additional
Agreements, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
costs for preparation and filing of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer
Taxes up to the first $1.3 million in Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Buyer
and thereafter any additional Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Seller (and, to
the extent paid by a Party, the other Party shall reimburse such Party upon
request). Buyer shall prepare and file, to the extent required by, or
permissible under, applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by
applicable Law, Seller shall join in the execution of all such Tax Returns and
other documentation; provided, however, that prior to the Closing Date, to
the extent applicable, Buyer shall provide to Seller appropriate certificates
of Tax exemption from each applicable Governmental Authority.

 

8.8 _Refunds_. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, reimbursements,
credits or offsets of Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be for the account of Seller. Buyer agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any such refund, reimbursement,
credit or offset of Taxes. Buyer shall forward, and shall cause
its Affiliates to forward, to the Seller the amount or economic benefit of
any such refund, credit or offset, net of any Taxes imposed on Buyer or its
Affiliates with respect thereto, within ten days after such refund is received
or after such credit or offset is allowed or applied against another Tax
liability, as the case may be.

8.9 _Characterization of Transactions_. The Buyer and Seller agree to treat
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a sale of assets for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (which assets include the equity interests owned
by the Companies in Morro Bay Mutual Water Company and Moss Landing Mutual
Water Company) and neither party shall take a position inconsistent with such
treatment on any Tax Return.

 

8.10 _Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
matter related to Taxes shall be governed solely by this Article VIII.



 

46 ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION

 

9.1 _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
mutual written consent of the Parties.

 

(b) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, upon written notice to the other Party, (i) at any time prior
to the Closing if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing,
and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable;  _provided_ , that
the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(b)(i) shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to seek relief
from such Order; (ii) at any time prior to the Closing if any Law shall have
been enacted or issued by any Governmental Authority which prohibits the

the Closing shall not have occurred or is not reasonably likely to occur

") ( _provided_ , that (x) if on the Outside Date all the Consents required in
order to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.2(c)
have not been obtained and such Consents are being diligently pursued by the
appropriate Party, and all of the other conditions to Closing contained in
Article VII have been fulfilled or are capable of being fulfilled, then, at
the option of either Buyer or Seller (which shall be exercised by written
notice on or before the Outside Date), the Outside Date shall be extended to
nine (9) months after the date of this Agreement, and (y) in all events, if at
any time the Outside Date is a date that is before the "Termination Date" (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), then the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended to be the same date as such "Termination Date"); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the right to so terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of this Agreement
has caused, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer, upon written notice to Seller
at any time prior to Closing, if there has been a material breach by Seller
of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, which breach has had a Material Adverse Effect and such breach is

days after receipt by Seller of notice specifying in reasonable detail the
nature of such breach, unless Buyer shall have previously waived such breach.

 

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller, upon written notice to Buyer
at any time prior to Closing, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of
any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, which breach has had a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and such

10.8 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent
such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in the Chosen
Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate, or that this Agreement or any such document
may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the Parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or proceeding
shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts. The Parties hereby
consent to and grant any such Chosen Court jurisdiction over the person of
such Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in 



 

52  connection with any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 10.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be
valid, effective and sufficient service thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.8.

 

(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that each
Party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof. Subject to paragraph (e) below
solely with respect to Buyers rights and remedies against Seller, the Parties
further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Party in respect of any breach or alleged breach
hereunder or under any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement shall be
to seek specific performance to prevent or cure such breaches by the other
Party and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including upon consummation of the Merger to obtain an order of
specific performance requiring the other Party (if all conditions in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied) to effect the Closing in
accordance with Section 2.1, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement. Each Party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that (x) the other Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. 

(d) The Parties further agree that (x) the seeking of the remedies provided
for in Section 10.8(c) by another Party to this Agreement shall not in any
respect constitute a waiver



 

53  by either Party of its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to either of them under this Agreement, from and after the Closing,
and (y) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require any Party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit such Partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under Section 10.8(c) prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article IX, nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to Section 10.8(c) or anything
set forth in this Section 10.8(d) restrict or limit any Partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article IX or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

(e) In addition to the limitations set forth in Section 10.8(c) above, in no
event shall Buyer be entitled to any remedy of specific performance intended
to force Seller or any of its Affiliates to fulfill any obligation under the
Equity Commitment Letter or consummate the Merger. In the event the Closing
under the Merger Agreement does not occur for any reason, including as a
result of any breach or alleged breach by the Seller under the Merger
Agreement or by Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter, neither the
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates under or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, and Buyer
shall not be permitted to pursue any claims or remedies against the Seller
under or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, either at law or in
equity; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit the
Sellers obligation to perform its obligations under this Agreement
(other than any obligation to consummate, or use its reasonable best efforts
to consummate, the Merger), or the Buyers right to seek specific performance
of Sellers obligations hereunder (other than In respect of any obligation to
consummate, or use its reasonable best efforts to consummate, the Merger),
until such date on which any party to the Merger Agreement asserts a dispute
exists among the parties to the Merger Agreement or otherwise asserts a right
to terminate the Merger Agreement.

10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile transmission
(with confirmation) and in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 

10.10 _Interpretation_. The Article and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the Parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
construction of this Agreement. Ambiguities and uncertainties in the wording
of this Agreement shall not be construed for or against any Party, but shall
be construed in the manner that most accurately reflects the Parties intent
as of the date of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that it has been
represented by counsel in connection with the review and execution of this
Agreement, and, accordingly, there shall be no presumption that this
Agreement or any provision hereof be construed against the Party that drafted
this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of any Additional Agreement to
the contrary, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control any
conflict or inconsistency between or among the provisions of this Agreement
and the provisions of any such Additional Agreement.

 

10.11 _Schedules and Exhibits_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be
and hereby are made a part of this Agreement.



 

54 10.12 _Disclosure_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
all Schedules referred to herein are intended to be and hereby are made a
part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in any Partys Schedule under this

Section hereof shall be deemed to correspond to and qualify any other

Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) or such items are or are not material, and no Party shall
use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of
any such item in the Schedules in any dispute or controversy among the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

10.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits), together with the Additional Agreements (when executed and
delivered by the Parties), constitute a single integrated agreement between
the Parties and, together, embody the entire agreement and understanding of
the Parties hereto in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
Parties with respect to such transactions.

 

10.14 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Dynegy will be an intended third party
beneficiary of, and shall have right of enforcement in respect of the
Parties obligations under this Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree that, other
than Dynegy, this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
third party any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

10.15 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid or enforceable, such provision and (b)
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

FIFTH. The board of directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to
adopt, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Unless and to the
extent the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so require, the election of
directors of the Corporation need not be by written consent.

SIXTH. A director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Any amendment,
modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the corporation hereunder in respect
of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment,

SEVENTH. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may
hereafter be amended, any person (a " _Covered Person_ ") who was or is made
or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom
he or  she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust,

Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided

action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article
Seventh is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor
by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person
may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful

Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not
entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under
applicable law.

(d) The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article Seventh shall
not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate of
incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount
such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses
from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or
non-profit enterprise.

 

(f) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
Seventh shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any
Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time
of such repeal or modification.
