current investigation by the CFTC, whether formal or informal, or whether
preliminary or otherwise, that is reasonably likely to result in, any such
censure, limitations, suspension or revocation.

reasonably designed to prevent and detect any violation of Laws relating to
the Funds current operation, as applicable, and that include financial,
operational, trading, money laundering, internal control and risk control

who have a significant role in respect of internal control over financial
reporting, are adequately and promptly disclosed to the
independent accountants and management of such Subject Entity.

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

any representative or Affiliate of Purchaser in connection with this

Purchaser of __ a Transferred Employee is terminated by Purchaser without

applicable (for __ the purposes of __ this Agreement, reductions in force and

Employees, CIS Limiteds severance policy in respect of cash severance
payments and payment for accrued vacation days as in effect __ on the date

Asset Sellers or any predecessor employer.

Purchaser (" _Purchaser s DC Plan_") shall accept direct rollover

contribution shall be accepted to the extent such contribution would
adversely affect the tax qualified status of Purchasers DC Plan and (ii) in
no event shall a direct rollover contribution be accepted by Purchasers DC
Plan unless such contribution is made in cash or a cash equivalent (e.g.
check or wire transfer).

assets held by the Asset Sellers shall be transferred to the Purchaser.

  

(e) _Termination/WARN Act Notification_. The Purchaser shall be responsible
for sending timely and appropriate notices to all persons required under all

12.4 _Limitations on Certain Claims for Indemnification_.

  

(a) _Basket_. Parent shall not have any liability pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)_ (other than with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any of
the Title and Authorization Warranties, and the Tax and Benefits Warranties
made by Parent) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred
or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds $2,000,000 (the "
_Deductible Amount_ ").  In the event such Losses exceed the Deductible
Amount, Parent shall be liable and responsible to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties only for the amount by which such Losses exceed the Deductible Amount
(subject to _Section 12.4(b)_ ). Purchaser shall not have any liability
pursuant to _Section 12.3(a)_ (other than with respect to any breach of or
inaccuracy in any of the Title and Authorization Warranties made by
Purchaser) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred or
suffered by Parent exceeds the Deductible Amount. In the event such Losses
exceed the Deductible Amount, Purchaser shall be liable and responsible to
Parent only for the amount by which such Losses exceed the Deductible Amount
(subject to _Section 12.4(b)_ ).

  

(b) _Maximum_. In no event shall Parents aggregate liability pursuant to
_Section 12.2(a)_ for Losses incurred or suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (other than with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy
in any of the Title and Authorization Warranties and the Tax and Benefits
Warranties made by Parent) exceed $50,000,000. In no event shall Purchasers
aggregate liability pursuant to _Section 12.3(a)_ for Losses incurred or
suffered by Parent (other than with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in
any of the Title and Authorization Warranties made by Purchaser) exceed the
sum of $50,000,000.

  



  

72   

     
   

  



  

(c) _Claims Based on Fraud or Intentional Misrepresentation_. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein or otherwise to the contrary, including _Sections
12.4(a)_ and _12.4(b)_ , nothing herein shall be deemed to limit any partys
rights to recover any or all Losses incurred or suffered by it relating to or
arising out of or in connection with fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
it being understood and agreed that the right to recover such Losses shall
survive forever.

  

12.5 _Materiality_. For purposes of _Sections 12.2_ , _12.3_  and _12.4_ ,
the representations and warranties herein shall be deemed to have been made
without any qualifications as to materiality and, accordingly, for such
purposes, all references therein to "material", "in all material respects"
and similar qualifications as to materiality shall be deemed to be deleted
therefrom (except where any such provision requires disclosure of lists of
items of a material nature or above a specified threshold).

  

12.6 _Claims_.  As soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of
a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim (or
the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding) of the type described in
_Section 12.7_  or _13.6_ , the Indemnitee shall give notice to the
Indemnitor of such claim; _provided_ , that the failure of the Indemnitee to
give notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this
_Article 12_ except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnitor shall have
been prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnitor does not object in writing to such
indemnification claim within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving notice
thereof, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover promptly from
the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the Indemnitee the
amount of such claim (but such recovery shall not limit the amount of any
additional indemnification to which the Indemnitee may be entitled pursuant
to _Section 12.2_ or _12.3_ ), and no later objection by the Indemnitor
shall be permitted. If within such thirty (30) day period the Indemnitor
agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but objects that it is
obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the Indemnitee shall nevertheless be
entitled to recover from the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall promptly pay
to the Indemnitee the lesser amount, without prejudice to the Indemnitees
claim for the difference.

  

12.7 _Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnitee
shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnitor
of the assertion of any claim (or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto) (other than by a Governmental
Authority with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by _Section 13.6_ )
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that the failure of the Indemnitee to give notice shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations under this _Article 12_ except to the extent
(if any) that the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnitor may, at its own expense, (a) participate in the defense of any
such claim, suit, action or proceeding and (b) upon notice to the Indemnitee
and the Indemnitors delivering to the Indemnitee a written agreement that
the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2_ or
_12.3_ for all Losses arising out of such claim, suit, action or proceeding
and that the Indemnitor shall be liable for the entire amount of any Loss
resulting therefrom, at any time during the course of any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; _provided_ , that (i) the
Indemnitor shall provide written evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee demonstrating that the Indemnitor has a sufficient amount of
assets for purposes of such assumption of defense, (ii) the Indemnitors
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee and (iii) the Indemnitor
shall thereafter consult with the

  



  

73   

     
   

  



  

Indemnitee upon the Indemnitees reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such claim, suit, action or
proceeding. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have
the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnitor. If, however, the Indemnitee reasonably determines in its judgment
that representation by the Indemnitors counsel of both the Indemnitor and
the Indemnitee would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then
such Indemnitee may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding and the Indemnitor shall pay the fees
and disbursements of such separate counsel. Whether or not the Indemnitor
chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim, suit, action or proceeding,
all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof.

  

12.8 _Settlement or Compromise_. Any settlement or compromise made or
caused to be made by the Indemnitee or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, of
any such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in
_Section 12.7_  shall also be binding upon the Indemnitor or the Indemnitee,
as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or decree had
been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such
settlement or compromise;  _provided_ , that (a) no obligation, restriction
or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnitee as a result of such settlement
without its prior written consent, and (b) the Indemnitee shall not
compromise or settle any claim, suit, action or proceeding without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

  

12.9 _Failure of Indemnitor to Act_. In the event that the Indemnitor does
not elect to assume the defense of any claim, suit, action or proceeding,
then any failure of the Indemnitee to defend or to participate in the defense
of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be
done, shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder.

  

12.10 _Set-Off Against Post Closing Payment Amount_. In the event any
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any amount from Parent
under this Agreement, including any indemnification payment under
this Agreement, without limiting the Purchaser Indemnified Partys rights to
seek recovery against Parent directly for amounts in excess of the Post
Closing Payment Amount, the Purchaser Indemnified Party may recover from the
Post Closing Payment Amount.

  

12.11 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. Any amounts payable under _Section 12.2_
 or _Section 12.3_ shall be treated by Purchaser and Parent as an adjustment
to the Adjusted Purchase Price.

  

12.12 _Indemnity Payments in Respect of CIS Limited_.  Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall cause Cargill PLC
to pay any amount which is required to protect, defend, indemnify or hold
harmless CIS Limited under any provision of this Agreement to Purchaser and
not to CIS Limited. For the avoidance of doubt, any such payment shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
12.11_.

  



  

74   

     
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE 13.** 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  

13.1 _Filing of Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Funds, the Acquired
Corporations and Acquired Corporation Subsidiaries for all (a) taxable years
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date
(but not including any Tax Return for such period filed as part of
a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group), (b) taxable years beginning
prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (but not
including any Tax Return for such period filed as part of a consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax group), (c) taxable years beginning after the Closing
Date. Purchaser shall provide to Parent for review and comment each Tax
Return described in _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ of this _Section 13.1_ at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such return (or, if
required to be filed within fifteen (15) days of the Closing Date, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing). Sellers shall reimburse
Purchaser for Taxes paid in _clauses (a)_ and _(b)_ above within fifteen (15)
days of payment by Purchaser or Affiliate of Purchaser to the extent such
Taxes are subject to Parents obligation to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 13.4_.

  

13.2 _Proration of Taxes_. For purposes of allocating liability for Taxes
under _Section 3.5_ and _Section 13.4_ , in the case of any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_
"), (a) real, personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ")
of the Acquired Corporations and the Acquired Corporation Subsidiaries or
related to the Assets or the Business allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (b)
Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Acquired Corporations, and the
Acquired Corporation Subsidiaries or related to the Assets or the Business
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, provided that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period.

  

13.3 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use and transfer Taxes, including any value
added, stock transfer, gross receipts, stamp duty and real, personal, or
intangible property transfer Taxes, arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby or in the Related Agreements, including any
interest or penalties in respect thereof (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
apportioned fifty percent (50%) to Parent and fifty percent (50%) to the
Purchaser. The Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes shall be timely
prepared and filed by the party legally obligated to make such filing, and
Parent agrees to cause Sellers to make any such necessary filings. Parent and
Purchaser agree to, and to cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate
with one another in connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax
Returns, in obtaining all available exemptions from, reductions in, offsets
to, or refunds or credits of such Transfer Taxes and in timely providing each
other with resale certificates and any other documents necessary to obtain
any such exemptions, reductions, offsets, refunds or credits.

  



  

75   

     
   

  



  

13.4 _Tax Indemnification_. From and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, the Acquired
Corporations and the Acquired Corporation Subsidiaries from (a) any and all
Taxes of or payable by the Acquired Corporations or the Acquired Corporation
Subsidiaries attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (b) all Taxes of any
Person for which the Acquired Corporations or any Acquired Corporation
Subsidiary may be liable under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise; (c) all Transfer Taxes allocable to Parent under
_Section 13.3_ ; (d) any and all Taxes payable in the UK by the Acquired
Corporations and the Acquired Corporation Subsidiaries attributable (i) to
the holding or disposal of any shares acquired on or before Closing; or (ii)
to the ownership or cancellation of, or to the acquisition of shares pursuant
to, any right to acquire shares granted on or before Closing; and (e) any and
all amounts of value added tax payable by CIS Limited solely by reference to
CIS Limited being a member of a VAT group between Closing and the date on
which the application referred to in _Section 7.16_ takes effect.

  

13.5 _Cooperation/Retention of Records_. After the Closing, upon reasonable
written notice, Purchaser and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause Sellers
to, furnish or cause to be furnished to one another, as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance (to the extent within the
control of such party) relating to the Acquired Corporations, the Acquired
Corporation Subsidiaries, the Assets or the Business (including access to
books and records) as is reasonably requested for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Governmental Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding related to any Tax Return.

  

13.6 _Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_.

  

(a) After the Closing, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand (the " _Recipient_ "), shall promptly notify the other party in
writing upon receipt by the Recipient or any of its Affiliates of any written
notice of any pending or threatened audit or assessment, suit, proposed
adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative  judicial proceeding or
other similar Claim relating to Taxes (" _Tax Claim_ ") received by the
Recipient from any Governmental Authority or any other party to the extent
such Tax Claim may give rise to an indemnification right under _Section 12.2_
, _Section 12.3_ or _Section 13.4_  under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a failure by Purchaser or the Parent to give such
notice shall not affect the other partys rights to indemnification under
_Article 12_ or _Article 13_ unless the other party is materially
adversely prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.

  

(b) Parent may elect to control the conduct, through counsel of the Parents
own choosing and at the Parents sole expense and with the participation of
Purchaser if Purchaser so elects, of any Tax Claim involving any asserted
liability with respect to or relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than a Tax Claim involving any Straddle Period). If the Parent desires to
elect to control any such Tax Claim, Parent shall within ten (10) calendar
days of receipt of the notice of such Tax Claim notify Purchaser in writing
of its intent to do so. If the Parent properly elects to control such Tax
Claim, then the Parent shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or
concede such asserted liability and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and
shall cause the Acquired

  



  

76   

     
   

  



  

Corporations and the Acquired Corporation Subsidiaries to
reasonably cooperate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede such asserted liability without the written
consent of Purchaser (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if
such settlement, compromise or concession could increase the Tax liability of
any of Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates), any Acquired Corporation or any
Acquired Corporation Subsidiary for any other taxable period. If the Parent
does not elect to control a Tax Claim for a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant
to this _Section 13.6(b)_ (or, after assuming control, the Parent fails to
reasonably defend against such Tax Claim), Purchaser, or its Affiliates may,
without affecting Purchasers or any other indemnified partys rights to
indemnification under _Article 12_ and  _Article 13_ , assume sole control of
the defense of such Tax Claim (at the Parents and Sellers expense).

  

(c) With respect to any Tax Claim that involves any Straddle Period,
Purchaser shall notify the Parent of such Tax Claim and Purchaser shall
control the conduct of any such Tax Claim, through counsel of Purchasers own
choosing with participation by the Parent (at Parents expense) and Purchaser
shall have all rights to settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Claim
with the consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

  

 **ARTICLE 14.** 
  
 NON-COMPETITION

  

14.1 _Non-Competition Agreement_.

  

(a) Parent agrees that from and after the Closing Date until the date that is
five (5) years after the Closing Date (the " _Non-Competition Period_ "),
neither it nor any Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall,
directly or indirectly:

  

(i) engage in, or own any interest in, control, advise, manage, operate,
serve as a director, officer or employee of, act as a lender or consultant
to, render services for, receive any economic benefit from or exert any
influence upon any Person that engages wholly or partly in, the Restricted
Business;

  

(ii) solicit, divert or attempt to solicit or divert any Person who is, was
or was solicited to become, a customer or supplier of any Subject Entity in
connection with the Business at any time prior to the Closing;

business relationship between any third party and Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Corporations or any Acquired Corporation
Subsidiary) in connection with the Restricted Business;

  

(iv) make any statement to any third party, including the press or media,
likely to result in adverse publicity for Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Corporations or any Acquired Corporation Subsidiary)
in connection with the Restricted Business; or

(v) employ, solicit for employment or encourage to leave his or her
employment, on its behalf or on behalf of any other Person, any individual
who was during the two (2) year period prior to such employment, solicitation
or encouragement or is an officer or employee of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Corporations or any Acquired Corporation
Subsidiary) involved in the Restricted Business as conducted by Purchaser and
its Affiliates after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent,
Sellers and their Affiliates may engage in discussions or negotiations with,
and employ, any Person responding to general advertising for employees not
specifically targeted at the employees of the Business.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and its
Affiliates may (i) in the ordinary course of business of Parent and its
Affiliates and not for the purpose of competing, directly or indirectly, with
the Business, own less than 5% of any class of the capital stock of any
corporation engaged in any business that competes, directly or indirectly,
with the Business without violating the provisions of this Section,
_provided_ , _that_ , Parent or its Affiliates does not have the power to
control or direct the management or affairs of such corporation.
 Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Parents Affiliates that
are registered investment advisers shall not be subject to the
restrictions contained in this Agreement with respect to investments that
they make on behalf of funds or managed accounts, including funds in which
Parent owns a minority of the equity interests.

  

14.2 _Reasonableness of Covenants_. _ _Purchaser and Parent have
independently consulted with their respective counsel and after
such consultation agree that the covenants set forth in _Section 14.1_ (each
a " _Non-Competition Covenant_ " and collectively the " _Non-
Competition Covenants_ "), including the time limitation, geographic area
and scope of activity of such Non-Competition Covenants, are appropriate
and reasonable when considered in light of the nature and extent of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements.
Parent further agrees and acknowledges that (a) the Non-Competition Covenants
are of the essence of this Agreement, (b) Purchaser is relying upon Parents
agreements in this _Article 14_ and, but for the agreement of Parent to
comply with the Non-Competition Covenants, Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements, and (c) each Non-
Competition Covenant is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the
interests and properties of Purchaser.

  

14.3 _Specific Performance_. Parent recognizes and affirms that in the event
of breach by it of any of the provisions of this _Article 14_ , money damages
would be inadequate and Purchaser would have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, Parent agrees that Purchaser shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights
and Parents obligations under this _Article 14_ not only by an action or
actions for damages, but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order to enforce or
prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or future) of the
provisions of this _Article 14_. In the event of a breach or violation
by Parent of any of the provisions of this _Article 14_ , the Non-
Competition Period shall be extended as to such individual by a period equal
to (a) the length of the breach or violation of this _Article 14_ plus (b)
the length of any court proceedings necessary to stop such breach or
violation. If a bond is

  



  

78   

     
   

  



  

required to be posted in order for Purchaser to secure an injunction, the
parties agree that such bond need not exceed the sum of $1,000.

  

14.4 _Severability_. If at any time any of the provisions of this
_Article 14_ shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of
being vague or unreasonable as to duration, area or scope of activity, or
otherwise, then this _Article 14_ shall be considered divisible (with the
other provisions to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or
unenforceable provisions shall become and be deemed to be immediately amended
to include only such maximum time limitation, geographic area, scope of
activity and other restrictions, as shall be determined to be reasonable and
enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter,
and Parent expressly agrees that this Agreement, as so amended, shall be
valid and binding as though any invalid or unenforceable provision had not
been included herein.

  

14.5 _No Limitation of Other Provisions_. The provisions of this
_Article 14_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other
provisions contained in any other agreement restricting competition by
Purchaser or any Seller.

  

 **ARTICLE 15.**

but only in writing signed by Purchaser and Parent.

15.4 _Effect of Investigation_. Any due diligence review, audit or
other investigation or inquiry undertaken or performed by or on behalf of
Purchaser shall not limit, qualify, modify or amend the representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations of (including indemnities by) any Seller

Agreements, irrespective of the knowledge and information received (or that
should have been received) therefrom by Purchaser.

  

15.5 _Payments in Dollars_. Except as otherwise provided herein or in
a Related Agreement, all payments pursuant hereto shall be made by wire
transfer in U.S. Dollars in same day or immediately available funds.

  

15.6 _Waivers_.  The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its
right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any
condition or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no
waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other instances or a
waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant,
representation or warranty.

  

15.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

  

15.8 _Assignment_.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs
and legal representatives; _provided_ , that no assignment of any rights or
obligations hereunder shall be made by Parent to any Person without the
written consent of Purchaser and no assignment of any rights or obligations

  



  

80   

     
   

  



  

hereunder shall be made by Purchaser to any Person without the
written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall,
without the obligation to obtain the written consent of any other party
hereto (including Parent), be entitled to assign this Agreement or all or any
part of its rights or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Purchaser. If
any party hereto assigns any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 15.8_ , the parties hereto shall, as
appropriate, modify the exhibits and other documents to be delivered at or
prior to the Closing to either add the assignee as a party to such document
or substitute the assignee for the assignor as the party to such document.

  

15.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the parties hereto and, to the extent provided herein, their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives, and no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to confer
upon other third parties any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause
of action or other right.

  

15.10 _Publicity_.  Prior to the Closing, no public announcement or other
publicity regarding the existence of this Agreement or its contents or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be made by Purchaser, Parent, any
Seller or any of its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
representatives or agents, without the prior written agreement of Purchaser
and Parent, in any case, as to form, content, timing and manner of
distribution or publication; _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section 15.10_ shall prevent (a) Parent or Purchaser from filing a Form 8-K
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or publicly issuing a press
release, in each case, with respect to this Agreement or its contents or the
transactions contemplated hereby (the contents of which Form 8-K and press
release shall be determined by Parent and its Affiliates in their sole
discretion) or (b) any party from (i) making any public announcement required
by Law or the rules of any stock exchange, (ii) discussing this Agreement or
its contents or the transactions contemplated hereby with those Persons whose
approval, agreement or opinion, as the case may be, is required for
consummation of such particular transaction or transactions or (iii)
enforcing its rights hereunder; _provided_   _further_ , that if any party
makes any disclosure pursuant to the foregoing proviso, such party shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide such disclosure to the other parties
hereto at least one Business Day prior to such disclosure and shall consult
with such other parties in good faith as to the contents of such disclosure.

  

15.11 _Further Assurances_. Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Sellers and their respective Affiliates to, on and
after the Closing Date, execute and deliver to Purchaser such
other documents, releases, assignments and other instruments as may be
required to effectuate completely the transfer and assignment to Purchaser
of, and to vest fully in Purchaser title to, the Shares or the Assets, and to
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  

15.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability
of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall
be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and
enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

  



  

81   

     
   

  



  

15.13 _Specific Performance_. Each party recognizes and affirms that in
the event of breach by him or it of any of the provisions of _Section 7.8_ or
_Section 7.10_ money damages would be inadequate and the other parties would
have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each party agrees that the
other parties shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in their favor, to enforce their respective rights and the
breaching partys obligations under _Section 7.8_  and _Section 7.10_ not
only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief in order
to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or
future) of the provisions of _Section 7.8_ or _Section 7.10_. If a bond is
required to be posted in order for any party to secure an injunction, the
parties agree that such bond need not exceed the sum of $1,000.

  

15.14 _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies provided in this Agreement shall be
cumulative and shall not preclude the assertion or exercise of any
other rights or remedies available by Law, in equity or otherwise.

  

15.15 _Entire Understanding_. This Agreement and the Related Agreements
set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all
prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof, but excluding the letter agreement, dated as of
March 11, 2005, between CIS and Purchaser, which remains in full force and
effect.

  

15.16 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  

15.17 _Jurisdiction of Disputes; Waiver of Jury Trial_. In the event any
party to this Agreement commences any litigation, proceeding or other legal
action in connection with or relating to this Agreement, any Related
Agreement or any matters described or contemplated herein or therein, the
parties to this Agreement hereby (a) agree that any such litigation,
proceeding or other legal action shall be brought exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the County of New York, New York,
whether a state or federal court; (b) agree that in connection with any such
litigation, proceeding or action, such parties will consent and submit to
personal jurisdiction in any such court described in _clause (a)_ of this
_Section 15.17_ and to service of process upon them in accordance with the
rules and statutes governing service of process; (c) agree to waive to the
full extent permitted by law any objection that they may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such litigation, proceeding or action in any such
court or that any such litigation, proceeding or action was brought in an
inconvenient forum; (d) designate, appoint and direct CT Corporation System
as their authorized agent to receive on their behalf service of any and all
process and documents in any legal proceeding in the State of New York; (e)
agree to notify the other parties to this Agreement immediately if such agent
shall refuse to act, or be prevented from acting, as agent and, in such
event, promptly to designate another agent in the State of New York to serve
in place of such agent and deliver to the other parties written evidence of
such substitute agents acceptance of such designation; (f) agree as an
alternative method of service to service of process in any litigation,
proceeding or action by mailing of copies thereof to the parties at their
addresses set forth in _Section 15.3_ ; (g) agree that any service made as
provided herein shall be effective and binding service in every respect; and
(h) agree

  



  

82   

     
   

  



  

that nothing herein shall affect the rights of any party to effect service of
process in any other manner permitted by Law. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS DESCRIBED OR
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION
NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO EFFECT SUCH WAIVER.   

83   

     
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Purchase and Sale
Agreement to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
