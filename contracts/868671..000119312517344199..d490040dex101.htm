"), Glacier Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of GBCI (" _Glacier Bank_ "),
Inter-Mountain Bancorp., Inc., (" _IMB_ "), First Security Bank, a wholly
owned subsidiary of IMB (the " _Bank_ "), Bruce A. Gerlach, as proxy ("

Agreement (as defined below).

RECITAL 

As an inducement for GBCI, Glacier Bank, IMB, and the Bank to enter into the
Plan and Agreement of Merger, dated October 26, 2017 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), under which, among other things, IMB will merge with and into
GBCI (the " _Merger_ "), and the Bank will merge with and into Glacier Bank,
each Shareholder agrees as follows:

 

AGREEMENT



   1. | _Voting of Shares_. Each Shareholder will vote or cause to be
voted at any shareholder meeting of IMB to approve the Merger Agreement or any
related transaction, or any adjournment or postponement thereof (an " _IMB
Meeting_ "), all shares of IMB common stock that such Shareholder owns of
record or beneficially, with power to vote or direct the voting of such shares
(collectively, the " _Owned Shares_ "), (a) in favor of (1) approval of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the
Merger, (2) any other matter that is required to facilitate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (3) any proposal to adjourn or
postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to
approve the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 



   2. | _Beneficial Ownership_. On the date of this Agreement, each
Shareholder represents and warrants, severally but not jointly, that the Owned
Shares set forth on such Shareholders signature page (a) are owned of record
or beneficially by the Shareholder in the manner reflected thereon, (b)
include all of the shares of IMB common stock owned of record or beneficially
by the Shareholder, and (c) are free and clear of any proxy or voting
restriction, claims, liens, encumbrances, and security interests, except (if
applicable) as set forth on the Shareholders signature page, which
encumbrances or other items do not affect in any respect the ability of
the Shareholder to perform the Shareholders obligations under this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, each Shareholder has and at any
IMB Meeting each Shareholder will have (except as otherwise permitted by this
Agreement) sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to all
of the Shareholders Owned Shares, except as otherwise reflected on the
Shareholders signature page. 
---|--- 
 



\- 1 - ---|--- 



     | a. | _Appointment of Proxy_. In order to better effect the
provisions set forth in Section 1 above, each Shareholder hereby revokes any
previously executed proxies and hereby constitutes and appoints Gerlach,
with full power of substitution, such Shareholders true and lawful proxy and
attorney-in-fact (the " _Proxy Holder_ ") to vote at any IMB Meeting all
of the Shareholders Owned Shares as provided in Section 1 above, with such
modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties to the Merger Agreement
may make; but this proxy will not apply with respect to any vote on the Merger
Agreement if the Merger Agreement is amended so as to reduce the amount or
form of consideration to be received by the shareholders of IMB or change the
tax consequences of the receipt thereof under the Merger Agreement in its
present form. This irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon
termination of this Agreement _._ 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | _Substitute_. If for any reason Gerlach becomes unable to
perform his duties as Proxy Holder under this Agreement, Gerlach hereby
appoints Substitute as substitute proxy to act as the Proxy Holder.
Substitute, by signing below as substitute proxy holder, agrees to vote all
of each Shareholders Owned Shares at any IMB Meeting as provided in Section 1
above, with such modifications to the Merger Agreement as the parties to the
Merger Agreement may make; but this proxy will not apply with respect to any
vote on the Merger Agreement if the Merger Agreement is amended so as to
reduce the amount or form of consideration to be received by the shareholders
of IMB or change the tax consequences of the receipt thereof under the Merger
Agreement in its present form. Notwithstanding the above, Gerlach may from
time to time, in his discretion, appoint any other substitute proxy to act as
the Proxy Holder upon notice to GBCI. 
---|---|--- 
 



   4. | _Acknowledgments_. Each Shareholder acknowledges that GBCI and
IMB are relying on this Agreement in incurring expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the proxy granted
under this Agreement is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The Shareholders and IMB
acknowledge that the performance of this Agreement is intended to
benefit GBCI. The vote of the Proxy Holder will control in any conflict
between such vote of the Owned Shares and a vote by any substitute proxy
holder or the Shareholder, and IMB agrees to recognize the vote of the Proxy
Holder. 
---|--- 
 



   5. | _No Transfer_. Until the earlier to occur of (a) the completion
of the Merger or (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement, no Shareholder
will sell, transfer, permit a lien or other encumbrance to be created with
respect to, or grant any proxy in respect of (except for proxies solicited by
the board of directors of IMB in connection with the IMB Meeting at which the
Merger Agreement is presented for shareholder approval) any of the Owned
Shares, unless all other parties to any such sale or other transaction enter
into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to GBCI embodying the
benefits and rights contained in this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



\- 2 - ---|--- 



     | a. | _Individual Obligations_. The obligations of each of the
signatories to this Agreement are independent of one another and are not
intended to be joint obligations of the undersigned. This Agreement is
intended to be enforceable by GBCI or Glacier Bank against each Shareholder
individually. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | _Binding Effect_. This Agreement will inure to the benefit
of, and will be binding upon, each Shareholders heirs or legal
representatives. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c. | _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of such provision to any person or circumstances will be held
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision
or application will be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid or
unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons or
circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and the
remainder of this Agreement, will not be affected. 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | _Reformation_. If any court determines that the obligations
and restrictions set forth in this Agreement are unenforceable, then the
parties request such court to reform any unenforceable provisions to the
maximum obligations or restrictions, term, and scope, as applicable, that
such court finds enforceable. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | _Expenses_. Except as otherwise may be agreed in writing,
all costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such costs, fees, and expenses. 
---|---|--- 



     | f. | _Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed (i) in the case of an amendment, by GBCI and the Shareholder to be
bound by such amendment and (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

     | g. | _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Montana. The parties

Missoula Division for the State of Montana. Each party consents to and submits
to the jurisdiction of any such court. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 3 - to injunctive relief and/or specific performance, as well as to any other
legal or equitable remedies it may be entitled to, it being agreed that money
damages alone would be an inadequate remedy for such breach. The rights and
remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement shall be
effective from the date hereof and shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time (as defined
in the Merger Agreement), (ii) such date and time as termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (iii) upon mutual written
agreement of the parties hereto to terminate this Agreement. Upon termination

under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | j. | _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, including facsimile and/or scanned counterparts, each of
