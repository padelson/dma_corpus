certificates of the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock
Certificates") in exchange for the payments in accordance herewith. The Letter
of Transmittal shall include, without limitation, a form of certificate, to be

applicable, stating that the Company Shareholder is not a "foreign person,"
dated as of the Closing Date and in form and substance as required under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) and as set out in Exhibit C.

(b) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of its Company Stock Certificate(s),

Shareholder will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the
payments in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its
Company Stock Certificate(s) in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, this Article 2. Until so surrendered, each such Company Stock



11

 Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Representative
Reimbursement Amount, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.4(h), and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(g).

Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall inform the Paying Agent
whether any transfer or other similar Taxes are required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock
Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Taxes are not payable. If such transfer or other similar Taxes are
payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Paying Agent shall
withhold and deduct from the Merger Consideration (including Stock
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock)
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the designated Person other
than the registered holder such amounts as the Paying Agent determines is
necessary based on the information supplied by the registered holder.

(d) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration or
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and a portion of
the Representative Reimbursement Amount in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Article 2.

(e) At any time following the twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
remaining portion of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock payable upon due surrender of applicable
Company Stock Certificates, not distributed to Company Shareholders that was
deposited with the Paying Agent at or after the Effective Time in accordance
with Section 2.4(g), Section 2.4(h) or Section 2.10(d) (the "Exchange Fund")
(including any interest received with respect thereto and other income
resulting from investments by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent), and
Company Shareholders shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the
Exchange Fund, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Company Shareholder
for any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(f) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the execution of an indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Company Stock Certificate(s), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to issue the



12

 Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificates.

(g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
surrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.4(h) below, and
all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable in connection with Closing Stock Consideration
shall be paid by Parent to the Paying Agent and shall be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.4(h) below. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of
any such Company Stock Certificate there shall be paid to any such Company
Shareholder receiving a certificate for Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock
Certificate") representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such Company Shareholder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.4(h) below at Closing, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent cash for these
purposes, if necessary. Dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund with a record date after the
Effective Time ("Shareholder Distributions") shall be (x) deposited by Parent
into the Escrow Fund when paid and (y) released to the applicable party to
which the corresponding shares of Parent Common Stock are released from the
Escrow Account in accordance with Section 8.8(e) simultaneously with the
release of such shares.

(h) No Parent Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock
Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of Parent.
In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Company Shareholder of a Company
Stock Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fractional share interest (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Stock to be received by such Company Shareholder) in exchange for such Company
Stock Certificate shall receive from the Paying Agent, Parent or Escrow Agent,
as applicable, an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which
such Company Shareholder (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time) would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) the Parent Closing Price. Parent shall make available to the
applicable party cash for these purposes, if necessary. For U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the amount of any cash consideration paid pursuant to
this Section 2.4(h) in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be treated as though such fractional share interests were first
delivered to affected Company Shareholders and then redeemed.



13

 (i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the Paying
Agent, and instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay and distribute, sufficient
(i) shares of Parent Common Stock to permit prompt payment of the Closing
Stock Consideration and (ii) cash to permit prompt payment of the cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in connection with the
Closing Stock Consideration.

Section 2.5 Escrow. An amount equal to 10% of the Total Consideration (the
"Escrow Amount"), all of which shall be in the form of Parent Common Stock
valued at the Parent Closing Price, shall be deposited by Parent with the
Escrow Agent into the Escrow Fund on or prior to the Effective Time, and shall
be subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

Section 2.6 Certain Adjustments. If the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock as of the date of this Agreement changes into a different number of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or combination,
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect
of such stock, or any similar event (any such action, a "Parent Adjustment
Event"), the Exchange Ratio for any payment or issuance occurring
simultaneously with or after such Parent Adjustment Event and the floor and
ceiling prices utilized in determining the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted to provide to the Company Shareholders the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Parent
Adjustment Event.

Section 2.7 Rights of Dissenting Shareholders.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the ACC, all Dissenting Shares shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration or any
portion of the Representative Reimbursement Amount. Such shareholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the fair value of Dissenting Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of AS 10.06.580 of the ACC, except that
all Dissenting Shares held by Company Shareholders who have failed to perfect
or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights under AS 10.06.574 of
the ACC shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the applicable portion of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 9.1(b).

(b) Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for fair value
received by Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other similar
instruments served pursuant to the ACC and received by Company and (ii) the
opportunity, in consultation with Company, to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the ACC. Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for fair value or offer to settle or settle any
such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a demand, subject to
Company's legal duties and obligations under the ACC.



14

 Section 2.8 Closing Balance Sheet.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent an estimated unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing, which shall be prepared in accordance with
the Company's historical accounting practices and consistent with GAAP,
together with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital").

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in any event no
later than sixty (60) days thereafter, Parent shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Shareholders' Representative its unaudited balance sheet of
the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing, which shall be prepared in
accordance with the Company's historical accounting practices and consistent
with GAAP, together with a statement (the "Closing Date Statement") setting
forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital
(the "Final Closing Net Working Capital").

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause Parent's Affiliates and its and their
accountants to, make such information, books, records, properties, schedules,
analyses, work papers, personnel and resources available to the Shareholders'
Representative as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Shareholders'
Representative to review the Closing Date Statement and related underlying
calculations.

(d) In the event that the Shareholders' Representative disputes the
calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Date Statement, the Shareholders' Representative shall notify Parent in
writing (the "Dispute Notice") of the amount, nature and basis of such
dispute, within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing Date
Statement. In the event of such a dispute, Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative shall first use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute
among themselves. If Parent and the Shareholders' Representative are unable to
resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute
Notice, then any remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to a "Big Four"
accounting firm jointly chosen by Parent and the Shareholders' Representative
(the "Audit Firm"). If such disagreement and the determination of the Final
Closing Net Working Capital is submitted to the Audit Firm for resolution,
then (i) the Shareholders' Representative and Parent shall execute any
agreement(s) required by the Audit Firm to accept their engagement pursuant to
this Section 2.8(d), (ii) Parent shall promptly furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Audit Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the computation of the Final Closing Net Working
Capital as the Audit Firm may reasonably request and are available to Parent
or any of its Affiliates, (iii) each Party shall be afforded the opportunity
to present to such Audit Firm, with a copy to the other Party, any other
written material relating to the computation of the Final Closing Net Working
Capital, (iv) the Audit Firm shall review only those items that are in
dispute, (v) the Audit Firm shall not attribute a value to any single disputed
amount greater than the greatest amount proposed by either party nor an amount
less than the least amount proposed by either party, and (vi) the
Shareholders' Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand,
shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Audit Firm
for such determination. The written decision of the Audit Firm shall be
rendered within no more than sixty (60) days from the date that the matter is
referred to such firm and shall



15

 be final and binding on the parties hereto and, in the absence of fraud or
manifest error, shall not be subject to dispute or review. Following any such
dispute resolution (whether by mutual agreement of the parties or by written
decision of the Audit Firm), the Final Closing Net Working Capital (as
determined in such dispute resolution) shall be determined final.

(e) Immediately upon the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period for
giving the Dispute Notice, if no such notice is given, or upon notification by
the Shareholders' Representative to Parent that no such notice will be given,
or immediately upon the resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to this
Section 2.8, Parent's calculations set forth in the Closing Date Statement or
Audit Firm's calculations, as applicable, shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and shall not be subject to dispute or review. In the event
that the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital, such amount shall be repaid on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the Shareholders' Representative to Parent out of the Escrow Fund by the
release of shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Closing Price)
held in the Escrow Fund to Parent. In the event that the Final Closing Net
Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital,
such amount shall be paid on a dollar-for-dollar basis by Parent to the
Company Shareholders (other than Dissenting Shareholders) in the form of Stock
Consideration valued in the same fashion as Stock Consideration paid by Parent
to each Company Shareholder at the Closing.

Section 2.9 Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock or any other recipient of any payment under this
Agreement, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld from such
payment under the Code or other applicable Tax law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, shall notify the Shareholders' Representative of any intent to
withhold any amount from any payment hereunder prior to withholding any such
amounts therefrom and the parties shall work together in good faith to take
such commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary or advisable to avoid
or otherwise mitigate any such withholding. If Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Company Shareholder or other recipient of payments in respect
of which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding. Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate governmental Tax authority.

Section 2.10 Payment of Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall:

(a) Deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section
2.5, to be disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

immediately available funds with the Shareholders' Representative, in
accordance with Section 9.1(b), to be disbursed in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.



16

 (c) Pay, on behalf of the Company, all Transaction Expenses by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, which amounts shall be set forth on a schedule
that the Company shall deliver to Parent and the Shareholders' Representative
not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(d) Deposit shares of Parent Common Stock and cash (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) with the Paying Agent in accordance with Section
2.4(i) sufficient to pay (i) the Merger Consideration (less the Escrow Amount)
and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in
connection with the Closing Stock Consideration, to be disbursed in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement.

Section 2.11 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right,
title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall take, and shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the
name of the Company and otherwise) to take, such action.

representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projects, or
projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

earn the authorized rate of return, as applicable) or (2) the ability of
Parent to continue to operate the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, consistent with past practices. Other than as

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Parent, in consultation with the Company, shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto,
the "Registration Statement") relating to the Merger. The Registration
Statement shall contain a document that will constitute (i) a prospectus
relating to the offering of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Company
Shareholders in the Merger and (ii) a solicitation of the Company Shareholders
for their approval of the Merger at the Shareholders' Meeting (such document

Statement and the portions of the Registration Statement relating to Parent
and the Merger; the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall initially
prepare the portions of the Information Statement relating



39

 to the Company and the Shareholders' Meeting; and Parent and the Company shall

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable and to keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall take all or any action required
under any applicable securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent

the Registration Statement and Information Statement and Parent and the
Company shall reasonably coordinate and cooperate in connection with the
preparation of the Registration Statement, the Information Statement, and any
other related filings.

(b) Parent and the Company shall provide the other party copies of any written
comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the
Registration Statement or Information Statement received by such party from
the SEC as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. Parent shall prepare
and file all responses to such comments; provided, however, that, with respect
to comments relating to the Company or the Shareholders' Meeting, such
responses shall be prepared in consultation with the Company. Parent shall
file with the SEC, and shall furnish the Company copies of, all amendments to
the Registration Statement, all supplements to the Information Statement and
all other filings with and transmittals to the SEC to the extent not publicly
available on EDGAR. Parent shall advise the Company promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable hereunder for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. Parent
shall prepare and file in a timely manner, information, documents and reports
in compliance with the Exchange Act so as to comply with the requirements of
the Exchange Act. If at any time Parent is not required to file reports in
compliance with either Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, Parent
shall reasonably promptly and at its expense upon written request of any
holder of Company Common Stock, make available adequate current public
information with respect to Parent within the meaning of Rule 144(c)(2) under
the Securities Act.

(c) The information supplied by Parent and the Company for inclusion in the
Registration Statement and the Information Statement shall not, at (i) the
time the Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the
Information Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to the Company Shareholders, and (iii) the time of the
Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein not misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time Parent or the Company determines that the Registration
Statement or Information Statement includes a misstatement of a material fact
or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then
the party (Parent or the Company) that makes such determination shall promptly
notify the other, Parent shall promptly file an amendment or



40

 supplement to such document describing such information to the extent required
by applicable law, or the rules or regulations of the SEC, and the Company
shall promptly disseminate such amended or supplemented document to the
Company Shareholders.

Section 5.8 Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary pursuant to any agreement of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary providing for the indemnification of its officers or
directors (the current and former officers and directors of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and all other persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to such provisions or agreements, being referred to collectively as the
"Indemnified Parties"). Parent shall cause the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation to contain the provisions with respect to
exculpation from liability set forth in the Company's Articles of
Incorporation immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and Parent shall not permit any of such provisions, or any
provisions of the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, to be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner
that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

(b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for
the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as set forth in the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required pursuant to this Section
5.8(b) to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
premium currently payable by the Company with respect to such current policy,
it being understood that if the annual premiums payable for such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such
amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of the successors or assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation: (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any other Person, then proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (as the case may be) shall assume all of the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.8.

(d) This Section 5.8: (i) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time; (ii) is intended for the benefit of each Indemnified Party,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives; (iii) shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation; and (iv) provides rights that are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution or similar rights that any Indemnified Party, or any heir or
representative of any Indemnified Party, may have by contract or otherwise.



41

 Section 5.9 Employment and Benefits Arrangements. With respect to any Company
Employee who is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, this Section 5.9
only shall apply to those employment terms, compensation and employee benefits
to the extent they are (i) not negotiated pursuant to collective bargaining or
(ii) negotiated pursuant to collective bargaining, but are intended to be
equivalent to the employment terms, compensation and employee benefits of
Company Employees who are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement;
provided that, in all events, the employment terms, compensation and employee
benefits set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement (as in
effect from time to time) shall be respected by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 5.9 shall limit the negotiating positions that may be taken in
connection with any renegotiation of any collective bargaining agreement
following the Closing Date.

(a) For a period of two years following the Closing Date (the "Continuation
Period"), Parent shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to provide (A) compensation (including
any annual incentive compensation opportunities and bonuses) to the Company
Employees that, in the aggregate, is no less favorable than the compensation
provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(B) benefits (including pension and retiree medical benefits) to the Company
Employees that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the benefits
provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from causing the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to adopt employment or other policies substantially similar to
those applicable to employees of Parent and its other Subsidiaries provided
that such policies don't prohibit or frustrate the foregoing compensation and
benefits obligations during the Continuation Period. During the Continuation
Period, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not terminate the
employment of any Company Employee without "cause" (as determined by Parent in
its reasonable discretion).

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide or cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to provide
each former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who, immediately
prior to the Closing Date, is receiving long-term disability payments or
benefits (which shall be deemed to include medical benefits) or retiree
medical benefits from the Company or any Company Subsidiary retiree medical
benefits or long-term disability payments or benefits (as applicable) at a
level that is substantially comparable to the level of such payments or
benefits provided to such individuals immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) to, cause any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA) maintained by Parent
or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) to
recognize each Company Employee's service with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with such predecessor is
recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary at Closing), for all
purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies; provided, however,
that such



42

 service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

(d) During the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing Date, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable benefit plan of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) to, recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each
Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which such Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents ) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Closing Date.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, provide
any required notice under WARN, and any similar state or local law, and
otherwise comply with such laws with respect to the Company Employees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall create any
right in any employee to continued employment by the Company, Parent, or any
respective Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or preclude the ability of the
Company, Parent, or any respective Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to
terminate the employment of any employee for any reason, except as set forth
in Section 5.9(a). This Section 5.9 shall be binding upon and shall inure
solely to the benefit of the parties hereto (it being understood that other
than the Shareholders' Representative, no Company shareholder, including any
shareholder that is also a Company Employee, is a party to this Agreement),
and nothing in this Section 5.9, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 5.9 or is intended to be, shall constitute or be
construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan,
program, arrangement or policy of the Company, Parent, or any respective
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof. No Company Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.9 and
this Section 5.9 shall not create such rights in any such person.

(f) Parent shall, for at least the first two years following the Closing,
maintain the Company's existing corporate offices in Juneau, Alaska and
maintain the artifacts and property contained therein, continue the charitable
contribution practices of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
community support practices of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In
addition, Parent shall honor the commitments of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries under existing collective bargaining agreements.

 Section 5.10 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's operations prior to
the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

Section 5.11 Tax Matters.

(a) Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause
to be timely filed, all Tax Returns relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. All such
Tax Returns for any taxable period ending at the end of or before the Closing
Date or for any Straddle Period (each a "Pre-Closing Tax Return") shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company to the
extent such past practices comply with applicable Tax law. Parent shall
provide the Shareholders' Representative with a copy of a completed draft of
each Pre-Closing Tax Return for Taxes based on or measured by income (and any
other material Pre-Closing Tax Return) at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for filing thereof, along with supporting work papers, for the
Shareholders' Representative's review and comment, and shall make any
reasonable changes requested by the Shareholders' Representative on such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns. Parent shall timely pay any Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries due after the Closing Date but, for the avoidance of doubt,
without prejudice to any indemnification rights Parent otherwise is entitled
to hereunder (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
penalties and interest incurred as a result of Parent's failure to timely pay
such Taxes).

(b) Parent shall have the exclusive right to control any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes (a "Tax Contest"), provided, however,
that with respect to any Tax Contest for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which
the Company Shareholders reasonably could be expected to have any
indemnification obligation under Section 8.2 (each a "Pre-Closing Tax
Contest"): (i) Parent will notify the Shareholders' Representative in writing
of such Pre-Closing Tax Contest and will keep the Shareholders' Representative
reasonably informed with respect to the defense thereof; (ii) the
Shareholders' Representative, on behalf of the Escrow Participants, will have
the right to participate in the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Contest at the
sole expense of the Escrow Participants; (iii) Parent will consult with the
Shareholders' Representative before taking any significant action in
connection with such Pre-Closing Tax Contest; and (iv) the Shareholders'
Representative shall have the right to approve any settlement of such Pre-
Closing Tax Contest, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned
or withheld. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this
Section 5.11(b) and Article 8, this Section 5.11(b) shall control.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall, unless prohibited by applicable law,
treat the current taxable periods of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
as ending as of the close of the Closing Date. In the case of any Straddle
Period: (i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts
or payroll allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the



44

 Company or any Company Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed
to terminate at such time); and (ii) the amount of any other Taxes allocable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

(d) Any Tax refunds that are received by Parent or any of its Affiliates (or
credits for overpayments for Tax to which any of the foregoing are entitled)
and that relate to Taxes paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or
prior to the Closing Date or Taxes reflected in Final Closing Net Working
Capital shall be for the account of the Escrow Participants, other than
refunds (or credits) that were included as an asset in determining Final
Closing Net Working Capital or are attributable to any loss incurred after the
Closing applied as a carryback to income in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Parent
shall pay to the Escrow Participants any such refund (or the amount of any
such credit), net of any expenses or Taxes incurred by Parent or any of its
Affiliates and specifically and separately attributable to such refund (or
credit), within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such refund (or fifteen
(15) days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit). Except
in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 5.11(a)
or to the extent reasonably and timely requested by the Shareholders'
Representative, Parent shall have no obligation to claim or obtain any refund
or credit that will give rise to a payment to Escrow Participants pursuant to
this Section 5.11(d).

(e) Without the consent of the Shareholders' Representative, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, none of Parent or any
Affiliate thereof shall amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or waive any limitations period with respect
to such Tax Returns, if such amendment, refiling, modification or waiver would
reasonably be expected to result in Damages for which indemnification of
Parent would be required hereunder.

(f) Parent shall not make, or cause to be made, any election under Section 338
of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Any and all Tax sharing agreements between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary on the one hand and any other Person on the other hand shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be obligated to make any
payment pursuant to any such agreement for any past or future taxable period.

(h) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Parent.

(i) Each of the parties hereto will cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party to this Agreement, in connection with any Tax
matters relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (including by the
provision of reasonably relevant records or information (including information
required by Code Sections 6043 and 6043A, if applicable)), including the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 5.11(a) and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Such cooperation



45

 shall include the retention and (upon another party's request) the provision
of records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation
or other proceeding. The party requesting such cooperation will pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the other parties. Parent shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority.

(j) Unless otherwise required by applicable Tax law (as determined by a "Big
Four" accounting firm in an opinion concluding that it is not more likely than
not that the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code) or a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code
(or corresponding or similar provision of state or local law), each of the
parties hereto shall report the Merger for federal and applicable state and
local income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the characterization of
the Merger as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, including
the timely filing of the statements required by Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-3. For the avoidance of doubt: (i) except with respect to the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article 4
and the covenant contained in this Section 5.11(j), Parent makes no
representations or warranties to the Company or any Company Shareholder
regarding whether the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and (ii) the Company acknowledges the
Company and the Company Shareholders are relying solely on their own Tax
advisors in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 5.12 Company Cash. The Company agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, during the Pre-Closing Period, dividend to the Company
Shareholders and/or pre-pay indebtedness in an aggregate amount equal to at
least (a) $8,000,000 less (b) the aggregate amount of out-of-pocket fees and
expenses paid by the Company to brokers, financial advisors, accountants or
legal advisors for services performed in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (such dividends and/or other payments or
distributions, the "Pre-Closing Distributions").

Section 5.13 Company Indebtedness. At the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall have no indebtedness for borrowed money other than (a) the
Closing Indebtedness and (b) inter-company indebtedness among the Company and
any Company Subsidiary. For purposes of clarity, indebtedness for borrowed
money shall not include any amounts owing by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to the Snettisham Agreements (as defined in the Disclosure
Schedules).

any of its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 7. 

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time:

(m) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors;

(n) by either of the Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before December 31, 2014; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available
to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before
December 31, 2014 was caused by the failure of such party or any Affiliate of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(o) by Parent, by notice to the Company, if (i) the Company has breached any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation in this Agreement,
(ii) such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following a
written notification thereof; provided, however, that if, at the end of such
thirty (30) day period, the Company is endeavoring in good faith, and
proceeding diligently, to cure such breach, the Company shall have an
additional thirty (30) days in which to effect such cure and (iii) such breach
(to the extent not cured) would result in any of a (w) Company Material
Adverse Effect, (x) material adverse effect on the business of Parent taken as
a whole, (y) material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to continue to
operate the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, consistent with past practices or (z) material adverse effect on the
ability of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement;

(p) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, (i) immediately if Parent has
breached its obligation to pay any amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Article 2, or (ii) if Parent



49

 breached in any material respect any other representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation in this Agreement and such breach has not been cured
within thirty (30) days following a written notification thereof; provided,
however, that if, at the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent is
endeavoring in good faith, and proceeding diligently, to cure such breach,
Parent shall have an additional thirty (30) days in which to effect such cure;
or

(q) by either of the Company or Parent if any injunction or other order having
the effect set forth in Section 6.1(g) shall be in effect and shall have
become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available to a party if

ARTICLE 8. 

INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

Section 8.1 Expiration of Representations, Etc. All representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement and any covenants of the
Company set forth in this Agreement and required to be performed prior to or
at the Closing, shall terminate and expire on, and shall cease to have any
further force or effect following, the date which is 16 months from the date
of this Agreement (the "Expiration Date"); provided, however, that if at any
time prior to the Expiration Date, Parent has duly delivered to the
Shareholders' Representative and the Escrow Agent a valid Notice of
Indemnification Claim (satisfying the requirements set forth in Section 8.8(a)
with respect to the applicable representations and warranties or covenants of
the Company), then the specific Indemnification Claim asserted in such Notice
of Indemnification Claim shall survive the Expiration Date until such time as
such claim is resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all covenants contained
in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed following the
Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.

Section 8.2 Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time (but subject to
Section 8.1, Section 8.3, Section 8.4 and Section 8.5 and the other provisions
of this Article 8), Parent shall be entitled to be indemnified against (a) any
Damages actually incurred by Parent as a direct result of any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 3 of
this Agreement, (b) any Damages actually incurred by Parent as a direct result
of any breach of any of the covenants of the Company, (c) the excess, if any,
of the aggregate amount ultimately required to be paid to holders of
Dissenting Shares with respect thereto by the Company pursuant to dissenters
rights under the ACC over the aggregate amount such holders would have
otherwise received with respect to such Dissenting Shares, plus any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Parent or



50

 the Surviving Corporation arising out of any demands for such dissenters'
rights and (d) all Indemnified Taxes. For purposes of this Article 8,
"Damages" means out-of-pocket losses or damages, but excluding any special,
indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages.

Section 8.3 Certain Limitations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article 8:

(a) Parent's indemnification rights under this Agreement shall be limited to
the amount, if any, then remaining in the Escrow Fund.

(b) Notwithstanding the fact that Parent may have the right to assert claims
for indemnification under or in respect of more than one provision of this
Agreement in respect to any fact, event, condition or circumstance, Parent
shall not be entitled to recover the amount of any Damages more than once
under this Agreement in respect of such fact, event, condition or
circumstance, and Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification for any item
to the extent that the amount of the Damages incurred with respect to such
item has been taken into account in the calculation of either the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital or Final Closing Net Working Capital, or Parent
has otherwise been fully compensated on a dollar-for-dollar basis for such
Damages pursuant to either of the Closing Net Working Capital adjustments set
forth in Section 2.8.

(c) Notwithstanding any other terms of this Article 8, Parent shall have no
right to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to any material
inaccuracy in any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in
Article 3 of this Agreement if Parent has Knowledge on the date hereof that
such representation and warranty is inaccurate as of the date hereof.

Section 8.4 Limitations on Liability.

(d) No current or former shareholder, optionholder, director, officer,
employee, Affiliate or advisor of the Company shall have any personal or
individual liability of any nature to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate of Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in, or any
other breach of, this Agreement, except as specifically provided herein.

(e) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation set forth in this
Article 8, the indemnification provided for herein shall not apply, and Parent
shall not be entitled to exercise any indemnification rights under this
Agreement, except to the extent that the aggregate amount of the Damages
against which Parent would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified exceeds
$850,000. If the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds $850,000, then
Parent shall, subject to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, be
entitled to be indemnified only against the portion of such Damages in excess
of $850,000.

(f) Parent acknowledges that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties, products, prospects, employees
and projected operations of the Company and, in making



51

 its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent is relying and has relied only on the results of its own
independent investigation and verification and the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article 3.
Parent acknowledges that, except as expressly provided in Article 3, Parent is
not relying and has not relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied. The
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 3
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties to Parent in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent
understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied (including any
representations or warranties relating to the future or historical financial
condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Company or the
quality, quantity or condition of the assets of the Company) are specifically
disclaimed by the Company. Parent acknowledges and agrees that no current or
former shareholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate or advisor of the
Company has made or is making any representations, warranties or commitments
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied.

(g) Nothing in this Article 8, including the limitations set forth in Section
8.3, Section 8.4 and Section 8.5, prevents Parent or Surviving Corporation
from bringing a common law action for fraud against any Person whose own fraud
has caused Parent or Surviving Corporation to incur Damages or limit the
Damages recoverable by Parent or Surviving Corporation in such common law
action, provided that neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to recover Damages more than once for the same indemnifiable matter.

Section 8.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims. Promptly (and in no event more than
five Business Days) after Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation receives notice or otherwise obtains
knowledge of any actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding that has been or may be brought,
commenced or asserted by a third party against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of Parent's other Affiliates and that may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim by Parent under this Article 8 (any such actual or
possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or
proceeding by a third party being referred to as a "Third-Party Claim"),
Parent shall deliver to the Shareholders' Representative a written notice
stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim
and the dollar amount of such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known. The
timely delivery of such written notice by Parent to the Shareholders'
Representative shall be a condition precedent to Parent's right to receive
indemnification payments from the Escrow Fund with respect to such Third-Party
Claim or with respect to any of the facts or circumstances giving rise to such
Third-Party Claim only to the extent the failure to timely deliver such notice
materially prejudices the Shareholders' Representative's ability to defend
such Third-Party Claim. The Shareholders' Representative shall have the right,
at its option, within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of Parent's
written notice to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim with its
own counsel. If the Shareholders' Representative elects to assume the defense
of any such Third-Party Claim, then:

(e) Parent shall be entitled to monitor (but not control) such defense (and
Parent shall not admit, and shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation does
not admit, any liability with



52

 respect to such Third-Party Claim), provided that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not be entitled to be
indemnified (from the Escrow Fund or otherwise) for any costs or expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim
following the Shareholders' Representative's election to assume the defense of
such Third-Party Claim so long as the Shareholders' Representative continues
to diligently defend such Third-Party Claim to a final, non-appealable
decision or settlement of the same;

(f) Parent shall make available to the Shareholders' Representative all books,
records and other documents and materials that are under the direct or
indirect control of Parent or any of Parent's Affiliates and that the
Shareholders' Representative reasonably considers necessary or desirable for
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, shall execute such documents and take
such other actions as the Shareholders' Representative may reasonably request
for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise
or adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim, and shall otherwise
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Shareholders' Representative in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; and

(g) the Shareholders' Representative shall not enter into any settlement
agreement providing for the settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

If the Shareholders' Representative elects not to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, then Parent shall proceed diligently to defend such Third-
Party Claim with the assistance of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Shareholders' Representative; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, adjust or compromise such Third-Party
Claim, or admit any liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim, without
the prior written consent of the Shareholders' Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 8.6 Mitigation; Insurance.

(g) Promptly after Parent or the Surviving Corporation becomes aware of any
event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Article 3, Parent or
Surviving Corporation will take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate and
minimize any Damages that may result from such breach.

(h) The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification out of the
Escrow Fund or otherwise under this Article 8 shall be calculated net of the
amount of (i) any third-party insurance proceeds from any third party
insurance paid or certain of payment to Parent or Surviving Corporation in
connection with such Damages or any of the events or circumstances giving rise
or otherwise related to such Damages, and (ii) any federal, state or local Tax
savings attributable to such Damages that are actually recognized by Parent in
the taxable year in which such Damages are calculated and paid. Nothing in
this Section 8.6 shall obligate Parent to provide copies of its or its
Affiliates' Tax Returns to the Shareholders' Representative and Parent shall
be required to disclose only such information related to such Tax Returns as
is reasonably necessary to confirm the Tax savings, or lack of Tax savings,
described in this Section 8.6(b).



53

 Section 8.7 Exclusivity. Other than Damages that result from fraud by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, the right of Parent to receive
indemnification payments pursuant to this Article 8 shall be the sole and
exclusive right and remedy exercisable by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of Parent's Affiliates with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty contained in, or any other breach of, this
Agreement.

Section 8.8 Indemnification Claims; Escrow Arrangements.

(k) Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Article 8
unless it has duly delivered a written notice to the Shareholders'
Representative and the Escrow Agent (any such notice being referred to as a
"Notice of Indemnification Claim," and the claim for indemnification described
in such Notice of Indemnification Claim being referred to as an
"Indemnification Claim"), setting forth: (i) the specific representation and
warranty of the Company alleged to have been inaccurate or specific covenant
of the Company alleged to have been breached or other specific circumstance
entitling Parent to such indemnification; (ii) a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged
inaccuracy in such representation and warranty or breach of such covenant or
other specific circumstance entitling Parent to such indemnification; and
(iii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Damages that have been incurred by
Parent as a direct result of the inaccuracy or breach or other circumstance
referred to in such notice (the aggregate amount of such estimate being
referred to as the "Claimed Amount").

(l) During the 60-day period commencing upon the receipt by the Shareholders'
Representative of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the Shareholders'
Representative may deliver to Parent and the Escrow Agent a written response
(the "Response Notice") in which the Shareholders' Representative: (i) agrees
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Parent; (ii) agrees that part (but not
all) of the Claimed Amount is owed to Parent; or (iii) asserts that no part of
the Claimed Amount is owed to Parent. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is
not agreed by the Shareholders' Representative to be owed to Parent in the
Response Notice shall be referred to as the "Contested Amount."

(m) If the Shareholders' Representative delivers a Response Notice to Parent
agreeing that all or any part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Parent, then,
within three days following the receipt of such Response Notice by Parent,
Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall jointly execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release
such amount agreed to by the Shareholders' Representative (or such lesser
amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund) to Parent from the Escrow Fund by the
release of shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Closing Price)
held in the Escrow Fund to Parent. If the Shareholders' Representative fails
to deliver a Response Notice within 60 days after its receipt of a Notice of
Indemnification Claim, the Escrow Agent shall release to Parent such portion
of the Claimed Amount as Parent shall have certified in writing to the Escrow
Agent as having been actually incurred by Parent prior to such date by the
release of shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Closing Price)
held in the Escrow Fund to Parent.

(n) If the Shareholders' Representative and Parent are unable to resolve any
dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the 30-day period commencing
upon the receipt



54

 of the Response Notice by Parent, then such dispute will be resolved in
accordance with Section 9.5.

(o) If the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund, including any
interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon (other than Shareholder
Distributions), as of the Expiration Date (the "Aggregate Escrow Balance")
exceeds the aggregate dollar amount, as of the Expiration Date, of the
Contested Amounts associated with all Indemnification Claims that have not
been finally resolved and paid prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with
this Section 8.8 (each, an "Unresolved Escrow Claim," and the aggregate dollar
amount of such Contested Amounts as of the Expiration Date being referred to
as the "Aggregate Pending Claim Amount"), then the Escrow Agent shall release
from the Escrow Fund to each Escrow Participant the amount determined by
multiplying such Escrow Participant's Escrow Participation Percentage by the
Aggregate Distribution Amount, in the form of Stock Consideration valued in
the same fashion as Stock Consideration paid by Parent to each Company
Shareholder at the Closing. For purposes of this Section 8.8, the "Aggregate
Distribution Amount" shall be the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of the
Expiration Date minus the Aggregate Pending Claim Amount.

(p) Following the Expiration Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is finally
resolved, Parent and the Shareholders' Representative shall jointly execute
and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days after the final resolution
of such Unresolved Escrow Claim, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent
to release from the Escrow Fund to each Escrow Participant an aggregate amount
of Stock Consideration determined by multiplying such Escrow Participant's
Escrow Participation Percentage by the amount (if any) by which the aggregate
amount remaining in the Escrow Fund, including any interest accrued or income
otherwise earned thereon, as of the date of resolution of such Unresolved
Escrow Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the Contested Amounts associated
with all other remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims, payable in the form of
Stock Consideration valued in the same fashion as Stock Consideration paid by
Parent to each Company Shareholder at the Closing.

(q) The parties agree that any amounts released to Parent from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to this Article 8 shall be treated as a reduction in the aggregate
consideration paid or to be paid to the Company Shareholders in connection
with the Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties further
acknowledge and agree that a portion of any amounts released to the Escrow
Participants pursuant to this Article 8 and the Escrow Agreement will be
treated as imputed interest for federal income Tax purposes (and corresponding
provisions of state, local and foreign Tax law).

ARTICLE 9. 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

Section 9.1 Shareholders' Representative.

(d) The rights of the Escrow Participants to receive disbursements from the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be subject to the right of
William A. Corbus (the "Shareholders' Representative") to take any and all
actions and make any and all decisions



55

 required or permitted to be taken or made by the Shareholders' Representative
under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the
right to: (i) give and receive notices and communications under Article 8 or
the Escrow Agreement; (ii) authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims for indemnification made by
Parent under Article 8; (iii) object to claims for indemnification made by
Parent under Article 8; (iv) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of and comply with court orders with respect to claims for
indemnification made by Parent under Article 8; (v) undertake any defense of
Third-Party Claims; (vi) amend or waive the Escrow Agreement and (vii) take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of the
Shareholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
identity of the Shareholders' Representative may be changed, and a successor
Shareholders' Representative may be appointed, from time to time (including in
the event of the resignation or the death, disability or other incapacity of
the Shareholders' Representative) by Escrow Participants whose aggregate
Escrow Participation Percentages exceed sixty percent (60%), and any such
successor shall succeed the Shareholders' Representative as Shareholders'
Representative hereunder. No bond shall be required of the Shareholders'
Representative, and the Shareholders' Representative shall be reimbursed for
costs and expenses (including overhead expenses) incurred in such capacity
from the Representative Reimbursement Amount. From and after the Effective
Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders'
Representative shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Escrow
Participant.

(e) At the Closing, Parent shall make a cash payment to the Shareholders'
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Shareholders' Representative prior to the Closing Date, in
the amount of $500,000 (the "Representative Reimbursement Amount"). The
Representative Reimbursement Amount shall be held by the Shareholders'
Representative for reimbursement payable to the Shareholders' Representative
under this Section 9.1 (the "Representative Reimbursement Fund"). Parent and
Merger Sub shall have no further obligation or liability with respect to the
Representative Reimbursement Amount other than payment of the same to the
Shareholders' Representative pursuant to this Section 9.1(b). Any portion of
the Representative Reimbursement Fund that has not been utilized by the
Shareholders' Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on or
prior to the date specified by the Shareholders' Representative on or after
the Expiration Date, shall be paid by the Shareholders' Representative to the
Escrow Agent for distribution to the Escrow Participants pro rata in
accordance with their respective Escrow Participation Percentages.

(f) The Shareholders' Representative shall not be liable for any liability,
loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred without gross negligence
by the Shareholders' Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of its good faith judgment and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties or the exercise of its rights
hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith).

(g) The Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to deduct and recover
from any amounts payable to the Escrow Participants pursuant to this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Shareholders' Representative in connection with actions taken by the
Shareholders' Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the



56

 Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of
legal fees and costs), after the Representative Reimbursement Fund has been
exhausted.

(h) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly afford to the Shareholders' Representative reasonable access to
the books, records (including accountants' work papers) and employees of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the extent reasonably determined by
the Shareholders' Representative to be necessary to permit it to investigate
or determine any matter relating to (i) its rights or obligations or the
rights or obligations of the Escrow Participants under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, or (ii) the rights or obligations (under any law or
otherwise) of the Escrow Participants with respect to any period ending on or
before the date of this Agreement. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
the Shareholders' Representative, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall, for a period of four years after the date of this Agreement, destroy,
alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Surviving
Corporation relating in whole or in part to any period prior to the date of
this Agreement without first offering to surrender to the Shareholders'
Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may intend to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose
of.

(i) Parent may rely and shall be protected in acting, or refraining from
acting, upon any written notice, instruction or request furnished to it
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement and reasonably believed by Parent to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the Shareholders'
Representative as if such written notice, instruction or request had been
furnished to it by all the Escrow Participants.

(j) Parent hereby consents to the retention by the Shareholders'
Representative of Morrison and Foerster LLP as counsel following the Closing,
notwithstanding that Morrison and Foerster LLP has represented Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
negotiation of this Agreement, and waives any right Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may have to object to such representation.

Section 9.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party shall
pay all of its own fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and
expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other
representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses)
incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated by this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, except that filing fees pursuant to any Antitrust Laws
(including the HSR Act) shall be paid by Parent. All fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be paid by Parent.

Section 9.3 Waiver.

(h) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no failure on the part of
any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of
such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of



57

 any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.

(i) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

Section 9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts; Exchanges by Facsimile. This
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
agreements referred to in this Agreement constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and
the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf
format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 9.5 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes between the parties under
or related to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its
execution, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within such State, without
regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application of
any law other than the law of the State of New York; provided, however, all
disputes between the parties under or related to Article 2 of this Agreement,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Alaska applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within such State, without regard to conflict of law principles that would
result in the application of any law other than the law of the State of
Alaska. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state court, or Federal court of the United
States of America located within San Francisco, California, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts; (b) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such court; and (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in Section 9.7. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of
any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable law.



58

 Section 9.6 Assignability; Third Party Rights.

(a) Subject to Section 9.6(b), this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall
be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations of any party hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written consent of the
other parties, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this Agreement or
any of such rights or obligations by any party without the other parties'
prior written consent shall be void and of no effect.

(b) Except as set forth in the final sentence of this Section 9.6, nothing in
this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement (but without limiting any of the rights of the
Shareholders' Representative under this Agreement): (i) the Persons who hold
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in Article 2; (ii)
the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions
set forth in Section 5.8; and (iii) all current and former shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and advisors of the Company shall
be third party beneficiaries of the last sentence of Section 8.4(c).

Section 9.7 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly

Section 9.8 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term



60

 or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

Section 9.9 Construction.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders.

(h) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(i) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Articles," "Sections," "Exhibits" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Articles or Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits or Schedules to this
Agreement.

(j) The bold-faced headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall
not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement.

Section 9.10 Attorney-Client Privilege. The attorney-client privilege of the
Company related to the Merger shall be deemed to be the right of the Escrow
Participants, and not that of the Surviving Corporation, following the
Closing, and may be waived only by the Shareholders' Representative. Absent
the consent of the Shareholders' Representative, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have a right to access attorney-client privileged
material of the Company related to the Merger following the Closing.

Section 9.11 Disclosure Schedule. The representations and warranties contained
in Article 3 of the Agreement are subject to (a) the exceptions and
disclosures set forth in the applicable Section of the Disclosure Schedule
corresponding to the particular Section of Article 3 in which such
representation and warranty appears; (b) any exceptions or disclosures
explicitly cross-referenced in such Section of the Disclosure Schedule by
reference to another Section of the Disclosure Schedule; and (c) any exception
or disclosure set forth in any other Section of the Disclosure Schedule to the
extent it is reasonably apparent that such exception or disclosure is intended
to qualify such representation and warranty. No reference to or disclosure of
any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall
it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule. The information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule is
disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information set
forth therein shall be deemed to be an



61

 admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever,
including of any violation of law or breach of any agreement. The Disclosure
Schedule and the information and disclosures contained therein are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule is
intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters reflected in the Disclosure
Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to
be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth
for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. The contents of each of the contracts and other instruments or
documents referred to in the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
incorporated and referred to in the Disclosure Schedule as though set forth in
full therein. From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company may at its
option supplement or amend and deliver updates to the Disclosure Schedule
(each a "Schedule Update") that are necessary to complete or correct any
information in the Disclosure Schedules or in any representation or warranty
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that has been rendered inaccurate or
incomplete due to any change, event, effect or occurrence since the date of
this Agreement. If Parent has the right to initiate the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) (subject to the Company's right to cure)
and does not initiate such right in writing as a result of such Schedule
Update within ten (10) days of receipt of such Schedule Update and (b) the
Schedule Update pursuant to this Section 9.11 relates to events occurring or
conditions arising after the date of this Agreement, then such Schedule Update
shall be deemed to have amended the appropriate Section or Sections of the
Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement, to have qualified the
representations and warranties contained in Article 3 as of the date of this
Agreement, and to have timely cured any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of the
existence of such matter. If Parent does not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) because no Company Material Adverse
Effect has resulted from any change, event, effect or occurrence since the
date of this Agreement, then such Schedule Update shall be deemed to
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule for the purpose of determining
whether the conditions set forth in Article 6 have been satisfied, but shall
not be deemed to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule for the purposes
of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement or the indemnification provisions of Article 8. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement and it shall not otherwise be deemed a breach of this Agreement as a
result of any Schedule Updates that relate to any actions permitted by or
taken pursuant to this Section 9.11.

Section 9.12 Specific Performance. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
parties agrees that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the other
parties will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action
or proceeding instituted in any court of the United States or any state
thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in addition to any
other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party
further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in
respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that
a remedy



62

 at law would be adequate. Further, each party agrees that in any action for
specific performance brought to enforce a party's obligations under this
agreement, if specific performance or other equitable relief is granted, the
party obtaining such remedy or relief shall be entitled to be reimbursed for
its reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such action, including its
attorney's fees and expenses.
