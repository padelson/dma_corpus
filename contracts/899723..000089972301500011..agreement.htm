HEADS OF AGREEMENT  
--- 
  

   
  

   
  

THIS HEADS OF AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made as of April 23, 2001, between OM
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("OMG"), and Ferro Corporation, an Ohio
corporation ("Ferro") (each of OMG and Ferro a "party" and together, the
"Parties").  
  

   
  

WHEREAS, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement of even date herewith ("Purchase
Agreement") among OMG, dmc2 Degussa Metals Catalysts Cerdec AG ("Seller") and
Degussa AG ("Degussa"), a copy of which is attached hereto as EXHIBIT A,
Seller will sell to OMG, and OMG will purchase from Seller, the businesses and
operations of Seller ("Transferred Businesses"); and  
  

   
  

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the closing of the transactions
contemplated under the Purchase Agreement, OMG wishes to sell, transfer and
assign to Ferro, and Ferro wishes to purchase and accept from OMG, certain of
the Transferred Businesses, including the rights and obligations of OMG under
the Purchase Agreement related to the Transferred Businesses sold to Ferro;  
  

   
  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements herein contained, the
parties agree as follows:  
  

   
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

1. |   _

Transfer of Ferro Businesses_.   
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

1.1 |   _

Transaction Structure_. The parties acknowledge that the Transferred
Businesses will be held by one or more limited partnerships or other legal
entities controlled by OMG and that Ferro wishes to acquire and to hold the
Ferro Businesses (as hereinafter defined) directly or through one or more
limited partnerships or other legal entities controlled by Ferro. Accordingly,
references to "OMG" and "Ferro" (and "party" or "parties," as appropriate)
throughout this Agreement shall include the affiliates actually holding or
intended to hold the Transferred Businesses if the context permits. The
parties further acknowledge that the transfer of the Ferro Businesses may be
effected through one or more transfers and closings (as opposed to one
transfer) (the closing of any transfer, a "Closing" and the date of any such
closing, a "Closing Date"). The parties will cooperate with each other in
effecting such multiple transfers, agreeing on tax-efficient structures for
the transfers and assignments contemplated hereunder, and entering into any
additional contracts necessary to reflect the details and specific agreements
related to each separate transaction or separate purchase agreements for the
transfer of any one or more of the "Ferro Businesses" as deemed necessary or
appropriate by the parties. Ferro will pay any taxes relating to the transfer
of Ferro Businesses, including capital gain taxes (provided that the assets
were valued at fair market value for purposes of the Purchase Agreement and
provided that the total fair market value allocated under the Purchase
Agreement to the Ferro Businesses is at least euros 600 million plus or minus
the portion of any adjustment under the Purchase Agreement allocable to the
Ferro Businesses), VAT and real estate transfer taxes.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

1.2 |   _

Ferro Businesses_. On the Closing Date, OMG shall sell and transfer to Ferro,
and Ferro shall purchase and accept from OMG, the portions of Transferred
Businesses described in EXHIBIT B hereto (each business being a "Ferro
Business" and collectively, "Ferro Businesses").  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

1.3 |   _

Rights and Obligations_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, it is
the intention of the parties that the rights and obligations obtained by OMG
with respect to each Ferro Business through the Purchase Agreement devolve to
Ferro at each Closing, by legal assignment to the extent permitted and
contemplated by Section 18 of the Purchase Agreement or by pass-through of
such rights and obligations as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, as if
the appropriate provisions of the Purchase Agreement were repeated herein, and
as if Ferro were the "Buyer" under the Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, such rights and obligations would include but not be limited to:  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(a) |  

the right to rely on the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
Section 6 of the Purchase Agreement, as if such representations and warranties
had been made directly by Seller to Ferro;  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |  

the right to rely on the indemnification rights under Section 8 (Breach of
Representations and Warranties), Section 9 (Environmental Indemnity), and
Section 10 (Contingent Liabilities) of the Purchase Agreement, as if such
indemnification rights had been granted directly by Seller to Ferro;  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(c) |  

the unfunded pension liabilities of Seller allocable to the Ferro Businesses;
and  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(d) |  

any other agreements or covenants made by, or benefits or burdens received by,
OMG with respect to the Transferred Businesses that would apply to the Ferro
Businesses, to the extent that such benefits can with OMG\'s reasonable
efforts be obtained for or provided by OMG to Ferro; likewise Ferro will use
its reasonable efforts to eliminate or ameliorate any detriments to OMG\'s
business caused by the Ferro Businesses. In the event that Ferro requests OMG
to enforce its rights under the Purchase Agreement to benefits related to the
Ferro Businesses (for example, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of
Section 25 of the Purchase Agreement), Ferro will bear OMG\'s reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses related thereto. With respect to Seller\'s duty to keep OMG
informed and supply documents under Section 12 of the Purchase Agreement, OMG
shall to the same extent keep Ferro informed from the date hereof; provided
that no documents or information shall be provided to Ferro the receipt of
which would be illegal under relevant antitrust laws or would cause OMG to
breach the Purchase Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

  |  

Ferro agrees that it will comply with any undertakings or limitations in the
Purchase Agreement to be imposed by OMG on any third party buyer of any of the
Transferred Businesses including without limitation the following:  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(a) |  

Ferro agrees that it will use the Degussa License (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) in accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 13.8 of the
Purchase Agreement; and  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |  

Ferro agrees that it will occupy the Gutleut Area (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) in accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 13.12 of the
Purchase Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

2. |   _

Purchase Price_.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

2.1 |   _

Purchase Price_. The base purchase price for the Ferro Businesses shall be
euros 600,000,000 ("Purchase Price"), allocated among the Ferro Businesses as
agreed by the parties. The Purchase Price will be converted into an obligation
to pay in US dollars based on the exchange rate published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ on the next business day following the closing under the Purchase
Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

2.2 |   _

Adjusted Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price will be adjusted as follows:  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(a) |  

The Purchase Price will be adjusted as of the closing under the Purchase
Agreement, determined consistently with the adjustment approach under the
Purchase Agreement, but in relation to the Ferro Businesses only, in a manner
to be agreed by the parties in order to reach a fair result to both OMG and
Ferro.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |  

The Purchase Price payments will be adjusted ratably downward, based on the
allocation of the Purchase Price on Exhibit B as the transfer of each Ferro
Business is closed or separately sold.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(c) |  

The Parties agree that time is of the essence to close the transactions
described in this Agreement. As an incentive, the Purchase Price will be
adjusted upward by $4,050,000 for each month from the closing under the
Purchase Agreement to the last Closing under this Agreement. The adjustment
will be prorated for any partial month and will be prorated among the Ferro
Businesses and reduced for each Ferro Business that is closed or separately
sold.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(d) |  

The Parties agree to adjust the Purchase Price according to a formula and with
limitations to be mutually agreed upon in order to share in any excess
investment banking fees and other structural costs arising from the
transaction described in this Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

  |  

OMG agrees that any purchase price allocation to be agreed between OMG and
Seller in accordance with Section 2.1 of the Purchase Agreement with respect
to the Ferro Businesses shall be subject to Ferro\'s prior approval which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

3. |   _

Representations and Warranties_. Each of OMG and Ferro represents and warrants
to the other that the following statements are true, accurate and complete as
of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date and any other party acting as
the nominee of OMG or Ferro represents to OMG or Ferro, respectively, that the
following statements are true as of the Closing Date:  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

3.1 |   _

Organization, Existence, and Standing_. It is a corporation or other specified
entity duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws
of Ohio, in the case of Ferro, or Delaware, in the case of OMG, or other
specified jurisdiction.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

3.2 |   _

Power and Authority_. In the case of OMG and Ferro, it has full corporate
power, authority, and legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations under this Agreement. Upon execution and delivery by
it, this Agreement and the other instruments and agreements for which
provision is made herein will (assuming the valid execution and delivery by
the other party of this Agreement and the other instruments and agreements for
which provision is made herein) constitute a valid and binding obligation of
it enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors\'
rights generally or by general equitable principles (whether considered at law
or in equity). In the case of a nominee of OMG or Ferro, it has the full power
and authority and legal right to execute and deliver any additional documents
contemplated under Section 1 hereof and to close the relevant transaction.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

4. |   _

Representations and Warranties_. OMG hereby makes such representations and
warranties to Ferro with respect to the Ferro Businesses as were made to OMG
by Seller in the Purchase Agreement. Ferro acknowledges that OMG is making
these representations and warranties only to the extent necessary to make
claims for indemnities or damages on behalf of Ferro under the Purchase
Agreement, and that OMG shall not itself have financial obligations to Ferro
therefor except to the extent provided in Sections 5.1 and 5.13 hereof.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5. |   _

Covenants by Parties_.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.1 |   _

Processing of Indemnity Claims_. OMG agrees that, following any Closing Date
and subject to the provisions set forth below and in the Purchase Agreement,
it will promptly submit any claims arising under representations, warranties
and indemnities under the Purchase Agreement received by OMG from Ferro in
writing and arising hereunder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 4 relating to the
Ferro Businesses then owned by Ferro to Seller and Degussa, and that it shall
pursue such claims following the necessary procedures required under law and
under the Purchase Agreement, with all reasonable effort as they apply to the
Ferro Businesses; provided that OMG will be responsible for managing such
claims from a substantive point of view only to the extent required by the
Purchase Agreement and applying the same business judgment it would apply to
itself. Otherwise, Ferro will either provide the information and assistance
needed by OMG to effectively pursue such claim or it will manage the
substantive issues itself; provided that, Ferro shall not be required to
manage any aspects of any claim, procedurally or otherwise, if its
participation would allow Seller under the Purchase Agreement to deny
responsibility for such claim on the basis that OMG has assigned its rights in
violation of the Purchase Agreement or some other technical violation of the
Purchase Agreement. OMG further agrees to cooperate with Ferro in all
reasonable ways to obtain any and all rights OMG would be entitled to under
the Purchase Agreement with respect to the Ferro Businesses. Further, OMG
shall appoint Ferro as its agent, with full authority to pursue enforcement of
OMG\'s rights under the Purchase Agreement. Each party further agrees to
provide the other party with a written notice describing the nature and amount
of any claim to be asserted against Seller or Degussa. The parties shall agree
prior to any Closing to the details of their respective roles under this
section. Any damages suffered by Ferro as a result of a breach by OMG of its
obligations under this Section 5.1 shall be limited to the amounts OMG would
have been entitled to recover under the Purchase Agreement had it not breached
its obligations under this Section 5.1.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.2 |   _

Apportionment of Basket and Cap_. The parties acknowledge that any assertion
of claims against Seller or Degussa with respect to the Transferred Businesses
retained by OMG or the Ferro Businesses is subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Purchase Agreement, which include the following limitations:
(i) any claim based on a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
may be asserted against Seller or Degussa only if the total amount of all
claims asserted exceeds the amount of euros 10,000,000 ("Basket") and only for
the amount exceeding the Basket, and (ii) except for certain claims, all
claims based upon a breach of a representation or warranty or environmental
costs or liabilities is limited to an aggregate amount of 25% of the purchase
price paid by OMG for the Transferred Businesses ("Cap"). The parties agree
that the Basket and Cap shall be apportioned between Ferro and OMG as
follows:  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(a) |  

the impact of the Basket limitation shall be equally shared by Ferro and OMG;
so that, once the Basket amount has been reached, reimbursements from Seller
shall be adjusted between OMG and Ferro until each of them has effectively
contributed euros 5,000,000 to the basket.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |  

For so long as claims for the maximum payments under the Cap have not been
made, Ferro and OMG shall have equal rights to the Cap. However, if claims
under the Purchase Agreement exceed the Cap, during the period that Seller is
obligated to pay indemnities, if either Ferro or OMG receives in excess of 50%
of the Cap, the excess shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, be deposited
in an escrow account, with terms to be agreed by OMG and Ferro, with
distribution of such excess, together with interest earned thereon, to be made
either at the end of the period to whichever of Ferro or OMG deposited the
excess or prior to the end of the term as required to reimburse the other
party as such party incurs indemnifiable expenses up to euros 150 million.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.3 |   _

Environmental Co-Pay_. Ferro and OMG each agree that the party claiming
indemnification for environmental costs or liabilities shall be required to
pay the percentage of the total claim assigned to Buyer in Section 9.3.1 of
the Purchase Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.4 |   _

Contracts and Other Rights_. OMG agrees to transfer (by way of legal
assignment if permitted or if not, by directing that the services be provided
for the relevant Ferro Business) to Ferro any intercompany service agreements
relating to the Ferro Businesses which will continue after the closing of the
Purchase Agreement in accordance with Section 13.11 of the Purchase Agreement.
OMG further agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the licensing party
to any SAP license or other material software license agreement relating to
the Ferro Businesses to consent to an assignment of such license agreement to
Ferro on any and all relevant Closing Dates. To the extent service agreements
require the cooperation of both OMG and Ferro, each will work to cause
efficient and effective results with the ultimate goal of separating the
services supplied to the individual businesses.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.5 |   _

Joint Facilities_. The parties acknowledge that some of the Transferred
Businesses will be jointly operated by OMG and Ferro following the Closing of
any Ferro Business operating in a joint facility until such time as it will be
practicable to divide these jointly operated facilities between OMG and Ferro.
The parties shall agree on how these facilities shall be operated and/or
divided after each Closing on terms and conditions mutually satisfactory to
the parties.   
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.6 |   _

Antitrust Clearance_. Ferro agrees to comply with the restrictions on Buyer
under Section 13.10 of the Purchase Agreement. To the extent allowed by such
restrictions, on or before the closing of the transactions contemplated under
the Purchase Agreement, OMG and Ferro shall each promptly file or cause to be
filed with the Antitrust Authorities (as hereinafter defined) any
notifications required under any applicable antitrust law. The parties may
agree to file such notifications on a schedule consistent with the order in
which they intend to close the transfer of each Ferro Business.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(a) |  

OMG and Ferro will assist and cooperate with each other in doing all things
necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, including (i) submitting all necessary notices and filings and (ii)
obtaining all necessary consents, approvals, or waivers as required by the
Antitrust Authorities (as hereinafter defined). The parties shall each
cooperate and use their respective best efforts to promptly provide
information and documents requested by any Antitrust Authority (including
substantially complying with any second request for information pursuant to
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act) or otherwise necessary,
proper, or advisable to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |  

OMG and Ferro also agree to promptly take any actions necessary, proper and
advisable that would not have a materially adverse effect upon either OMG or
Ferro to obtain the approval of any Antitrust Authority; provided that Ferro
does agree to: (i) enter into negotiations with the relevant Antitrust
Authority, or (ii) consent to reasonable third-party licenses or "non-
bundling" restrictions if required by the relevant Antitrust Authority, in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as expeditiously as
practicable.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(c) |  

The parties shall promptly inform each other of any material communication
from any Antitrust Authority. "Antitrust Authority(ies)" means the antitrust
authorities of the European Commission, the United States and any other
country having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated herein. If any
party hereto or any affiliate thereof receives a request for information or
documents from any Antitrust Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, then such party shall make, or cause to be
made, as soon as practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request and will make available
for review to the other party (and its counsel) advance drafts of all
presentations and filings in connection therewith. Each party shall consult
the other party in advance of proffering any understandings, undertakings, or
agreements (oral or written) that it proposes to make or enter into with any
other Antitrust Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(d) |  

If Ferro is unable to obtain the required approvals to buy any of the Ferro
Businesses, or if both Ferro and OMG agree at any time that continuation of
the process is impracticable, and if Ferro is allowed by the Antitrust
Authorities to sell such Businesses, it will do so after providing OMG a right
of first offer. If, on the other hand OMG sells such Businesses because a
transfer to Ferro is not permitted or has been abandoned as described in the
preceding sentence, such sale shall be for Ferro\'s account using an
investment banker mutually acceptable to Ferro and OMG and Ferro and OMG will
consult with each other about the appropriate sale process, and Ferro shall
reimburse OMG for any net loss compared to the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Business on Exhibit B hereto. Similarly, any net gain
received over the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Ferro
Business shall be paid to Ferro. OMG and Ferro\'s rights to make a claim for
net loss or net gain, as the case may be, and any portion remaining of the
$4,050,000 monthly addition to the Purchase Price, shall expire at the earlier
of OMG\'s decision to retain any business for its own account (as a result of
Ferro\'s inability to obtain the required approvals to buy such business) and
270 days after OMG first has the right to sell the Ferro Business for Ferro\'s
account. In the event OMG does decide to retain the business, the parties
shall consider a fair adjustment of the monthly payments of additional
purchase price, applying an offset against cash flow generated by the
particular business since the closing under the Purchase Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.7 |   _

Operation of Ferro Businesses Before Closing_. After the closing of the
Purchase Agreement and prior to any and all Closings hereunder, OMG agrees to
maintain and operate the Ferro Businesses in a manner consistent with
Seller\'s past practices, including but not limited to preserving customer,
supplier and employee relations, performing contracts, maintaining operating
assets, and other actions necessary to maintain the value of the Ferro
Businesses. OMG also agrees that it will not do any of the following without
the prior written consent of Ferro: (a) enter into any intercompany supply
arrangements not consistent with Seller\'s past practice; (b) enter into any
significant long-term or "take or pay" supply agreements; (c) incur any
capital expenditures in excess of euros 1,000,000; (d) change Seller\'s
practices used to allocate costs among the Transferred Businesses that would
affect the Ferro Businesses; (e) enter into employment, "stay-put" or special
bonus contracts or arrangements with key employees not consistent with
Seller\'s past practices; (f) declare or pay any dividend to a direct or
indirect parent or otherwise transfer any profits from the Ferro Businesses;
(g) sell or buy operating assets of the Ferro Businesses outside the normal
course of business, not consistent with past practices; (h) take any other
actions precluded by Section 14.1.2-14.1.9 of the Purchase Agreement, or (i)
waive its rights under Sections 14.1.2-14.1.9 of the Purchase Agreement. OMG
also agrees to allow Ferro to conduct reasonable environmental due diligence;
provided that such diligence shall not unreasonably interfere with the
relevant business operations. OMG also agrees to disclose to Ferro in writing
any violation of a representation, warranty or covenant under the Purchase
Agreement of which any executive officer of OMG becomes aware. The Parties
will work together to establish a separate accounting and treasury mechanism
to allow for the business results and cash flows to be tracked separately.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.8 |   _

Further Assurance_. After the Closing, OMG shall from time to time, at
Ferro\'s reasonable request, execute and deliver to Ferro such other
instruments of conveyance or assignment, and take such other actions as Ferro
may reasonably request so as to more effectively assign and deliver and vest
in Ferro title to and possession of the Ferro Businesses and to fully
implement this Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.9 |   _

Access_. Prior to the closing under the Purchase Agreement, OMG shall provide
access to the Ferro Businesses consistent with Section 14.2 of the Purchase
Agreement, and Ferro shall use such information only as permitted by Section
14.2 of the Purchase Agreement. Thereafter, prior to any Closing hereunder,
OMG shall provide senior management of Ferro and its agents (including
environmental consultants) with full access to the Ferro Businesses and to the
assets, operations, documents, books and records and information relating to
such businesses, to the extent necessary to enable Ferro to plan for effective
and efficient integration of those Businesses after they have been transferred
and shall furnish such other information as Ferro may reasonably request. All
information shall be provided pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, and
Ferro shall decline to receive any information that would be precluded under
applicable antitrust laws.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.10 |   _

Further Agreements_. OMG and Ferro acknowledge that this Agreement does not
purport to cover all legal and business issues related to the transactions
contemplated hereunder, and each agrees to negotiate and execute additional
agreements to achieve the goal of transferring the Ferro Businesses on terms
agreeable to both parties.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.11 |   _

Third-Party Consents and Approvals_. OMG shall request Seller to obtain any
necessary third party consents relating to the Ferro Businesses in accordance
with Section 6.21 of the Purchase Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.12 |   _

Obligation to Purchase_. No breach by OMG of its obligations hereunder shall
relieve Ferro from its obligation to purchase the Ferro Businesses unless such
breach is also a condition to close contained in Article 6.2 hereof.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.13 |   _

Reimbursement and Indemnity Obligations_.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(a) |  

OMG has undertaken obligations designed to provide the benefits of the
Purchase Agreement to Ferro. OMG will indemnify and hold Ferro harmless from
claims arising from OMG\'s breach of its obligations hereunder, but otherwise
shall not be liable to Ferro for the obligations of Seller under the Purchase
Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |  

Ferro, for its part, agrees to reimburse OMG for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by OMG in securing the benefits under the Purchase Agreement
for Ferro. In addition, Ferro will indemnify OMG and its affiliates from any
third-party claims against them relating to the Ferro Businesses except that
Ferro will not so indemnify OMG and its affiliates to the extent that such
claims arise from events occurring during the ownership of the Ferro
Businesses by OMG and result from a breach by OMG of its obligations under
this Agreement, including, without limitation, OMG\'s obligations under
Section 5.7.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

5.14 |   _

No Hire_. Upon the sale of each Ferro Business, OMG will agree for a period of
two (2) years after the relevant Closing Date not to hire any employee
transferred with the Ferro Business; likewise, Ferro agrees for a period of
two (2) years after it has acquired any Ferro Business not to hire any
employee of the Transferred Businesses retained by OMG.   
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

6. |   _

Conditions to Obligations of Parties_. The obligations of OMG to consummate
the transfer of each Ferro Business are subject to the satisfaction on or
prior to the Closing Date of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1. The
obligations of Ferro to consummate the transfer of each Ferro Business are

(b) |   _

Antitrust Clearance_. All authorizations, consents, orders, declarations,
approvals, filings with, or terminations or expirations of waiting periods
imposed by, any governmental entity the failure of which to obtain, make or

Business illegal or would have a material adverse effect on the transaction
for either party, shall have been obtained, shall have been made or shall have
occurred.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(c) |   _

Ferro Businesses to any other buyer except in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |   _

Antitrust Clearance_. All authorizations, consents, orders, declarations,
approvals, filings with, or terminations or expirations of waiting periods
imposed by, any governmental entity the failure of which to obtain, make or
occur would have the effect of making the transfer of the applicable Ferro
Business illegal or would have a material adverse effect on the transaction
for either party, shall have been obtained, shall have been made or shall have
occurred.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(c) |   _

Representations and Warranties True on Closing Date_. The representations and
warranties of OMG made in Section 3 of this Agreement shall be true in all
material respects as of the Closing Date as though such representations and
warranties were made as of the Closing Date.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(d) |   _

Threatened or Pending Proceedings_. No proceedings shall have been threatened
in writing or initiated (and not dismissed) by any governmental authority
seeking to enjoin or otherwise restrain the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any material respect.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(e) |   _

Material Adverse Change_. If OMG has the right to terminate the Purchase
Agreement under Section 4.3.2 thereof, and more than 50% of the adverse change
in financial condition referenced in Section 6.13.1 of the Purchase Agreement
applies to the Ferro Businesses, then Ferro shall have the right not to close
under this Agreement if (i) OMG knew prior to the closing under the Purchase
Agreement of its right to terminate the Purchase Agreement and notifies Ferro
of that right and (ii) Ferro notifies OMG prior to the closing under the
Purchase Agreement of its election not to close hereunder; provided that for
purposes of this condition, business trends of the Ferro Businesses at no
worse levels than known to Ferro at the date hereof shall not provide a basis
for a claim by Ferro that a Material Adverse Change has occurred.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

7. |   _

Closing_.  
  

  |  

  |

agree in writing.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

7.2 |   _

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |

applicable law;  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

(b) |   _

Certificates._ Good standing, tax and other customary certificates or similar

as well as incumbency certificates of both OMG and Ferro.

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

7.3 |   _

Breakup Fee_. If the Purchase Agreement does not close for any reason, and if
OMG receives a "breakup fee" related thereto, OMG shall pay Ferro 50% of such
fee.  
  

  |  

  |  

   
  

  |  

8. |   _

Termination_. If the parties are unable to obtain antitrust clearance within
seven months after the filing in jurisdictions that require mandatory
government pre-clearance notification processes of notices relating to a Ferro
Business to be transferred, then either party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to such business by giving written
notice to the other party. For 90 days after either party has received such
written notice, Ferro shall have the right to sell the Ferro Business. If
Ferro is unsuccessful, OMG shall have the right to sell the Ferro Business. If
a sale is executed in either case, the economic adjustment required by Section
5.6(d) hereof shall apply. In the event of any such termination, this
Agreement will become void and of no further force and effect with respect to
such business and no party hereto will have any liability to any other party
hereunder (other than as provided in this Section 8), with respect to such
Ferro Business. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to any Ferro Businesses previously transferred to Ferro. In the event
Ferro does not purchase any Ferro Business, Ferro agrees to keep confidential
any information received in relation to such business in accordance with its
confidentiality agreements with Degussa and/or Seller.
