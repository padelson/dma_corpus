of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file
a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all
other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time")
as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State or at such later time as agreed to by the Company and the Parent and as
is specified in the certificate of merger.   (c) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights,
powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger
Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.   Section 2.02.

or at such other time or place as Parent and the Company may agree; provided
that the consummation of the Merger shall not take place prior to January 31,
2005, without the prior written consent of Parent.     12    Section
2.03. Conversion Of Shares. At the Effective Time:   (a) except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.03(b), Section 2.03(c)  or Section 2.05, each Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be converted into
the right to receive $28.00 in cash, without  interest (the "Merger
Consideration");   (b) each Share held by the Company as treasury stock
(other than  Shares, if any, in an Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by
Parent or  any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be  canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;  
(c) each Share held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding; and   (d)
each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become  one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same  rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall  constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation.  
Section 2.04. Surrender And Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall appoint an agent, subject to Parent\'s approval of the terms
and conditions of such appointment (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld), which shall be the Company\'s transfer agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated
Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount in immediately available funds
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.   (b) Each holder of Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(ii) receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger
Consideration payable for each Share represented by a Certificate or for each
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be,     13   each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration.   (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 2.   (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) (and any interest or
other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares
six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.   (f) Any portion of the Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a)
to pay for Shares, for which appraisal rights have been perfected and have
not been withdrawn or lost 30 days after the Effective Time, shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.   Section 2.05. Dissenting Shares.
Notwithstanding Section 2.03, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the    
14   Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the
right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.   Section 2.06. Stock Options. At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each employee and director stock option to purchase Shares
outstanding under any stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be canceled, and the
Company shall pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the
Effective Time for each such option surrendered an amount in cash determined
by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of Shares such
holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had such
holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents from holders of
options to purchase Shares granted under the Company\'s stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements and make any amendments to the terms of
such stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that, in the case of
either clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.06(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section, payment may be withheld in respect of any employee stock option
until such necessary consents are obtained.   Section 2.07. Adjustments.
If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur, including by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination or
exchange of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during such
period or issuer tender or exchange offer or similar transaction (excluding
any such change as a result of any exercise of options outstanding as of the
date hereof to purchase Shares granted under the Company\'s stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements), the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
appropriately adjusted.   Section 2.08. Withholding Rights. Each of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the    
15   Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.   Section 2.09. Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.   ARTICLE 3  THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION   Section 3.01. Merger Subsidiary. At its election, Parent may
substitute any of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Delaware subsidiaries
for Merger Subsidiary as a constituent corporation in the Merger. In such an
event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement in order to reflect such substitution.   Section 3.02.
Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of the Company
in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable
law.   Section 3.03. Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable law.   Section 3.04. Directors and
Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law, (a) the
directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of the Company at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation (other than
the Chairman, who shall be appointed by the directors of the Surviving
Corporation).   ARTICLE 4  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this

Company of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any

or Liens referred to in clauses (c) and (d) that would be reasonably expected
not to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.   Section 4.05. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000 Shares and 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company. As of November 30, 2004,
there were outstanding 32,225,830 Shares and employee and director stock

Company is a corporation or limited liability company duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
formation, has all corporate or limited liability company powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of
which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All

securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of or other voting securities or

rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital

voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company
(the items in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to collectively as the
"Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Subsidiary Securities.   Section 4.07. SEC Filings and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (a) (i) The Company\'s annual reports on Form 10-K
for its fiscal years ended March 31,     19   2002, 2003 and 2004, (ii)
its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarters ending June 30,

relating to meetings of the stockholders of the Company held (or actions
taken without a meeting by such stockholders) since March 31, 2004, (iv)the
Company\'s registration statement filed with the SEC on October 2, 2003, and
(v) all of its other reports, statements, schedules and

reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits, material agreements and other information incorporated therein)
required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since March 31, 2002.  
(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superceded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC
Document complied, and each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may
be.   (c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superceded by a filing
prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC
Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each such Company SEC
Document filed subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.   (d) Each registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
1933 Act since March 31, 2002, as of the date such statement or amendment
became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.   (e) The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the 1934 Act are being prepared. Except as disclosed
in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.   (f) The Company and its
Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act) ("internal
controls"). Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof, such internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Company\'s    20   financial
reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to
the date hereof, to the Company\'s auditors and audit committee (x)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company\'s internal control over financial reporting. The Company\'s
quarterly report for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 filed on
Form 10-Q includes a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Company\'s auditors and audit committee since March 31, 2003.   (g) There
are no outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or
director of the Company. The Company has not since the enactment of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   Section 4.08. Financial Statements. The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents
fairly present, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).   Section 4.09. Disclosure Documents. (a) Each document
required to be filed by the Company with the SEC or required to be
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Documents"), including the proxy or information statement of the
Company (the "Company Proxy Statement"), and any amendments or supplements
thereto, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
1934 Act.   (b) The Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if
applicable, at the time such Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the
time such stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement, and any Company
Disclosure Document (other than the Company Proxy Statement), at the time of
the filing of such Company Disclosure Document or any supplement or amendment
thereto and at the time of any distribution or dissemination thereof, will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any     21   material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section
4.09 will not apply to statements or omissions included in the Company
Disclosure Documents based upon information furnished to the Company in
writing by Parent and its Affiliates specifically for use therein.

Sheet Date, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than transactions and commitments in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and, after the
date hereof, to the extent not prohibited by this Agreement and contemplated
by this Agreement;   (i) any change in any method of accounting or
accounting principles or practice by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

to the Knowledge of the Company, no customer which individually and with its
Affiliates accounted for more than $2,500,000 in revenues of the Company and
its Subsidiaries during the six months ended September 30, 2004 is reasonably
likely to decrease its purchases by more than 25% in revenues of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the 12-month period following the date hereof (not
including any decrease as a result of currency fluctutions). As of the date
hereof, no supplier of the Company or its Subsidiaries to whom the Company or
its Subsidiaries made aggregate payments in excess of $10,000,000 in the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 or a single source supplier to the Company
or its Subsidiaries (in each case, a "Major Supplier") has indicated to the
Company or its Subsidiaries that it will stop, or decrease the rate of,
supplying materials, products or services to the Company or its Subsidiaries.
In the event an agreement with a Major Supplier would expire or terminate in
accordance with its terms within the next 18 months, the Company is able to
either renew such agreement or obtain similar products covered by such
agreement from alternative sources under substantially similar terms, except
where the failure to renew or obtain would not be reasonably expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has knowingly breached any agreement with, or engaged in any
fraudulent conduct with respect to, any supplier of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.   Section 4.12. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are
no liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise ("Liabilities"), other than:   (a) Liabilities
disclosed and provided for in the Company Balance  Sheet or in the notes
thereto or in the Company SEC Documents filed prior  to the date hereof,
and   (b) Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent  with past practices that would reasonably be expected not
to     24    have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the  Company.   Section 4.13. Compliance with Laws and Court
Orders. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is and has been in
compliance with, and to the Knowledge of the Company is not under
investigation with respect to and has not been threatened to be charged with
or given notice of any violation of, any applicable law, except for failures
to comply or violations that have not had and would reasonably be expected
not to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.   Section 4.14. Permits. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,
certificates, registrations, approvals and clearances of any governmental
authority, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with any
governmental authority necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own,
lease and/or operate its properties or other assets under local law (whether
in the United States of America or elsewhere), or to carry on its business in
the manner as presently conducted, including, the testing, manufacturing,
storing, packaging, labeling and distributing of any product of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Permits"), and all such Company
Permits are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the failure to
have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full
force and effect of, any of the Company Permits, or the failure to have made
such filings, applications and/or registrations, have not had and would
reasonably be expected not to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   Section 4.15. Litigation. There is
no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting, the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person for whom the
Company or any of such Subsidiary may be liable or any of their respective
properties before any court or arbitrator or before or by any governmental
body, agency or official, domestic, foreign or supranational, that, if
determined or resolved adversely in accordance with the plaintiff\'s demands,
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or that, as of the date hereof, in
any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.   Section
4.16. Company Material Contracts. (a) Except as disclosed in Section 4.16(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by:   (i) except for any acquisition
agreement entered into after the date  hereof permitted Section 6.01(b), any
agreement for the purchase of  materials, supplies, goods, services,
equipment or other assets (other than    25    freight orders or

its Subsidiaries of $500,000 or more or (b) aggregate  payments by the

distribution or other similar agreement providing for  the sale by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of materials, supplies,  goods, services,

similar agreement or  arrangement;   (v) except any acquisition agreement
entered into after the date  hereof permitted by Section 6.01(b), any
agreement relating to the  acquisition or disposition of any business
(whether by merger, sale of  stock, sale of assets or otherwise) entered into
by the Company in the past  three years or, if entered into by the Company
more than three years ago,  under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries still has an outstanding  Liability;   (vi) any franchise or
similar agreement;   (vii) any agency, dealer, sales representative,

Company. True and complete copies of each such agreement, contract, plan,
lease, arrangement or commitment have been delivered to the Parent.

industry (giving due account to the age and length of use of same, ordinary
wear and tear excepted), are adequate and suitable for their present and
intended uses and, in the case of plants, buildings and other structures
(including the roofs thereof), are structurally sound.   Section 4.20.
Finders\' Fees. Except for UBS Securities LLC, a copy of whose engagement
agreement has been provided to Parent, and the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by the Company on or prior to the Effective Time, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been

reference to the activities of any other Person, and (iii) liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the payment of any amount as a result

or other information or filing required to be supplied to any Taxing

4.23(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete
list identifying each material Employee Plan (including, without limitation,
each employment, severance or other agreement with any executive officer or
other key employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or a summary
thereof. Copies of such plans or summaries (and, if applicable, related trust
or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto have
been furnished to Parent together with the most recent annual report (Form
5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto), if any, and tax return
(Form 990), if any, prepared in connection with each such plan or trust.  
(b) Section 4.23(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the most recent
actuarial report for each Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (other
than a "multiemployer plan," as defined below) (a "Title IV Plan"), a copy of
which has been provided to Parent. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has
been no event which could reasonably be expected to result in a material
change in the funded status of any such Employee Plan since the date
of valuation reflected in such report. No "accumulated funding deficiency,"
as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with respect to
any Employee Plan subject to such Section 412, whether or not waived. No
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, other than a
"reportable event" that will not have, and would be reasonably expected not
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and no event described in
Section 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred in connection with any Title IV
Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company has (i)
engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an entity that has
engaged in, a transaction described in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or
(ii) incurred, or reasonably expects to incur prior to the Effective Time,
(A) any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the
termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or
previously covered by Title IV of ERISA or (B) any liability under Section
4971 of the Code that in either case could become a liability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates after the
Effective Time.   (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any
predecessor thereof contributes to, or has in the past contributed to, any
multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer
Plan").     30    (d) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file,
an application for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and
the Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter
should be revoked or not be issued. The Company has made available to Parent
copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with
respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in
material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. No material events have
occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or
assessment by or against the Company of any material excise taxes under
Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the
Code.   (e) The consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not (either alone or together with any other event)
entitle any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation, benefits, grants or awards under, increase the amount payable
or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan.
There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or collectively, would entitle any employee or former employee
to any severance or other payment, benefit or accelerated vesting of any
benefit, grant or award contingent upon the transactions contemplated hereby
which is reasonably expected to give rise to the amounts that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.   (f) Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in respect of post-
retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or
current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries except as required to
avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.   (g) There has been no
amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written)
by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of
the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2004.   (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or subject to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into,
any collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a
labor union or organization.     31    (i) All contributions and
payments accrued under each Employee Plan, determined in accordance with
prior funding and accrual practices, have been discharged and paid on or
prior to the date hereof except to the extent reflected as a liability on the
Company Balance Sheet.   (j) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit
or proceeding pending against or involving or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan or Employee Plan
administrator or fiduciary before any court or arbitrator or any state,
federal or local governmental body, agency or official.   (k) Section
4.23(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete
list identifying each material International Plan or a summary thereof. Each
International Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance with its
terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations (including any special
provisions relating to qualification or registration) and has been maintained
in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. There has been no
amendment to or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any amendment to any International Plan that is reasonably
expected to increase materially the expense of maintaining such International
Plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most
recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof. With respect to the
International Plans which provide for payment of pension, severance,
termination indemnity, retirement or other post-retirement or post-employment
benefits (collectively, "Post-Employment Benefits"), the liabilities under
all such International Plans (as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP
using reasonable rates and assumptions) are accurately reflected in the
Company\'s financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004
contained in the Company 10-K. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has
been no event which could reasonably be expected to result in a
material change in the funded status of any such International Plan since
March 31, 2004, or, if an actuarial report exists, the date of valuation
reflected in each such report. Assuming a termination as of the Effective
Time of employment of all employees of the Company working in Mexico, the
costs and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Post-
Employment Benefits for all such employees on and after such termination
would not exceed $1,000,000. The consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together with
any other event) will not entitle any current or former employee, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation, benefits,
grants or awards under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other
material obligation pursuant to, any International Plan. No notice,
notification or other announcement is required to be given under
any International Plan to any current or former employee, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result
of the transactions     32   contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or together with any other event). From and after the Effective Time,
Parent and its Affiliates will get the full benefit of any funds, accruals or
reserves under such International Plans.   Section 4.24. Environmental
Matters. (a) Except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof and except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company:   (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for information, 
citation, summons, complaint or order has been received, no penalty has  been
assessed, and no action, claim, suit or proceeding is pending and none  of
them and no investigation is, to the Knowledge of the Company,  threatened,
by any governmental entity or other Person alleging liability  of the Company
or any Subsidiary under, or violation by the Company or any  of its
Subsidiaries of, any Environmental Law;   (ii) the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all  applicable Environmental Laws and
all Environmental Permits; and   (iii) there are no events, conditions or
activities that would  reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis
for any liability of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Environmental Law.   (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
currently  conducting any response or other corrective action, including
under or  pursuant to any voluntary action or third party claim, at any site
under  any Environmental Law.   (b) There is no material written
investigation, study, audit, test, or other analysis conducted which is in
the possession of the Company regarding the current or prior business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any property or facility now or previously owned or
leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries addressing actual or
potential liability of the Company or any Subsidiary under, or any violation
by the Company or any Subsidiary of, any Environmental Law that has not been
made available to Parent at least five Business Days prior to the date
hereof.   Section 4.25. Intellectual Property. (a) The Company and its
Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other rights to use all
Intellectual Property Rights necessary to conduct the business as currently
conducted, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses or rights
has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any other Person, except for such infringements, misappropriations
or violations that, individually or in the     33   aggregate, would
not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No
Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property Right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
infringements, misappropriations or violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.   (b) Section 4.25(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and complete list as of the date hereof of all
patents and patent applications, registered copyrights and copyright
applications, registered trademarks and trademark applications that is the
subject of an application, certificate, filing, registration or other
document issued by, filed with, or recorded by, any private, state,
government or other public legal authority owned by or registered to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, specifying as to each such Intellectual
Property Right, as applicable, (i) the owner of such Intellectual Property
Right, (ii) the jurisdictions by or in which such Intellectual Property Right
has been issued or registered or in which an application for such issuance or
registration has been filed and (iii) the registration or application
numbers thereof. Section 4.25(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a true and complete list of all material written agreements
(including license agreements, research agreements, development agreements,
distribution agreements, settlement agreements, consent to use agreements and
covenants not to sue, but excluding licenses for computer software that are
generally available) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise bound and granting or restricting any right to use,
exploit or practice any Intellectual Property Rights.   Section 4.26.
Antitakeover Statutes and Rights Agreement. (a) The Company has taken all
action necessary to exempt the Merger, this Agreement and the Voting and
Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from
the provisions of Section 203 of Delaware Law, and, accordingly, no such
Section nor other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation applies
or purports to apply to any such transactions. No other "control
share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other antitakeover laws
enacted under U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement and the
Voting and Support Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.   (b) The Company has taken all action necessary to render the
rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement inapplicable to
the Merger, this Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement and the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of
Section 6.04(c), the Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries, at any time prior to the adoption
and approval of the Merger by the Company\'s stockholders, may (i) engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the
Company\'s compliance with Section 6.04(a), has made a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith by
a majority vote constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, (ii) furnish to such Third Party and its auditors, advisors and
lenders nonpublic information relating to, and afford such Third Party access
to, the business properties, assets, books and records of, the Company or any

such Superior Proposal, fail to make, withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent its recommendation to its stockholders referred to in Section 6.02
hereof and/or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction

clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice from the outside legal
counsel to the Company, that it should take such action to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent
the Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that if such disclosure has
the effect of withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the recommendation to the
Company\'s stockholders referred to in Section 6.02 hereof in a manner
adverse to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the     39   approval of this
Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 10.01(c)
of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes under this
Agreement, including Article 10, any disclosure by the Board of Directors of
the status of any Acquisition Proposal (without comment on the merits
thereof) shall not be considered a failure to make, withdrawal
or modification adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its recommendation
of approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company\'s
stockholders.   (c) The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of the preceding subsection unless
the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends to take such action. In addition, the Company shall
notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by
the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering
making an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally
and in writing and shall provide Parent with copies of any written
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide to Parent any information
provided to such Third Party. The Company shall promptly inform Parent of any
material developments with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and the advisors, employees and other agents of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Company to return or destroy all such information.   "Superior Proposal"
means any bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal made in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, which is reasonably capable of being consummated on the
terms proposed, and which the Board of Directors determines in good faith by
a majority vote, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account
all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation and such other facts as the Board of Directors deems in good
faith are appropriate) is more favorable and provides greater value to all
the Company\'s stockholders than as provided hereunder and for which
financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed and subject to no
conditions other than those set forth in the Commitment Letter (whether by
including new     40   conditions or conditions similar to the
Commitment Letter in a manner that makes such commitment more
conditional).   Section 6.05. Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of:   (a) any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that  the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   (b) any
notice or other communication from any governmental or  regulatory agency or
authority in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement; and   (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings  commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to
or  involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to 
have been disclosed pursuant to Sections 4.13, 4.15, 4.24 or 4.25, as the 
case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 6.06. Financing Cooperation. The
Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
officers, directors, employees, accountants, auditors, consultants, legal
counsel, financing sources, agents and other representatives to provide, all
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement by Parent of the

Company\'s indebtedness, including (a) participation in meetings, drafting
sessions, due diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, road
shows and sessions with rating agencies; (b) preparation of business
projections, financial statements, offering and/or information memoranda,
private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents and (c)

release, notices, or other requested certificates or documents, including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters, comfort letters of accountants and consents of accountants
for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Financing; provided
that the Financing may not require the payment of any commitment or other
similar fee or impose any other liability on the Company prior to the
Effective Time.   ARTICLE 7  COVENANTS OF PARENT   Parent agrees
that:     41    Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent
shall, and shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, take all action necessary to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   Section 7.02.
Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation,
and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:   (a) For
six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former officers and directors of the Company (each an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions,
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or provided under the Company\'s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof;
provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under applicable law.   (b) For six years after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person currently
covered by the Company\'s officers\' and directors\' liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided that,
in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.02, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay premiums in excess of 250% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount
the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof (such 250%
amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"); provided further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for the cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In lieu of
the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six
year "tail" prepaid officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Indemnified Person currently covered by the Company\'s officers\'
and directors\' liability insurance policy; provided that the premium and
terms of such insurance are reasonably acceptable to Parent (it being
understood that a policy with a premium not in excess of the Maximum Annual
Premium shall be deemed to be reasonably acceptable to Parent).   (c) If
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall     42   be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.   (d)
The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
under Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of
any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.   Section 7.03.
Financing. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
effectuate the Financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
(a) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions contained therein and (b) to satisfy all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary in such definitive agreements that are within
its control. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (including any
"flex" provisions in any fee letter or otherwise), Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from
alternative sources at rates and on terms and conditions to Parent that
are not, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, materially less favorable,
when taken as a whole, to Parent than set forth in the Commitment Letter
(including any "flex" provisions in any fee letter or otherwise) and related
documentation. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach by any party of the Commitment Letter or any termination of the
Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to
be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letter without first consulting the Company.   Section 7.04.
Access To Employees. Parent agrees that it and its Affiliates shall not
contact any employee of the Company regarding his or her employment with the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time without the prior approval of
the Company\'s chief executive officer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that it will
cooperate with the Parent with respect to planning for
Surviving Corporation\'s business after the Effective Time, including
cooperating with a post-transition integration committee; provided that such
planning does not interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.   ARTICLE 8  COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the

(ii) following any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b)

months of any such termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b) of this
Agreement, stockholders of the Company receive, or the Company enters into

out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
their counsel) actually incurred by any of them in connection with this
Agreement and the Master Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby (including the arrangement of, obtaining the commitment to
provide or obtaining any financing for such transactions and currency and
interest rate swaps or other hedging arrangements) up to $10,000,000 for
Parent, EQT and Zeiss in the aggregate upon any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to (i) Section 10.01(b)(i) in connection with a failure to satisfy

10.01(d) or (iii) (in addition to the circumstances described in clause (i)
of this sentence but without duplication) Section 10.01(b), if a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made prior to, and not withdrawn by,
such termination pursuant to Section 10.01(b).   (d) Upon termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i), if, at the time of such
termination, all other conditions set forth in Article 9 have been satisfied

transfer of immediately available funds), no later than 5 Business Days after
submission of reasonable documentation thereof, for 100% of its reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
their counsel) actually incurred by it in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby up to $1,750,000 in the aggregate.  
(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails

judgment against the Company for such amount.     53    (f) If amounts
required to be paid to Parent, Zeiss, EQT or the Company, as applicable,

exclusive remedy of the receiving party for any claims arising out of this

may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except
that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign, in whole or from

into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but no such transfer or
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its
obligations hereunder.   Section 11.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.   Section

each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become

signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right
or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).   Section 11.10. Entire Agreement. Other
than the Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits) constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.  
Section 11.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.   Section 11.12. Specific Performance. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement

provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or
