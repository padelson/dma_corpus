ARTICLE II 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 2.1 Conversion of Shares.

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Holdco, Sub, the Company or any
holders of shares of capital stock of the Company:

(i) Each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ") that is held in the treasury of the
Company and any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Holdco, Sub or any
other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such shares, the "
_Excluded Company Shares_ ").

(ii) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Company
Shares (as defined in Section 2.3)) shall be converted into the right to
receive (1) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $23.00 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ "), plus (2) a contingent value right (a " _CVR_ ") issued by
Holdco pursuant to the CVR Indenture ((1) and (2) together, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). Each CVR issued pursuant to the CVR Indenture will be
substantially in the form attached as Annex A to the CVR Indenture (the " _CVR
Certificate_ "). The CVR Certificates will be issued by Holdco pursuant to
the CVR Indenture.



 

2 All such shares of Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder
of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing any
such shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest.

(b) All of the membership interests of Sub, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any

of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 Payment and Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Prior to the mailing of the information statement/prospectus to be
included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Holdco with
the SEC (as defined in Section 3.4(a)) in connection with the Merger (such
information statement/prospectus, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Information Statement/Prospectus_ ", and such
registration statement, together with any amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Registration Statement_ "), Parent shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to Securityholders (as
defined in Section 2.2(b)) under this ARTICLE II. Parent and Holdco will enter
into a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company at least two Business Days prior to the mailing to the
stockholders of the Company the Information Statement/Prospectus. As used
herein, " _Business Day_ " means any day of the year on which national
banking institutions in New York are open to the public for conducting
business and are not required or authorized to close.

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent (A) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration and (B) the CVR Certificates representing the CVRs issuable
pursuant to the CVR Indenture pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) (such aggregate
amount of Cash Consideration and the CVRs, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") to which
the holders (collectively, the " _Securityholders_ ") of all shares of Common
Stock (other than Excluded Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares),
Options and RSUs (each of Options and RSUs as defined in Section 2.7) become
entitled under this ARTICLE II. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange
Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the Securityholders and (ii) promptly
applied to making the payments provided for in this ARTICLE II. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The
Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed
by Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is
pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest, commercial
paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination thereof.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be kept
in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the aggregate Cash Consideration to be
paid to Securityholders as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace
or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at
a level sufficient to make such payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of such funds) that remains undistributed to the
Securityholders one year after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be
delivered to Parent at such time. Thereafter, Securityholders shall look only
to Parent (subject to  



 

3  the terms of this Agreement) as a general creditor for payment of the
consideration payable to them under this ARTICLE II, without interest, upon
the surrender of any Certificates held by them.

(c) As soon as practicable (but in any event within 2 Business Days) after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
stockholder of record of shares of Common Stock represented by Certificates,
other than Excluded Company Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in a form reasonably agreed upon by Parent, Holdco
and the Company prior to the Closing); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or delivery of such customary
affidavits and indemnities with respect to a lost Certificate which the
Paying Agent and/or the Companys transfer agent may reasonably require) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent after the Effective Time, together with such
letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1, and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 3.9(e)) required by reason of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing any
Dissenting Company Shares or Excluded Company Shares) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, and the number of CVRs
into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to each
holder of shares of Common Stock represented by book-entry on the records of
the Company or the Companys transfer agent (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), on
behalf of the Company, other than Excluded Company Shares, a check in the
amount of cash and CVR Certificates representing the number of CVRs into which
such Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1.

Section 2.3 Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ")
will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
holders of such shares will be entitled to receive payment of the value of
such shares determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL, the shares of Common Stock held by such
holder will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Upon the Companys receipt of any notice of intent to demand
payment in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, or any withdrawal of
such notice, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable provide
Parent with a copy of such notice. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent or pursuant to a valid court order, make any
payment with respect to any such election to dissent or offer to settle or
settle any such election to dissent.

Section 2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  



 

4  Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law. All cash paid and
all CVR Certificates issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock.

Section 2.5 Closing of Company Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

Section 2.6 Adjustments. If prior to the Effective Time there is a change in
the number of shares of Common Stock as a result of a distribution,
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, subdivision, spin-
off, issue tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and any other payments to Securityholders based upon the Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of this
event on the Merger Consideration and such other payments.

Section 2.7 Stock Options and RSUs.

(a) All options (individually, an " _Option_ " and collectively, the "
_Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under any
Company stock option or equity incentive plan (" _Company Stock Plan_ "),
whether or not then vested and exercisable, shall be canceled at the Effective
Time and:

(i) each holder of an Option with a per share exercise price that is less than
the Cash Consideration will be immediately entitled to receive, for
each share of Common Stock subject to such Option, (A) an amount in cash
equal to the excess of the Cash Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Option, without interest, and (B) one CVR; and

(ii) each holder of an Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to
or greater than the Cash Consideration will be entitled, upon payout of the
CVRs in accordance with their terms, to receive, for each share of Common
Stock subject to such Option, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the excess, if any, of (x) the Cash Consideration plus the amount of cash per
CVR paid to the CVR holders in accordance with the terms of the CVR over (y)
the per share exercise price of such Option.

For the avoidance of doubt, each holder of an Option with a per share
exercise price that is greater than $29.00 shall not be entitled to receive
any portion of the Merger Consideration.

(b) Each restricted stock unit (" _RSU_ ") granted by the Company under any
Company Stock Plan, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective
Time, and the holders of RSUs will be entitled to receive, for each RSU, (i)
cash, without interest, equal to the Cash Consideration and (ii) one CVR.

(c) Any such amounts representing Cash Consideration shall be paid by the
Paying Agent promptly following the Effective Time from the Exchange Fund,
and any CVR Certificates required to be distributed pursuant to this Section
2.7 shall be distributed by the Paying Agent, in each case in accordance with
Section 2.2.



 

5 (d) Each Company Stock Plan and each Option and each RSU shall terminate as of
the Effective Time, and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital stock (or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock) of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time,
subject to the right of the holders of outstanding Options and RSUs to receive
the consideration provided for in this Section 2.7. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Companys board of directors (the " _Board of Directors_
") (or a committee thereof) will (a) adopt amendments to, or make
determinations with respect to, the Company Stock Plans, individual agreements
evidencing the grant of Options or any shares of restricted stock of the
Company (" _Restricted Stock_ "), RSUs and Employee Benefit Plans (as defined
in 0(a)), if necessary, to implement the provisions of this Section 2.7 and
(b) take all necessary action to terminate the Company Stock Plans and all
grants of Options, Restricted Stock and RSUs.

Section 2.8 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One New York Plaza, New York, New York 10004,
at 9:00 A.M. local time on the day which is no later than four Business Days
after the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII
(other than those that can only be fulfilled at the Closing) is fulfilled or
waived, or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree
in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the
" _Closing Date_."

Section 2.9 Withholding of Tax. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Parent, the Company, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock, RSUs or
Options, such amounts as Parent, the Company, any Affiliate thereof or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Company, any Affiliate thereof, Parent or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.3(c)) in accordance
with applicable law and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder or participant, as the case may be, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, any
Affiliate thereof, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the  



 

6  Company (as defined below). Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company

of developments or conditions in credit, financial, banking or securities
markets (including any disruption thereof), including without limitation,

any of the industries, geographic areas or business segments in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including without limitation, any

disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries as
compared to other companies in the U.S. generic pharmaceutical industry), (f)

or results of operations, or any published financial forecasts or analyst
estimates of the Companys revenue, earnings or other financial performance or
results of operations or any change in analyst recommendations, for any
period, or (h) any change or effect attributable to the
execution, performance or announcement of this Agreement (including the
impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,
suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors, partners or employees,
including without limitation, the loss or departure of officers or other
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries), or otherwise resulting from the
pursuit of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each of (d) and (g), nothing in
such clause shall prevent a determination that any underlying causes of such
changes results in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

securities of any Subsidiary of the Company, including any right of conversion
or exchange under any outstanding securities, instruments or agreements.

other contractual obligation (each a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or

assets are bound, except for any such violation, breach, default or right of

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(a) Since January 1, 2007, the Company has filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") all documents required to
be filed or furnished by the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the
Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and as of their respective dates and except as amended or supplemented prior
to the date hereof (or with respect to Company SEC Documents filed
or furnished after the date hereof, except as amended or supplemented prior
to the Closing Date), none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that no representation is made by the Company with respect to information
supplied by Parent, Holdco, Sub or their respective Subsidiaries for
inclusion in the Company SEC Documents. The audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, and the unaudited financial
statements of the Company included in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2008 (collectively, the "
_Company Financial Statements_ "), have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at  



 

9  the dates thereof and the results of their operations and changes in

with past practices, (iii) would not reasonably be expected to have a Material

Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ") with respect to the Company SEC Documents. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" have the meanings ascribed to those terms under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have designed internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company
has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports.

Section 3.5 Information Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement. None

incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the Information
Statement/Prospectus at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective
under the Securities Act and at the time the Information Statement/Prospectus
is mailed to stockholders of the Company, will contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by
Parent, Holdco or Sub for inclusion in any of such documents. The Information
Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement shall comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act.

respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) there has not occurred any event which has had a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any actions which, if taken after the date of this

(xviii), (xxi) or (xxii).



 

10 Section 3.7 Litigation. There is no material suit, action, arbitration,
proceeding, claim, charge, regulatory or accrediting agency investigation,
case or other proceeding (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company (as defined in Section 9.14), threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or asset of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any writ, judgment, injunction or decree that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Section 3.8 No Violation of Law. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has been given written notice of any
violation of, any law, statute, order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment
of any Governmental Entity, except for violations which would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To
the knowledge of the Company, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity is pending or threatened, other than those the outcome of which would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, franchises,
variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental authorizations, consents
and approvals necessary to conduct their businesses in all material respects
as presently conducted (collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "), except for
permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders, authorizations,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are not in violation of the terms of any Company Permit, except
for delays in filing reports or violations which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. This Section 3.8
does not relate to matters which are the subject of Section 3.9, Section 3.10
or Section 3.11.

Section 3.9 Taxes.

(a) Except as would not be material to the Company, (i) the Company and its

be filed by them, and such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate in all
material respects, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have paid (or have

21 Section 4.5 Information Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement. None
of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement or the Information Statement/Prospectus at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act and at the time the
Information Statement/Prospectus is mailed to stockholders of the Company will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent, Holdco or Sub
with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in any of such documents.

Section 4.6 Availability of Funds. Parent shall have available at the
Closing sufficient funds to pay the Cash Consideration in respect of all of
the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, pay all amounts payable at the
Closing in respect of then outstanding Options and RSUs, refinance the
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and pay all fees, expenses
and other amounts payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger. Parent expressly agrees and acknowledges that its obligations
hereunder, including its, Holdcos and Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger, are not subject to, or conditioned on, Parents, Holdcos or Subs
receipt of financing. True, correct and complete copies of the debt and equity
financing documents dated prior to or as of the date of this Agreement from
Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit Suisse (collectively,
the " _Banks_ ") (as such financing documents may be modified or replaced, the
" _Financing Documents_ ") pursuant to which the Banks have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide, either
directly or through their respective Affiliates, equity and debt financing
necessary to consummate the Merger, have been provided to the Company. The
Financing Documents have been fully executed and delivered by the Banks and,
when executed by Parent, which will occur immediately after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, will be valid and enforceable against the parties
thereto in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a preceding in equity or at law). As of the date of this Agreement, to the
knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse
of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Financing
Documents by Parent and the commitments contained in the Financing Documents
have not been withdrawn or rescinded. Parent has no knowledge of any facts or
circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in (i) any of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Documents not being satisfied or (ii)
the funding contemplated in the Financing Documents not being made available
to Parent on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any refinancing of the indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries necessary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Financing Documents have been
amended or modified and no such amendment or modification is contemplated
except to the extent required to reflect the appointment of Appointees (as
defined in the Financing Documents) on the terms thereof, or to allow for the
accession of other reputable banks as co-lead underwriters, co-mandated lead
arrangers and co-bookrunners to the Financing Documents on the same terms and
conditions as the Banks. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Documents that are payable on or
prior to the execution thereof. There are no conditions or other contingencies
related to the funding in full of the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Documents other than as set forth therein.

Section 4.7 Litigation. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent (as defined in Section 9.14), threatened against Parent, Holdco or Sub
or any of their Subsidiaries or any property or asset of Parent, Holdco or Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries which, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of
Parent, Holdco or Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or under the
Related Agreements or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related
Agreements. Neither Parent, Holdco nor Sub is subject to any writ, judgment,
injunction or decree which,  



 

22  individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of Parent, Holdco or Sub to perform their
obligations hereunder or under the Related Agreements or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related Agreements.

Section 4.8 Brokers and Finders. No broker, investment banker or other Person,
other than Deutsche Bank AG, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent, Holdco or Sub.

Section 4.9 Access to Information; Disclaimer. In connection with the
investigation by Parent, Holdco and Sub of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Parent, Holdco and Sub have received or may receive from the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking statements and other
forecasts and certain business plan information. Each of Parent, Holdco
and Sub acknowledges that the Company makes no representation or warranty
(express or implied) with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans). Parent, Holdco and Sub
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that each of Parent,
Holdco and Sub is familiar with such uncertainties, that each of Parent,
Holdco and Sub is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that Parent,
Holdco and Sub shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto.

Section 4.10 Solvency. As of the Effective Time, assuming satisfaction of the
conditions to Parents, Holdcos and Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation the
Financing (as defined in Section 6.6(c)) or any Alternative Financing (as
defined in Section 6.7(c)), any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
by the Financing Documents, the funding of any obligations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries which become due or payable at the Closing by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result of, the Merger and
payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Holdco and the Surviving
Corporation and APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC will be Solvent. For the purposes of
this Section 4.10 the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent
and other liabilities" as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations
of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required
to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured,
(b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due.

Section 4.11 Ownership of Shares. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent, Holdco, Sub or their respective Affiliates owns (beneficially or of
record) any shares of Common Stock, and none of Parent, Holdco, Sub or their
respective Affiliates is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of
any shares of Common Stock. 



 

23 Section 4.12 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly contained in this ARTICLE IV, the
Company acknowledges that neither Parent, Holdco, Sub or any other Person on
behalf of Parent, Holdco or Sub makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses or any other matter or with respect to any other
information provided or made available to the Company, and that all such
representations and warranties, other than the representations and warranties
of Parent, Holdco and Sub expressly contained in this ARTICLE IV, are
expressly disclaimed. Neither Parent, Holdco, Sub nor any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the
Company or any other Person relating to or resulting from the distribution to
the Company, or use by the Company of, any such information, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts, confidential information
memoranda or management presentations in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that the foregoing limitations shall
not (a) apply to Parent, Holdco or Sub to the extent Parent, Holdco or Sub
makes the specific representations and warranties set forth in this ARTICLE
IV, but always subject to the limitations and restrictions contained herein,
or (b) preclude the Company from seeking any remedy for fraud.

written or oral comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement
or the Information Statement/Prospectus or for additional information and
shall supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence between such
party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Registration Statement or the
Information Statement/Prospectus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Registration Statement or Information Statement/Prospectus (or any
respective amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect thereto, each party (i) shall provide the other parties
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) shall reasonably consider all comments reasonably proposed
by the other party. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the
Information Statement /Prospectus has been cleared by the SEC and, if required
by law, the CVR Indenture has been qualified under the  



 

27  Trust Indenture Act, the Company shall mail the Information
Statement/Prospectus to the holders of shares of Common Stock.

(c) Each of the Company, Sub, Holdco and Parent shall advise the other party,
promptly after it receives notice, after the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of the CVRs issuable in connection with
the Merger. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Holdco or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates is
discovered by the Company, Holdco or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the
Information Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party discovering this information
shall promptly notify the other parties and, to the extent required by law,
the parties shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement describing this
information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
law, disseminated to the Securityholders of the Company.

Section 6.2 Listing. Parent shall cause Holdco to as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof prepare and submit to the NASDAQ Capital Market of the
Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (the " _NASDAQ_ ") (or such other exchange(s),
electronic trading networks or other suitable trading platforms as are
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) an application covering the CVRs
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the CVRs being issued in
the Merger to be approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) for
trading on the NASDAQ (or such other exchange(s), electronic trading networks
or other suitable trading platforms as are mutually agreed by Parent and the
Company) at or prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.3 Directors and Officers Indemnification.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (and
their successors) to establish and maintain for a period of not less than six
years from and after the Effective Time provisions in their certificates of
incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents concerning the
indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating to expense
advancement) of the Companys and its Subsidiaries former and current
officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to
those persons than the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-
Laws and other organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
in effect as of the date hereof. Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally
liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms each
of the covenants contained in this Section 6.3.

(b) In addition to and not in limitation of the terms of Section 6.3(a), from
and after the Effective Time, each of Parent, Holdco and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law and without limit as to time, each present and former director, officer
and employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such director,
officer or employee, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with (i) any acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to occur prior to, or as of, the Effective Time in their
capacities as officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or taken by them at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, acts or omissions in connection
with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any
entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company)
or (ii) the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger  



 

28  or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of
or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect, without any lapse in coverage, the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
directors and officers than the current policies) for a claims-reporting or
discovery period of at least such six year period with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that (i) in
lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent, the Company may purchase a
six-year extended reporting period endorsement under its existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage effective for claims asserted for
the full six year period referred to above, and (ii) during this period,
Parent shall not be required to procure any coverage in excess of the amount
that can be obtained for the remainder of the period for an annual premium of
250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing
coverage.

(d) The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
Section 6.3 as such fees are incurred upon the written request of any
Indemnified Party.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may
have under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or any other
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any other
indemnification arrangement in existence as of the date of this Agreement,
the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are expressly intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns.

(f) If Parent, Holdco or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
corporation or entity and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of the consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other
entity, then and in each case, proper provisions will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.3.

Section 6.4 No Solicitation. 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.4, after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys and
other advisors or representatives (" _Representatives_ ") of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, not to, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, or induce any
inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any
proposal or offer which would reasonably be expected to lead to a merger,
acquisition, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or similar
transaction involving, or any proposal or offer to purchase or acquire in any
manner (A) assets representing 15% or more of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) an equity interest in 15% or more
of the voting securities of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries if such
Subsidiaries own directly or indirectly 15% or more of the assets referred to
in clause (A) (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
" _Acquisition Proposal_ "), other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) enter into, participate, continue or otherwise engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public information to any
Person (other than Parent, Holdco, Sub and their representatives) with respect
to any inquiries  



 

29  regarding, or the making of, an Acquisition Proposal or that would otherwise
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) enter into or
approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
immediately terminate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to immediately terminate, all discussions or negotiations, if
any, that are ongoing as of the date hereof with any third party with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.4, the Company may (A) provide
information in response to a request by a Person who has made a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated or solicited in violation
of Section 6.4(a) if the Company receives from the Person so requesting the
information an executed confidentiality agreement no more favorable in
any material respect to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 6.5) is to Parents Affiliate; and/or (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated or solicited in violation of
Section 6.4(a), if, in each case, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith that failure to take this action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and in the case
referred to in clause (B) above, if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. As
used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal (for this purpose substituting "60%" for each reference to 15% in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal") that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and legal counsel) is reasonably expected to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal,
and if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more favorable to
the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into
account any revisions to the terms of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement agreed to by Parent pursuant to Section 6.4(c)
and Section 8.3), where the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded,
in good faith, that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to
identify such Acquisition Proposal as a Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly, and in any
event within three Business Days, after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal.
The written notice shall include the identity of the third party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal and
copies of any substantive written communications and documents setting
forth the terms of such Acquisition Proposal received by the Company from the
third party making such Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material changes with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly notify Parent orally and in
writing upon determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. The Company shall not exercise
its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) hereof until
after the fifth Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice (a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Board
of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d). The Company agrees that after notifying
Parent that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, including during
the five-Business Day period specified in the preceding sentence (such period,
the " _Parent Review Period_ "), Parent will be permitted to propose to the
Company revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company and its Representatives will, if requested by
Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.



 

30 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making such
disclosure to the Companys stockholders which, in the judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company after receiving advice of outside legal counsel,
is reasonably likely to be required under applicable law.

Section 6.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to Parents
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records; _provided,
however,_ that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the Companys
operations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5, the
Company shall not be required to provide any information which it reasonably
believes it may not provide Parent, Holdco or Sub by reason of applicable law
(including antitrust laws), rules or regulations, which constitutes
information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which the Company or
any Subsidiary is required to keep confidential by reason of Contract,
agreement or understanding with third parties. All information exchanged
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between the Company and
Parent, dated April 25, 2008.

Section 6.6 Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including
(i) the obtaining of all Consents and the making of all Registrations
specified in Section 3.3(c) and Section 4.4 and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain such Consents and to make such
Registrations, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger, including, seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the obligations set
forth in this sentence shall not be deemed to have been breached as a result
of actions by the Company expressly permitted under Section 6.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
obligated to prepay or redeem debt (or notes), amend or waive the provisions
of any Contract, or to pay any consent or similar fees or payments unless such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not take or agree to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent consummation
of the Merger.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company undertakes
and agrees to file as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to seven
days after the date hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "
_Antitrust Division_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto. Parent shall commit to take  



 

31  all steps which it is capable of taking to avoid or eliminate impediments
under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted
by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the
consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable and shall defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any
party, including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall
propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise commit to take any
action which it is capable of taking, take or commit to take such action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
any of the businesses, services or assets of Parent, Holdco, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order
or other order in any suit or Proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any such
action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nor
anything else contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to
sell, divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, enter into any license
or similar agreement with respect to, restrict the ownership or operation of,
or agree to sell, divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, enter into
any license or similar agreement with respect to, or restrict the ownership
or operation of (A) any assets or businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (B) any assets or businesses of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, in either case, to the extent that such sale,
divestiture, disposition, or agreement would have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
combined business of Fresenius Kabi AG and the Company after giving effect to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
party shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any material communication
to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General
or any other Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable law, discuss with
and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates and
their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity
or members of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts in
connection with the debt and equity financing necessary to consummate
the Merger (the " _Financing_ ") to (provided that (x) none of the following
shall unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Company and (y) all
non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.6(c) shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement):

(i) provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
reasonably necessary and customary;

(ii) assist Parent with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations necessary and customary in connection with the Financing and
participate in customary meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies;



 

32 (iii) assist Parent with the preparation of an offering memorandum, in
accordance with customary practices for an offering under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act; provided that any offering memoranda or prospectuses need not
be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

(iv) furnish Parent with financial and other pertinent information regarding
the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent to consummate
the Financing of the type and form customarily included in private placements
under Rule 144A under the Securities Act; and

(v) assist Parent in procuring accountants comfort letters and consents,
payoff letters, lien releases, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as
reasonably requested by Parent;

(vi) provide and execute customary officers certificates and other similar
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent so long as no
such document is effective until the occurrence of the Closing Date; and

(vii) take all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time, reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the consummation of
the Financing.

(d) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all out-of-pocket costs and third-party expenses incurred by the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives in connection with
the cooperation set forth in Section 6.6(c). Nothing contained in Section
6.6(c) shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing (including, without limitation, entering into a purchase
agreement with respect to the issuance of securities under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act) prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors and other representatives for and against any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith except with
respect to information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

(e) Subject to compliance with all applicable laws, the Company and Parent,
as the case may be, shall confer on a regular basis with each other, report on
operational matters and shall promptly advise each other orally and in writing
upon becoming aware of any change or event having, or which would
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Furthermore, the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent, Holdco or Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, upon becoming aware (i) that any representation or warranty made by
it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
(ii) of any condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the
conditions in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.3(a) not being met, or (iii) of the
failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of, or the conditions
to the obligations of, the parties hereto under this Agreement.

(f) The Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other (or their
respective counsel) copies of all filings made by such party or its
Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger.

Section 6.7 Financing.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the  



 

33  Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Documents,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis
all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Financing Documents;
(ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Financing Documents (except in connection with
the equity financing); (iii) enforce its rights under the Financing Documents
(including by taking enforcement action to cause the Banks and their
respective Affiliates party to the Financing Documents to fund the Financing);
and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to extend the term of the debt
portion of the Financing up to and including June 30, 2009. Parent will
furnish correct and complete copies of all such definitive agreements to the
Company promptly upon their execution, provided that these copies may be
redacted or blackened to the effect that the pricing and other confidential
information related to Parents business and the Banks are not disclosed, so
long as the redacted or blackened provisions are not necessary to understand
any conditions to the Financing. Prior to the expiration of the equity
commitment of Deutsche Bank AG contained in the Financing Documents (as such
commitment may be extended from time to time) but no later than the Closing,
Parent agrees to draw upon such equity commitment in full and hold separate
the proceeds of such equity issuance to fund the Cash Consideration.

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Documents and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two
Business Days, if at any time (i) any Financing Document shall expire or be
terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to any
Financing Document notifies Parent that such source no longer intends to
provide financing to Parent on the terms set forth therein, or (iii) for any
reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents on
the terms described therein. Parent shall not amend or alter, or agree to
amend or alter, any Financing Document in any manner that would prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger without the prior
written consent of the Company.

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Documents or any Financing
Document shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to
Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger (" _Alternate Financing_ "). To the
extent applicable, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in the Alternate Financing; (ii) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Alternate Financing (except in connection with the equity financing, as
applicable); (iii) enforce its rights under the Alternate Financing; and (iv)
consummate the Alternate Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent shall
keep Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Alternate Financing and shall, upon
request, provide copies of all documents related to the Alternate Financing
to the Company, provided that these copies may be redacted or blackened to the
effect that the pricing and other confidential information related to Parents
business are not disclosed. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (a)
all or any portion of the Financing structured as a high-yield financing has
not been consummated, and (b) all closing conditions contained in Article VII
(other than the delivery of the officers certificates contemplated
in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3) shall have been satisfied or waived, then
Parent shall cause the proceeds of the bridge financing contemplated by the
Financing Documents to be used to replace such high-yield financing no later
than the date specified for Closing in Section 2.8.



 

34 (d) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to execute definitive
agreements consistent with the Financing Documents (except in connection with
the equity financing) as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
but in any event within 45 days after the date hereof.

Section 6.8 Completion of the Spin-Off. The Company shall, and shall cause the
relevant Company Subsidiary to, at the cost and expense of the Company or
Abraxis BioScience, Inc., as applicable, use reasonable best efforts to
effect, as promptly as practicable, the transfers of any assets (including
Intellectual Property), liabilities, businesses and employees and the
distributions, dissolutions and divestitures substantially as described in
Section 3.19 of the Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the provisions of
the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Section 6.9 Benefit Plans.

(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending not less than
two years following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation (i) to at least maintain the base salary or base wages of the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) to either (x) at
least maintain the Employee Benefit Plans (other than equity-based benefits)
in effect on the date of this Agreement or (y) provide employee benefits
(other than equity-based benefits) to each current employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are substantially similar in the aggregate to such
employees than those benefits in effect for such employees on the date of this
Agreement. For a period of two years from the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide to the employees of the Surviving Corporation equity-based awards
substantially similar to those which are provided by Parent to its similarly
situated employees.

(b) In addition to the agreement set forth in Section 6.9(a), from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to honor the obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries under the Employee Benefit Plans and the Material
Employment Agreements in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect
on the date of this Agreement), and the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, shall perform the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under such Employee Benefit Plans and Material Employment
Agreements, including, without limitation, the Companys severance,
retention, change in control and bonus plans and policies, provided that for
purposes of this provision, the words "in an amount or having a value in
excess of $125,000 per year or $500,000 in the aggregate" in the definition
of Material Employment Agreement will not be given effect. In addition, each
of Parent, Holdco and the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations
of the Company under all existing indemnification agreements between the
Company and its directors, officers and employees. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall limit the ability of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan,
Material Employment Agreement or indemnity agreement following the Effective
Time, to the extent permitted by any such agreement.

(c) To the extent that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any severance
plan), then for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, early retirement and benefit accrual, service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however,_ that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent
shall take such action as may be necessary so that all such plans shall waive
any pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation by and coverage of such employees and shall
provide that any expenses, co-payments, and deductibles paid or incurred on or
before the Effective Time by or on behalf of any such employees shall be
taken into account under applicable Parent benefit plans for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions.



 

35 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the
provisions set forth on Section 6.9(d) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.9 are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including, without
limitation, any current or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or any beneficiary
thereof.

Section 6.10 Fees and Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) Subject to Section 6.10(d), the Company agrees to pay Parent a fee equal
to $140 million if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) (in which case, the fee shall be payable at the time of
termination).

(c) The fee payable pursuant to Section 6.10(b) shall be made by wire transfer
of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in
Section 6.10(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Holdco and Sub would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.10(b), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent, Holdco or Sub commences a suit which results in a
binding nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction
against the Company for the fee set forth in Section 6.10(b), the Company
shall pay to Parent, Holdco or Sub its reasonable documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

(d) Parent agrees that the payment provided for in Section 6.10(b) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent upon termination of this Agreement
under circumstances giving rise to an obligation (or potential obligation) of
the Company to pay the amounts set forth in Section 6.10(b) and such remedy
shall be limited to the aggregate of the sums stipulated in such Section
6.10(b). In no event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more than
one termination fee pursuant to Section 6.10(b).

Section 6.11 Related Agreements. At or prior to the Closing, each of Parent
and Holdco will duly adopt, execute and deliver, and shall ensure that a duly
qualified Trustee executes and delivers, the CVR Indenture, subject to
any reasonable revisions to the CVR Indenture that are requested by such
Trustee.

Section 6.12 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent.
Thereafter, Parent, Holdco and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless it has
made reasonable efforts to do the foregoing, shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

Section 6.13 Holdco. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause
Holdco to perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set  



 

36  forth in this Agreement and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time,
Holdco shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than
as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.14 Sub. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) to ensure that, prior
to the Effective Time, Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.15 Repayment of Credit Agreement. At the Closing, Parent shall cause
to be repaid all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Section 6.16 Tax Matters.

(a) Holdco shall assume liability for and pay all sales, use, transfer, real
property transfer, documentary, recording, gains, stock transfer and
similar Taxes and fees, and any deficiency, interest or penalty asserted with
respect thereto (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. The
Company shall cooperate with Holdco as to the filing of all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

(b) Each of: (i) the Company, (ii) the Stockholders (as defined in the
Written Consent and Voting Agreement) and any other PSS Entity (as defined in
the Written Consent and Voting Agreement) that is the beneficial owner of
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
Parent, Holdco, and Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to
Tax Counsel a letter (such letters, the " _Tax Opinion Representation Letters_
"), dated as of the Closing Date, containing representations as shall be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Tax Counsel to render the Tax
Opinion to the Company, and substantially in the form attached hereto as part
of Exhibit D. As used in this Agreement, " _Tax Opinion_ " means the opinion
described in clause (ii)(A) of Section 4.02(b) of the Tax Allocation
Agreement, such opinion to be addressed and delivered to the Company and in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Abraxis BioScience, Inc. and
substantially in the form attached hereto as part of Exhibit D, and " _Tax
Counsel_ " means Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_
") or, if Fried Frank is unable or unwilling to render the Tax Opinion,
another nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to the Company
and Parent. The Company will submit the form of Tax Opinion to Abraxis
BioScience, Inc. for consideration as promptly as possible. 

(c) From the Closing Date until November 13, 2009, neither Parent nor any
Affiliate of Parent shall cause the Company to fail to be engaged in the
conduct of the active trade or business relied upon for purposes of satisfying
the requirements of Section 355(b) of the Code for purposes of the Private
Letter Ruling (as that term is defined in the Separation and
Distribution Agreement.)

extent that such representation and warranty speaks as of a particular date,
in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of
that date), except where the failure of the representations and warranties to

Adverse Effect on the Company. Parent shall have received a certificate to
such effect signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the
Company.

(b) _Performance of Obligations_. The Company shall have performed or complied
with, in all material respects, all obligations and covenants required to be

of each of Parent, Holdco and Sub to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations_. Parent, Holdco and Sub shall have performed

delivered by Holdco and the Trustee and be in full force and effect; and the
Equity Letter shall be in full force and effect.

Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company,
Parent, Holdco or Sub may rely on the failure of any condition precedent set
forth in this ARTICLE VII to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such
partys failure to comply with its obligations set forth in this Agreement to
consummate and make effective the transactions provided for herein, as
required by and subject to Section 6.6.

Section 7.5 Invoking Certain Provisions. If Parent, Holdco or Sub wish to

burden of proof to establish that such condition has not been satisfied. If
the Company wishes to invoke any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3 as
a basis not to consummate the Merger, the Company will have the burden of
proof to establish that such condition has not been satisfied. 

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of Stockholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

(i) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2009 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section  



 

39  8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date; _provided
further_ , that if the only condition or conditions (other than delivery of
the officers certificates contemplated in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3) not
capable of being satisfied prior to the Termination Date is the condition or
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(d) and/or Section 7.1(e), Parent or the
Company may elect to extend the Termination Date until June 30, 2009, so long
as Parent is able to extend the applicable financing commitment for the debt
portion of the Financing set forth in the Financing Documents on commercially
reasonably terms to June 30, 2009; or

(ii) if any U.S. federal or state court shall have issued or entered a
permanent injunction or other order that is in effect preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such injunction or order shall
have become final and nonappealable; provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement (including
such partys obligations set forth in Section 6.6) has been the cause of, or
resulted in, such action;

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this
Agreement, in any case, as a result of which a condition set forth in Section
7.2 will not be able to be satisfied prior to or as of the Termination Date or
waived by Parent (provided that Parent, Holdco or Sub is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement);

(d) by the Company, prior to the date that is 25 Business Days after the date
of this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into a letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with
respect to any Superior Proposal, provided that the Company has complied with
the terms of Section 6.4; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company shall
have received an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, during such 25-Business Day period,
constitutes either a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal (such proposal, an " _Excluded Proposal_ "), the Company
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d) after such 25-Business Day period in order to enter into a letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement with respect to an Excluded Proposal with the third party that has
made the Excluded Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (d) shall in any event
terminate 40 Business Days following the date of this Agreement; or

(e) by the Company, if Parent, Holdco or Sub breaches or fails to perform any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained in this
Agreement, in any case, as a result of which a condition set forth in Section
7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) will not be able to be satisfied prior to or as of
the Termination Date (provided that the Company is not then in material breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).

For the avoidance of doubt, if an Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acquisition Proposal made by the same party who made an Excluded Proposal)
is received after the date that is 25 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (d)
of this Section 8.1 above with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Holdco, Sub or the Company,
other than the last sentence of Section 6.5, Section 6.10, this Section 8.2
and Section 9.6, which provisions shall survive such termination, and
provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
knowing and material breach hereof.



 

40 Section 8.3 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Section 8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to
the proviso of Section 8.3, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement (provided, that a waiver must be in
writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective).
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

Section 8.5 Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3 shall, in order to be effective, require in
the case of Parent, Holdco, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of
Directors or applicable governing body or the duly authorized designee
thereof.
