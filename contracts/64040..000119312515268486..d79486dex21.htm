the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that (i)&nbsp;the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in Section&nbsp;9.12 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;the right of
specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and without that right, neither Parent or Merger Sub nor the Company would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties
otherwise have an adequate remedy at Law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section&nbsp;9.17 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. If, on or prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings any Litigation, in each case in accordance
with Section&nbsp;9.12, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be extended (x)&nbsp;for the period during which such Litigation is pending, plus ten
(10)&nbsp;Business Days or (y)&nbsp;by such other time period established by the court presiding over such Litigation, as the case may be. </P>

NMP Group and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason, the NMP Group, Fried Frank or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries believes that Fried Frank can or should no longer represent both the NMP
Group and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The parties understand and specifically agree that Fried Frank may withdraw from representing the Company and its Subsidiaries and continue to represent the NMP Group (or any other Equityholder),
even if the interests of the NMP Group (or such other Equityholder), and the interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are or may be adverse, including in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Documents or the Contemplated Transactions, and even though Fried Frank may have represented the Company and its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company or any of
its Affiliates, and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby consent thereto and waive any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications among Fried Frank, the Company, any of its

records related to the Contemplated Transactions, which shall become the property of (and be controlled by) the NMP Group. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between the NMP Group and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of or
relating to any matter related to the Contemplated Transactions in which Fried Frank acted for them both, none of the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or any other rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from
disclosure to the NMP Group any information or documents related to the Contemplated Transactions developed or shared during the course of Fried Frank&#146;s joint representation of the NMP Group and the Company and its Subsidiaries. The parties
