the Company and the Subsidiaries, pay the Company Debt to the party or parties
entitled thereto pursuant to instructions delivered by the Company to Buyer

(c) _Payment to the Company_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited the Incentive Plan Bonus Amount with the Company, for the benefit
of the participants in the MIP. As soon as practicable after the Effective

 **2.3** **_Merger Consideration Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) _Closing Estimates_. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer (i) the
Company Debt Instructions, (ii) the Selling Expenses Instructions, (iii) a
good faith estimate of (A) the Net Working Capital as of the close of business
on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date prepared in accordance with
the principles set forth on _Schedule 2.3_ and using the same methodology
used to calculate the items set forth on _Schedule 2.3_ (such estimate, the "
** _Estimated Working Capital_** "); and (B) the Cash and Cash Equivalents as
of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date
(such estimate, the " ** _Estimated Cash_** ") and (iv) an estimated
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP.
As contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)_, if the Estimated Working Capital is less
than the Target Working Capital, the Initial Merger Consideration will be
reduced by the amount of such shortfall (the " ** _Estimated Working Capital
Underage_** "). As contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)_, if the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Initial Merger
Consideration will be increased by the amount of such excess (the " **
_Estimated Working Capital Overage_** "). If the Estimated Working Capital is
equal to the Target Working Capital, the Initial Merger Consideration will not
be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Working Capital/Cash Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) __Closing Statement__. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Lenders Representative
a statement (the " ** _Closing Statement_** ") setting forth (i) the Net
Working Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the " ** _Final Working Capital_** "), prepared in
accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule 2.3_ and using the same
methodology used to calculate the items set forth on _Schedule 2.3_ , (ii) a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP
and (iii) a statement (the " ** _Cash Statement_** ") setting forth

 



       
 

 



 

the actual Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " ** _Final Cash_** ").

 



 

(ii) __Closing Statement Notice__. Within forty-five (45) days following
receipt by the Lenders Representative of the Closing Statement, the Lenders
Representative shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any dispute it has
with respect to the preparation or content of the Closing Statement (" **
_Closing Statement Dispute Notice_** "). If the Lenders Representative does
not deliver a Closing Statement Dispute Notice to Buyer within such forty-five
(45)-day period, the Final Working Capital and the Final Cash set forth in the
Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

 



 

(iii) __Closing Statement Dispute__. If Lenders Representative timely
delivers a Closing Statement Dispute Notice to Buyer, Buyer and the Lenders
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer
and the Lenders Representative, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail
to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days of Buyers receipt of the
Closing Statement Dispute Notice, then Buyer and the Lenders Representative
jointly shall engage the Arbitration Firm to arbitrate such dispute. As
promptly as practicable thereafter, Buyer and the Lenders Representative
shall each prepare and submit a presentation to the Arbitration Firm. As soon
as practicable thereafter, Buyer and the Lenders Representative will cause
the Arbitration Firm to choose one of the Parties position on Final Working
Capital and Final Cash based solely upon the presentations by Buyer and the
Lenders Representative. The Party whose position is not accepted by the
Arbitration Firm shall be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the
Arbitration Firm. The selection made by the Arbitration Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) __Working Capital Adjustment Payment__.

 



 

(A) In the event the sum of Final Working Capital and Final Cash (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ ) is less than the sum
of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Cash, then the Initial Merger
Consideration will be adjusted downward by an amount equal to such shortfall
(" ** _Final Working Capital/Cash Shortfall_** "), and the Lenders
Representative, within five (5) Business Days from the date on which Final
Working Capital and Final Cash is finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ ) (" ** _Final Determination Date_** "), shall cause
the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Funds, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Buyer to the Lenders Representative and the Escrow Agent, an amount equal to
such shortfall. In the event that the Final Working Capital/Cash Shortfall
exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Funds, then the Lenders Representative shall
promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds an amount equal to such excess, to the extent such amount is then
available.

 



      
 

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers sole recourse for payment of any Final
Working Capital/Cash Shortfall shall be the Escrow Funds.

 



 

(B) In the event the sum of the Final Working Capital and Final Cash (as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ ) is greater
than the sum of the Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Cash, then, the
Initial Merger Consideration will be adjusted upward by an amount equal to
such excess (" ** _Final Working Capital/Cash Excess_** "), and within five
(5) Business Days from the Final Determination Date, Buyer shall pay, or cause
to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Lenders
Representative an amount equal to the Final Working Capital/Cash Excess.

 



 

(C) In the event the sum of Final Working Capital and Final Cash (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ ) is equal to the sum
of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Cash, there will be no adjustment
to Initial Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)(iv)_.

 



 

(v) _Adjustment Escrow Fund Release_. All then-remaining Adjustment Escrow
Funds held under the Escrow Agreement shall be released to the Lenders
Representative within five (5) Business Days of the Final Determination Date,
provided that any payment from the Adjustment Escrow Amount to Buyer required
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(iv)(A)_, if any, shall have been made prior to
such release.

 



 

(c) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section 2.3_, Buyer and the Surviving Company, on the one hand, and the
Lenders Representative, on the other hand, shall, and the Surviving Company
shall cause the Subsidiaries to, cooperate with and make available to each
other and their respective representatives all information and records, and
shall permit access to its financial personnel, as may be reasonably required
in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Cash Statement and the
Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder. If the Buyer
and the Surviving Company, on the one hand, or the Lenders Representative, on
the other hand, breach their respective obligations under this _Section
2.3(c)_, the dispute period set forth in _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ shall
automatically be extended until such breach is cured by the breaching Party.

 



 

 **2.4** **_Dissenting Shares_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by Stockholders who shall have not voted in
favor of the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal
for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or still have the
right to demand (collectively, the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock held by them in accordance with the

 



      
 

 



 

provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by the
holders of Common Stock or Preferred Stock who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Buyer shall and shall cause Surviving
Company to comply with all aspects of Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Buyer prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company. Following
the Closing, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall not, except
without the prior written consent of Lenders Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

Intellectual Property used and held for use in the business of the Company and
the Subsidiaries as currently conducted (" ** _Requisite Rights_** "). Such
Requisite Rights are sufficient for the conduct of such business as currently
conducted. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries have transferred

that is or was material Company Intellectual Property to any Person.

(iii) registered Copyrights and applications therefor, and (iv) Domain Names.
Any and all filing, examination, registration, renewal and maintenance fees,

entity amounts and all documents, recordations and certificates in connection
with such Company Intellectual Property currently required to be filed have

maintain all material Company Intellectual Property. All of the foregoing
registered Company Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and enforceable
in accordance with applicable Law and all pending applications for
registration that have not issued or resulted in registration are subsisting
and in good standing. There are no facts, information, or circumstances that
would render any of the registered Company

 



      
 

 



 

Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable, or would preclude the issuance
of or otherwise affect any pending application for any Company Intellectual
Property, other than prior art references submitted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in the normal course of prosecuting applications
therefor. The Company, the Subsidiaries and their respective agents have not
misrepresented, or failed to disclose, any facts or information in any
application for any Company Intellectual Property that would constitute fraud
or a misrepresentation with respect to such application or that would
otherwise affect the enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property.
There have been no interferences, reissue, re-examination, invalidity,
revocation, opposition or similar proceedings brought or threatened involving
any of the registered or applied for Company Intellectual Property and, to the
Companys Knowledge, no third party has a reason to object to or oppose any
such application or registration.

Agreement, will cause: (i) the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to grant to

Property, (ii) Buyer or any of its Affiliates to grant to any third party any
right to or with respect to any Intellectual Property of Buyer or any of its

to lose any rights in or to any Requisite Rights, or (vi) the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries to be in violation of any Contract provision (including
restriction on assignment) or to be obligated to pay any royalties or other
fees or consideration with respect to any Intellectual Property of any Person
in excess of those payable by the Company or the Subsidiaries in the absence
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The representations
set forth in subclauses (ii) and (iv) above shall apply only to Contracts to
which the Company is a party.

 



 

(d) The Company or a Subsidiary solely and exclusively owns, and has good and
valid title to, the Company Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens. The Company has the sole and exclusive right to
bring a claim or suit against a third party for past, present or future
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the Company Intellectual
Property and to retain for itself any damages recovered in any such action.
All Company Intellectual Property is fully transferable, alienable, and

or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by the Company and the Subsidiaries pursuant to the Companys and the
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence

Beneficiary in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.
For six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any
Person to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Companys or any
Subsidiarys articles of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalents) relating to
the exculpation or indemnification of any officers or directors, it being the

acceptable to Buyer and the Lenders Representative (the " ** _D andO Tail_**").
Recourse of the DandO Beneficiaries shall first be against the DandO Tail until it
is exhausted or otherwise determined to be unavailable before recovery against
the Surviving Company shall take place.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each DandO Beneficiary, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other right to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

 **6.6** **_Financing_**. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, as reasonably
promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
and using reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as possible, (i) satisfy, or
cause to be satisfied, on a timely basis all conditions to Buyer obtaining the
Debt Financing set forth therein, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related flex provisions) or on other
terms that are in the aggregate not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Buyer (such definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing,
collectively, with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " ** _Debt Documents_** "),
and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing at

 



      
 

 



 

or prior to Closing. Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice (A) of
any breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt
Document of which Buyer becomes aware, (B) if and when Buyer becomes aware
that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter will not be available for the Financing Purposes, (C) of the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect
to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document, (D) if for any
reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain any
portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner and from the sources
contemplated by any Debt Commitment Letter (including any related flex terms)
or other Debt Document and (E) of any expiration or termination of the Debt
Commitment Letter or other Debt Document. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes, or would reasonably be expected to become, unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (after taking into
account flex terms), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on terms in
the aggregate not materially less favorable to Buyer than the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in an amount sufficient to replace
any unavailable portion of the Debt Financing (" ** _Alternative Financing_**
") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and the
provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall be applicable to the Alternative
Financing, and, for the purposes of this _Section 6.6_ and _Section 6.7_,
all references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such
Alternative Financing, all references to the Debt Commitment Letter or other
Debt Documents shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing and all references to the Financing Sources shall include the
Persons providing or arranging the Alternative Financing. Buyer shall (1) if
available sources of cash are not otherwise available to complete the
transactions contemplated herein, enforce in all material respects its rights
under each Debt Document in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources
that impedes or delays the Closing, and (2) not permit, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any material amendment or modification to be
made to, or any termination, rescission or withdrawal of, or any material
waiver of any provision or remedy under, any Debt Document or the fee letter
referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter, if any such amendment, modification
or waiver that (individually or in the aggregate with any other amendments,
modifications or waivers) would reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing under any Debt Document (including by
changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof), or
(y) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or
expand any condition, to the receipt of any portion of the Debt Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing,
(II) make the funding of any portion of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of
any condition to obtaining any portion of the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against any other party to any Debt Document, the ability of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the obtaining of the Debt Financing, or any Alternative Financing,
is not a condition to Closing and acknowledges its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement subject only to fulfillment or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_.

 



 

 **6.7** **_Cooperation with Financing_**. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall and shall use reasonable best efforts (at Buyers sole expense for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this _Section 6.7_) to cause its officers,

 



      
 

 



 

employees, consultants, legal representatives, agents, advisors, auditors,
investment bankers, lenders, Affiliates and other representatives (" **
_Representatives_** ") to cooperate with Buyer, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, as necessary in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing as may be customary and reasonably requested by Buyer
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries), including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) participate at reasonable times in meetings,
drafting sessions, presentations, road shows, and rating agency and due
diligence sessions, (ii) assist Buyer and its debt Financing Sources in the
preparation of (A) offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents for any portion of
the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iii)
cooperate with the marketing efforts of Buyer and its debt Financing Sources
for any portion of the Debt Financing, (iv) cooperate with Buyers legal
counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such legal counsel may be
required to deliver in connection with the Debt Financing, (v) assist Buyer in
obtaining landlord waivers and estoppels, access agreements, non-disturbance
agreements, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer or
the Financing Sources, (vi) furnish Buyer with customary financial and other
information regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries as may be customary for
a financing of the type set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, including, but not limited to, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income, changes in
equity and cash flows of the Company for the later of (A) June 30, 2015 and

Company will be deemed automatically modified to reflect such Post-Signing
Event. The delivery of any such supplemented or updated Schedules pursuant to
this _Section 6.8_ will be deemed to have cured any breach that otherwise
might exist or come to exist hereunder by reason of such Post-Signing Events
that do not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and Buyer will not
be entitled to terminate this Agreement nor will any Buyer Indemnitee have any
claim to indemnification or reimbursement in respect of or relating to any
such Post-Signing Event. In the event that such supplemented or updated
Schedules reflect any Post-Signing Events that do have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company (each, a " ** _Material Post-Signing Event_** "), Buyer
will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ by

_Section 6.10_ shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 6.10_ by the
Company. An " ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " shall mean any offer, proposal, or

Surviving Corporation and their respective subsidiaries to recognize, all
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any Subsidiary) for vesting and

vacation and severance). In no event shall anything contained in this _Section

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.13_ shall be construed to limit the right of
Buyer or any Subsidiary (including, following the Effective Time, the Company)
to amend or terminate any Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the
extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the
applicable plan, nor shall anything in this _Section 6.13_ be construed to
require Buyer or any Subsidiary (including, following the Effective Time, the
Company) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any
fixed period of time following the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _Copayments and Deductibles_. From and after the Effective Time, Buyer
will, or will cause the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries to, waive any
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements under any
employee benefit plan or program in which a Covered Employee becomes eligible
to participate following the Closing (the " ** _Surviving Company Benefit

thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the initiation of the 280G
Approval, who elects to execute such a Parachute Payment Waiver and who might
otherwise receive, have received, or have the right or entitlement to receive
any parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) under Section
280G of the Code, pursuant to which each such person who has executed such a
Parachute Payment Waiver shall agree, unless the 280G Approval has been
obtained in a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the

 



      
 

 



 

regulations promulgated thereunder, to waive any and all right or entitlement
to the payments, acceleration of vesting and/or other benefits referred to in
this _Section 6.13(f)_ to the extent the value thereof exceeds 2.99 times
such persons base amount determined in accordance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall deliver to Buyer on
or before the Closing Date any such Parachute Payment Waivers that have been
obtained. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
stockholder approval, in a manner which satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including Q-7 of Section
1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations, of any payments or benefits that could
be considered parachute payments for purposes of Section 280G of the Code such
that, if such approval is obtained, such payments and benefits shall not be
subject to Section 280G of the Code (the " ** _280G Approval_** "), and if
such approval is not obtained, such payments and benefits shall not be made
(or retained if applicable). As of the Closing Date, any "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) who would otherwise receive a "parachute
payment," as defined in Section 280G of the Code, who has not waived the right
to receive such payment shall have had his/her payment(s) reduced below the
applicable 280G threshold such that the person will no longer be treated as
receiving a parachute payment thereunder.

Reverse Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances in which such fee is due and payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, the Companys receipt of the Reverse Termination
Fee from Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ (and the payment of any amounts
pursuant to _Section 6.7_ and _Section 8.2(d)_, if applicable) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against Buyer or Merger Sub for any
loss or other liability of any kind suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer or Merger Sub hereunder or the failure of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated; _provided_ , _however_
that nothing herein shall limit the rights and remedies of the Company and its
Affiliates under the Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
while the Company may each pursue both a grant of specific performance to the
extent permitted by _Section 9.8_ and the payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee (and the payment of any amounts pursuant to _Section 6.7_ and _Section
8.2(d)_, if applicable), under no circumstances shall the Company or the
Lenders Representative be permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a full
and actually realized grant of specific performance to require Buyer to
consummate the Closing and (ii) payment of the Reverse Termination Fee. The
parties to this Agreement and the Lenders Representative acknowledge and
hereby agree that in no event shall Buyer or Merger Sub be required to pay the
Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and, in the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, in
no circumstances shall Buyer or Merger Sub be required to (i) pay an aggregate
amount in excess of the Reverse Termination Fee or (ii) pay any amount of
monetary damages (other than amounts pursuant to _Section 6.7_ and _Section
8.2(d)_, if applicable) if the Company has received the Reverse Termination
Fee.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If either the Company is awarded a grant of specific performance or
an injunction in accordance with _Section 9.8_ and the Closing occurs
thereafter or as a result thereof then Buyer shall pay to the Company any
fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Company in
connection with any such action, suit or proceeding. If Buyer fails promptly
to pay the Reverse Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company commences an action, suit or proceeding that results in a judgment
against Buyer for the Reverse Termination Fee, then Buyer shall pay to the
Company, together with the Reverse Termination Fee, (i) interest on the
Reverse Termination Fee from the date of termination of this Agreement at a
rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in

 



      
 

 



 

the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the Closing Date and
(ii) any fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) actually incurred by
the Company in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding.

 



 

(e) Without limiting in any way the Companys right to specific performance
solely to the extent provided in, and subject to the terms and conditions of
_Section 9.8_, the Companys right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee
(and the payment of any amounts pursuant to _Section 6.7_ and _Section
8.2(d)_, if applicable) from Buyer pursuant to, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, _Section 8.2(b)_, shall, unless the Closing occurs (in which
case this paragraph shall not apply), be the sole and exclusive remedy of any
Company Group Member against any Buyer Group Member for any monetary damages
suffered by any Company Group Member, or any liability or obligation of any
kind of any Buyer Group Member, in each case, caused by, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with (i) any breach or threatened or attempted
breach (whether willful or otherwise) of this Agreement or any other
agreement, certificate or other document entered into pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, (ii) any failure or threatened or attempted failure of Buyer
or Merger Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any other
agreement, certificate or other document entered into pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, (iii) any failure to consummate any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Closing, the funding of the Debt
Financing or Alternative Financing), or (iv) this Agreement, any other
agreement, certificate or other document entered into pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the failure of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or the termination of
this Agreement, in each case, including in any Action under any legal theory,
whether sounding in law (whether for breach of contract, in tort or otherwise)
or in equity (the items referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv),
the " ** _Potential Claims_** "). No Company Group Member shall be entitled to
bring, and neither the Company, the Lenders Representative nor any Company
Group Member shall bring, and shall in no event support, facilitate, encourage
or take any action other than opposing, the bringing of, any Action against
any Buyer Group Member with respect to, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any Potential Claim and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any then pending Potential Claim against a Buyer
Group Member to be dismissed with prejudice as promptly as practicable after
such termination (and in no event later than (3) days following such
termination).

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the " ** _Company Group_** " means,
collectively, the Company, the Stockholders, the Lenders, the Lenders
Representative and each of their respective former, current or future
Affiliates, equity owners, officers, directors and representatives, and each
of the foregoing Persons shall be a " ** _Company Group Member_** " and (ii)
the " ** _Buyer Group_** " shall mean, collectively, (x) Buyer and Merger Sub,
(y) the Financing Sources and (z) any of the respective former, current, or
future Affiliates of the Persons identified in the immediately foregoing
clauses (x) and (y), general partners, limited partners, equity owners,
controlling persons and Representatives of any the Persons identified in the
immediately foregoing clauses (x) and (y) or any such Affiliate (and each such
Person shall be a " ** _Buyer Group Member_** ").

 **9.1** **_Survival_**. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company, the Lenders Representative and Buyer, contained in

9.1_.

four (4) years following the Closing Date (the " ** _Special Indemnity

expiration of the applicable Survival Period will be void and invalid. Any

applicable Survival Period will survive such expiration until resolved.

 



 

 **9.2** [ ** _Reserved_**.]

 



 

 **9.3** **_Indemnification by the Lenders_**. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article IX_, (including the provisions of _Section 9.1_),
from and after the Closing, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and their respective officers,
employees, directors and stockholders (collectively, the " ** _Buyer
Indemnitees_** ") will be entitled to reimbursement from the Lenders for any
Losses incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnitees following the Closing arising
out of or as a result of:

 



 

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
regarding the Company contained in _Article IV_ (including the Schedules
related thereto) that are not Fundamental Representations;

 



 

(b) any breach of or inaccuracy in any Fundamental Representations;

 



       
 

 



 

(c) any breach of the covenants or agreements of the Lenders Representative
or the Company (but, in the case of the Company, solely with regard to pre-
Closing breaches) contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(d) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for Pre-Closing Tax Periods;

 



 

(e) any claims of any current or former holders of Company Capital Stock,
including relating to (i) the allocation of, or entitlement to a portion of,
the Merger Consideration, (ii) the adoption of the MIP, the calculation of the
Incentive Plan Bonus Amount and payment of all or a portion of the Incentive

contractual, employment or other rights to capital stock of the Company or
other payments or claims for damages based on any such rights, including any
Losses arising or resulting from any indemnification obligations of the
Company to any officer, director or other Person, pursuant the Companys
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other Contract arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby (except as actually satisfied by recovery
from the DandO Tail);

 



 

(f) any inaccuracy in the MIP Allocation Schedule or amounts set forth in
_Section 2.3(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_;

 



 

(g) the exercise of any appraisal or dissenters rights or any other equitable
remedy (including quasi-appraisal) with respect to the Merger by any holder of

(h) any Selling Expenses, Company Debt outstanding as of the Closing or 2015
Annual Bonuses, in each case, not paid at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

 **9.4** **_Exclusive Remedy_**. The Parties agree that, from and after the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for any Losses based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements)
and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract tort,
equity or Law, are the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of the
parties set forth in this _Article IX_. The provisions of this _Section 9.4_
shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action under _Section 9.8_ to
obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, or the arbitration
proceedings under _Section 2.3_.

 



 

 **9.5** [ ** _Reserved_**.]

 



 

 **9.6** **_Limitations on Indemnification Payments to Buyer Indemnitees_**.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the rights of the
Buyer Indemnitees are limited as follows:

 



 

(a) _Basket_. The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to assert any claims
for Losses arising with respect to the matters described in _Section 9.3(a)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses suffered by the Buyer
Indemnitees with respect to such matters exceeds $850,000 (the " ** _Basket_**
"), and then only to the extent of the Losses in excess of the Basket.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Claim Threshold_. With respect to claims for indemnity pursuant to
_Section 9.3(a)_, the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to assert any
claims for Losses with respect to any individual item or matter, or items or
matters arising out of substantially similar facts and circumstances, unless
and until the amount of Losses with respect to such item(s) or matter(s)
exceeds $25,000 (" ** _Threshold Amount_** "), and if such Threshold Amount is
not exceeded, none of the Losses with respect to such item(s) or matter(s)
will count toward satisfying the Basket.

 



 

(c) _Source of Payment_.

 



 

(i) In pursuing the collection of any claims for Losses pursuant to _Section
9.3_, the Buyer Indemnitees may provide a Buyer Claim Notice to the Lenders
Representative and the Escrow Agent and may proceed against the Indemnity
Escrow Funds for the amount of such Losses in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, but not against any Lender directly, except as provided in
_Section 9.6(c)(ii)_ below.

 



 

(ii) After the Indemnity Escrow Funds have been either released or exhausted
(and with respect to claims under _Section 9.3(b)_ and _Section 9.3(d)_
after the RandW Insurance Policy has been exhausted, to the extent available to
cover such matters), the Buyer Indemnitees may proceed against the Lenders
directly for an aggregate of up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Merger
Consideration received by the Lenders for any Losses incurred by any of the
Buyer Indemnitees following the Closing arising out of or as a result of any
of the matters set forth in _Sections 9.3(b)-(h)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) no Lender shall be liable for more than its pro rata share of any
Loss as set forth on _Schedule 9.6(c)(ii)_ and (y) no Lender shall be liable
in respect of any Buyer Claim or Third Party Claim pursuant to _Sections
9.3(b)-(h)_ unless made on or prior to the Special Indemnity Expiration Date
(it being understood, for further clarity, that any pending Buyer Claims or
Third Party Claims brought pursuant to _Sections 9.3(b)-(h)_ on or prior to
the Special Indemnity Expiration Date will survive until resolved).

 



 

(iii) Each Buyer Indemnitees first source of recovery for any indemnity
obligation under _Section 9.3_ of this Agreement shall first be the Indemnity
Escrow Funds until all of the Indemnity Escrow Funds have been released or
exhausted and, for the avoidance of doubt, each Buyer Indemnitees sole source
of recovery from the Indemnifying Parties for any indemnity obligation under
_Section 9.3(a)_ shall be the Indemnity Escrow Funds.

 



 

(d) _Third Party Payment Offset_. The Buyer Indemnitees rights pursuant to
_Section 9.3_ on account of any Losses will be reduced by all insurance or
other third party indemnification or contribution proceeds actually received
by any of the Buyer Indemnitees. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to claim and recover any Losses suffered by any of the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_, _Section 9.3(b)_ and _Section
9.3(d)_ under the RandW Insurance Policy after the Indemnity Escrow Funds have
been either released or exhausted. The Buyer Indemnitees shall remit to the
Lenders Representative (for the benefit of the Lenders) any such insurance or
other third

 



      
 

 



 

party proceeds that are paid to any of the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to
Losses for which any of the Buyer Indemnitees has been previously compensated
pursuant to _Section 9.3_, net of reasonable collection costs and increased
insurance premiums as a result thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any
proceeds received by any Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy after the exhaustion of the retention under such policy shall not be
required to be paid to the Lenders pursuant to this _Section 9.6(d)_, unless
and to the extent such proceeds are in duplication of amounts received by any
Buyer Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Funds or any Lender.

 



 

(e) **_Tax Benefits_. **The Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.3_ on account of any Losses will be reduced by the net
amount of the Tax Benefit (defined below) actually realized or received by any
of the Buyer Indemnitees or their Affiliates as a result of a Loss (net of any
costs incurred in connection with recovery of such Tax Benefit). For purposes
of the foregoing, "Tax Benefit" means any reduction in any Tax realized as a
result of a Loss equal to the positive difference, if any, between (i) the
liability of the Buyer Indemnitees or their Affiliates for Taxes in the year
the Loss is incurred not taking into account such Loss and (ii) the liability
of the Buyer Indemnitees or their Affiliates for Taxes in such year taking
into account the Loss and taking into account any taxable income realized by
the Buyer Indemnitees or their Affiliates on account of such Loss or
indemnification payment, with the Loss treated as the last item of expense or
deduction realized for such year.

 



 

(f) _Losses_. The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recovery under
_Section 9.3_ for punitive damages except if actually awarded in respect of a
Third Party Claim.

 



 

(g) _Adjustments_. The Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recovery
under _Section 9.3_ for Losses to the extent that any Buyer Indemnitee has
already been compensated therefor pursuant to _Section 2.3_. The Buyer
Indemnitees will not have the right to indemnification under this Agreement
for any Losses to the extent such Losses are based on Taxes: (i) attributable
to taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date;
(ii) that are due to the unavailability in any taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, capital
loss or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
on or prior to the Closing Date (unless as a result of any breach of _Section
4.6(c)_); (iii) resulting from transactions or actions taken by Buyer, the
Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates after the Closing that
are not contemplated by this Agreement and are outside the ordinary course of
business; or (iv) that result from Buyers breach of any of the covenants
contained in _Article X_.

 



 

(h) _Same Loss_. The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to be compensated
more than once for the same Loss, including with respect to amounts accounted
for in the Final Working Capital.

 



 

(i) _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
for purposes of this _Article IX_, and solely with respect to the calculation
of Losses (and not for purposes of determining whether a breach or inaccuracy
has occurred) each

 



      
 

 



 

representation and warranty in this Agreement and the schedules hereto shall
be read without regard and without giving effect to the term "material" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases contained in such representation
or warranty.

 



 

 **9.7** **_Claims Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) [ _Reserved_.]

 



 

(b) _Losses by Buyer Indemnitee_.

 



 

(i) __Claims with Determinable Losses__. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this _Article IX_, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith that it
has a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.3_ (a " ** _Buyer
Claim_** "), the amount of which is then known, Buyer shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of such Buyer Claim, notify the
Lenders Representative of such Buyer Claim by means of a written notice
describing the Buyer Claim in reasonable detail and setting forth Buyers good
faith calculation of the Losses incurred by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee
with respect thereto (a " ** _Buyer Claim Notice_** "). If, by the thirtieth
(30th) day following receipt by the Lenders Representative of a Buyer Claim
Notice (the " ** _Dispute Period_** "), Buyer has not received from the
Lenders Representative notice in writing that the Lenders Representative
objects to the Buyer Claim (or the amount of Losses set forth in the Buyer
Claim) asserted in such Buyer Claim Notice (a " ** _Dispute Notice_** "),
then, if such Buyer Claim shall have been made prior to the Indemnity Escrow
Termination Date, Buyer and the Lenders Representative shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to
Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Funds the amount of Losses specified in the
Buyer Claim Notice subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_.

 



 

(ii) __Claims without Determinable Losses__. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article IX_, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith
that it has a Buyer Claim the amount of which cannot reasonably be determined,
Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of such
Buyer Claim, notify the Lenders Representative by means of a Buyer Claim
Notice that contains the information required by _Section 9.7(b)(i)_ and a
good faith estimate, if possible, of Buyers calculation of the Losses
incurred by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee with respect to such Buyer Claim.
If Buyer has not received a Dispute Notice from the Lenders Representative
within the Dispute Period, then, if such Buyer Claim shall have been made
prior to the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the Lenders Representative
and Buyer shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Funds
the amount of Losses specified from time-to-time as the amount of any such
Buyer Claim becomes known, subject to the limitations contained in this
_Article IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Lenders Representative will
be under no obligation to agree to any such payments under the immediately
preceding clause and the making of any one such payment will

 



      
 

 



 

be without prejudice to the continuing right of the Lenders Representative to
object to any further payment.

 



 

(iii) __Claim Disputes__. If the Lenders Representative delivers a Dispute
Notice to Buyer within the Dispute Period, Buyer and the Lenders
Representative shall promptly meet and use their reasonable efforts to settle
the dispute as to whether and to what extent the Buyer Indemnitees are
entitled to reimbursement on account of such Buyer Claim. If Buyer and the
Lenders Representative are able to reach agreement within thirty (30) days
after Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then, if such Buyer Claim shall have
been made prior to the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, Buyer and the
Lenders Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent setting forth such agreement and instructing the Escrow Agent to
pay to Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Funds an amount in accordance with such
agreement, subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_. If
Buyer and the Lenders Representative are unable to reach agreement within
thirty (30) days after Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then either Buyer,
on the one hand, or the Lenders Representative on the other hand, may resort
to other legal remedies, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
IX_.

 



 

(c) _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) __Control of Defense__. Subject to _Section 10.2_, in the event of any
claim by a third party for which indemnification is available under _Section
9.3_ (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), Lenders Representative (on behalf of
the Lenders) (" ** _Indemnifying Party_** "), has the right, exercisable by
written notice to Buyer within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Buyer Claim
Notice, to assume and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to Buyer.
If the Indemnifying Party has assumed such defense as provided in this
_Section 9.7(c)_, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with the
defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
9.7(c)_, the Indemnitee may continue to defend such Third Party Claim at the
sole cost of the Indemnifying Party (subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article IX_) and the Indemnifying Party may still participate in, but
not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to a settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnitee will not
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, no Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of any such Third Party Claim, will consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (i) provides for injunctive
or other nonmonetary relief affecting the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitee, (ii) contains an admission of a violation of any criminal Law or
(iii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each
claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release from all liability with
respect to such claim or litigation. In any such Third Party Claim, the party
responsible for the defense of such Third Party Claim (the " ** _Controlling
Party_** ") shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, keep
such other party informed as to the status of such Third Party Claim,
including all settlement negotiations and offers. With respect to a Third
Party Claim for which the Lenders Representative is the party responsible for
the defense, Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to make available to the
Lenders Representative and its representatives all books and records of Buyer
and the Company relating to such Third Party Claim and shall cooperate with
the Lenders Representative in the defense of the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(ii) _Settlement_. The Controlling Party shall promptly notify the other party
of each settlement offer with respect to a Third Party Claim. Such other party
shall promptly notify the Controlling Party whether or not such party is
willing to accept the proposed settlement offer. If the Lenders
Representative is willing to accept the proposed settlement offer but Buyer
refuses to accept such settlement offer, then if (i) such settlement offer
requires only the payment of money damages and provides a complete release of
all Indemnitees that are a party to such Third Party Claim with respect to the
subject matter thereof, (ii) the Lenders Representative agrees in writing
that the entire amount of such proposed settlement constitutes Losses that are
recoverable from the Indemnity Escrow Funds then available for distribution,
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, and (iii) the amount of
such proposed settlement will not exceed the limitations contained in this
_Article IX_, then the amount payable to the Indemnitees with respect to such
Third Party Claim will be limited to the amount of such settlement offer
subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_. The Lenders
Representative may nevertheless propose in writing a good faith, reasonable
settlement offer that requires only the payment of money damages and provides
a complete release of all Indemnitees who are parties to such Third Party
Claim with respect to the subject matter thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) the Lenders Representative agrees in writing that the entire amount
of such proposed settlement constitutes Losses that are reimbursable from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds then available for distribution, subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount of any such proposed
settlement offer may not exceed the limitations contained in this _Article
IX_. If Buyer refuses to agree to or make the proposed settlement offer to the
claimant in the Third Party Claim, any amount payable to a Buyer Indemnitee
with respect to such Third Party Claim will be limited to the amount of such
proposed settlement offer. If any such settlement offer is made to any
claimant and rejected by such claimant, the amount payable to an Indemnitee
with respect to such Third Party Claim will not be limited to the amount of
such settlement offer but will remain subject to all other limitations set
forth in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Releases of Indemnity Escrow Funds_. All Indemnity Escrow Funds held
under the Escrow Agreement _minus_ the amounts of any unresolved Buyer Claims
set forth in any then pending Buyer Claim Notices shall be released to the
Lenders Representative on the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " ** _Indemnity Escrow Termination Date_** ").

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_. For all purposes of this _Article IX_ (including those
pertaining to disputes under this _Section 9.7_), Buyer and the Lenders
Representative shall cooperate with and make available to the other Party and
its respective representatives all information, records and data, and shall
permit reasonable access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the resolution of such disputes.

 



 

 **9.8** **_Specific Performance_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party hereto shall be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party hereto of any
one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any Party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. In
accordance with the foregoing it is agreed that the Parties, including Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company, or if after the Effective Time, the Lenders
Representative, shall be, entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, and the Parties hereby waive the requirement
of any posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein. For
the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the Company
(collectively, with all of their Affiliates) be entitled to both a full and
actually realized grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies of
the sort described in this _Section 9.8_ and any monetary damages, including
payment of all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee (other than
payment of any amounts pursuant to _Section 6.7_ and _Section 8.2(d)_, if
applicable). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that neither the Lenders nor the Lenders Representative
shall be entitled to specific performance of Buyers obligation to cause the
Debt Financing to be funded; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, if the proceeds of the Debt Financing are available in full to
Buyer, the Company and the Lenders Representative may seek specific
performance of Buyers obligations to consummate the transaction subject to
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2._

 



 

 **9.9** **_Subrogation_**. Upon making any indemnity payment pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_, as applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee, as applicable, against any
third party in respect of the Losses to which the payment is related. The
Parties will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.10** **_Adjustment to Merger Consideration_**. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ and all payments made pursuant to
_Section 9.12_ will be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

 **9.11** **_Effect of Investigation_**. The right to indemnification, payment
of Losses or for other remedies based on any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation of Lenders contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
date the Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.
The waiver of any condition to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, where such condition is based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Losses, or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

 



 

 **9.12** **_Rebate Obligations_**. Buyer may, at Buyers sole discretion,
settle or pay any Rebate Obligation at any time, and from time to time, during
the three (3) year period immediately following the Closing (the " ** _Rebate
Escrow Period_** "), by providing written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent
(with a copy to the Lenders Representative) (i) describing the Rebate
Obligation and the amount so settled, paid or to be paid (each a " ** _Rebate
Amount_** "), in reasonable detail and (ii) instructing the Escrow Agent to
release to Buyer an amount equal to such Rebate Amount from the Rebate Escrow
Funds (" ** _Rebate Escrow Release Notice_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , (x)
Buyer will not be entitled to receive any Rebate Amount from the Rebate Escrow
Funds unless and until the aggregate amount of all Rebate Obligations actually
paid by Buyer without utilization of any Rebate Escrow Funds has exceeded
$500,000 and (y) Buyer shall provide at least three (3) Business Days advance
written notice to the Lenders Representative that it intends to deliver a
Rebate Escrow Release Notice before delivering a Rebate Escrow Release Notice.
Within two (2) Business Days after the expiration of the Rebate Escrow Period,
Buyer and the Lenders Representative shall deliver joint written instructions
signed by Buyer and the Lenders Representative, instructing the Escrow Agent
to pay and deliver all then-remaining Rebate Escrow Funds minus the amounts of
any unpaid Rebate Amounts set forth in any then pending Rebate Escrow Release
Notice to the Lenders Representative within five (5) Business Days after
delivery thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Buyer Indemnitees sole source of recovery for
any Rebate Obligations shall be the Rebate Escrow Funds.

TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **10.1** **_Cooperation; Audits; Tax Returns_**.

 



 

(a) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations and
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities
imposed on the Company and the Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (" ** _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_** "), Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Lenders Representative,

 



      
 

 



 

on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including the
furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records,
personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or
other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns,
the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing
Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. Buyer shall and shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries to (i) retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Lenders
Representative, any extension thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (ii) give the Lenders Representative reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and
shall allow the Lenders Representative to take possession of such books and
records.

 



 

(b) Buyer and the Lenders Representative shall, upon the others request, use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(c) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Company
or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Straddle Period. All

approve all such Tax Returns prior to their filing, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall provide Lenders
Representative with final copies of all such Tax Returns after they are filed.

comment or approval at least fifteen (15) days before the due date for such
Tax Returns including any applicable extensions. Buyer shall revise such Tax
Returns to reflect any reasonable comments by Lenders Representative. Buyer
shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax Returns. In the case of
any Taxes relating to any Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (the " ** _Straddle Period_** "), the portion of such Tax which
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other
than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period,
and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains or
receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.

Period or Straddle Period shall be for the account of Buyer including, but not
limited to, a refund of any overpayment of estimated Taxes or refund related
to the carryback of any losses arising out of the Transaction Deductions.

 



      
 

 



 

 **10.2** **_Controversies_**. Notwithstanding _Section 9.7(c)_, Buyer shall
control any inquiries, assessments, proceedings or similar events with respect
to Taxes. Buyer shall promptly notify the Lenders Representative (a) upon
receipt by Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer of any notice of any Tax Matter
from any Taxing Authority or (b) prior to Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary
initiating any Tax Matter with any Taxing Authority. The Lenders
Representative may, at the Lenders expense, participate in any such Tax
Matter. The Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely affects the
Lenders without the prior written consent of the Lenders Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The
Buyer shall keep the Lenders Representative informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Matter, and will, in good
faith, allow the Lenders Representative to consult with it regarding the
conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.

 



 

 **10.3** **_Amendment of Tax Returns_**. Except as required by Applicable
Law, none of Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall amend, re-
file, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of any of the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period without the prior written consent of the Lenders Representative, such
consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

 



 

 **10.4** **_Certain Taxes_**. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, " ** _Transfer Taxes_** ") will be paid one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Lenders when due, and all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed
by the Party required to file such Tax Returns under applicable Law.

(i) any amount that may be payable by such Lender hereunder or (ii) any costs,
fees, expenses and other liabilities incurred by the Lenders or Lenders
Representative (in its capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement and
other agreements and documents executed and delivered in connection herewith
or its or their rights or obligations hereunder or thereunder. Buyer agrees to
confirm the termination of employment to the Lenders Representative of any
employee of Buyer (or its Affiliates) who provides written authorization to

(b) At any time Lenders that upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement
held at least seventy percent (70%) of the debt outstanding under the Credit

appoint another Person as Lenders Representative. Notice together with a copy
of the written consent appointing such Person and bearing the signatures of
Persons representing the Lender Supermajority must be delivered to Buyer and,
if applicable, the Escrow Agent not less than ten (10) days prior to such

such consent is received by Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(c) The Lenders Representative will not be liable for any act done or omitted
under this Agreement as Lenders Representative while acting in good faith,
and any act taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel

agrees that it will not look to the

 



      
 

 



 

personal assets of the Lenders Representative, acting in such capacity, for
the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Company (pre-
Closing) or the Lender. In performing any of its duties under this Agreement
or any agreements or documents executed and delivered in connection herewith,
the Lenders Representative will not be liable to the Lenders for any Losses
that such Person may incur as a result of any act, or failure to act, by the
Lenders Representative under this Agreement or any agreements or documents
executed and delivered in connection herewith, and the Lenders Representative
will be indemnified and held harmless by the Lenders for all Losses, except to
the extent that the actions or omissions of the Lenders Representative were
taken or omitted not in good faith. The limitation of liability provisions of
this _Section 11.1(c)_ will survive the termination of this Agreement and the
resignation of the Lenders Representative.

 



 

(d) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Lender, and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger. The provisions of this _Section 11.1_ shall be binding upon the
executors, heirs, legal representatives, successor and assigns of each Lender,
and any references in this Agreement to any Lender shall mean and include the
successors to such Persons rights hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 



 

 **11.2** **_Expenses_**. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses (including all legal, accounting, broker, finder or investment banker
fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are to be paid, in the case of the Company, by the Company
(if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated), or
will be treated as Selling Expenses (if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated) to the extent unpaid at the Closing, and in the
case of Buyer or Merger Sub, by Buyer or Merger Sub.

 



 

 **11.3** **_Successors and Assigns_**. This Agreement is binding upon and
inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, but is not assignable by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
after the Closing, Buyer may assign all of its rights to payment under this
Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing
to Buyer pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, but no such assignment shall
relieve Buyer of any liability or obligation hereunder.

 



 

 **11.4** **_Third Party Beneficiaries_**. Except as set forth in _Sections
6.5_, _9.2_ , _9.3_ , _11.1_ , _11.15_ and _11.16_ each Party hereto intends
that this Agreement does not benefit or create any right or cause of action in
or on behalf of any Person other than the Parties hereto; _provided_ that the
provisions of _Section 8.2(e)_, _Section 11.9_, _Section 11.10_, _Section
11.11_ and _Section 11.16_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the Financing Sources and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third party
beneficiary of such Sections.

 



 

 **11.5** **_Further Assurances_**. The Parties shall execute such further
instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be necessary to
carry out the intent of this Agreement.

obligations herein provided.

whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) such Lenders and

from the Company and any Subsidiary any email, document and other records
containing attorney-client privileged information where the attorney-client
privilege is held jointly between one or more of the Company and any
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Lenders and their Affiliates on the other
hand, solely as such may relate to the transactions contemplated herein (" **
_Jointly Privileged Information_** "). From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
cause the Company, the Surviving Company and each Subsidiary to provide to the
Lenders Representative all copies (including electronic, digital, or
otherwise) of any Jointly Privileged Information that is inadvertently not
removed prior to the Closing. The Lenders Representative agrees that any
