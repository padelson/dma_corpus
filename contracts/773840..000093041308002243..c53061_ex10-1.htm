payable in respect of such Option as provided herein, and (c) that no Options may be exercised after the Closing and (ii) shall take all other actions permitted under the Stock Option Plan so that effective as of the Closing all Options then
outstanding shall be cancelled at the Closing and represent only the right to receive the Closing Option Per Share Consideration and the Additional Per Share Consideration. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek to have each holder of an Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (other than Rollover Employees that entered into an option cancellation agreement on or prior to the date of this Agreement) enter into an
option cancellation agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as </FONT><U><FONT face="serif">Exhibit E</FONT></U><FONT face="serif"> (with appropriate modifications for the Options described on </FONT><U><FONT face="serif">Section
