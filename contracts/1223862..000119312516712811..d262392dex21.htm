or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent permitted under this
Agreement) of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ (as they may be amended
from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, collectively, the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, at any time,
to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the

adversely affect, the Company or the Company Stockholders or in any manner
that delays or interferes with, hinders or impairs the consummation of the
Offer.

 

(b) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight (New York City time) at the end of the date
that is 20 business days (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) following (and including the day of) the commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (such time, or
such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Time_ ," and such date, or
such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ that:

(i) if at the previously-scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition shall
not have been satisfied or waived by Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent

 



2  permitted under this Agreement), Merger Sub may, in its discretion (and
without the consent of the Company or any other Person), and if requested by
the Company, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend
and re-extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of 10 Business
Days each (or such longer or shorter period as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree) until all such Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or
waived;

(ii) Merger Sub may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company
or any other Person), extend the Offer beyond any then-scheduled Expiration
Time for one or more consecutive increments of five (5) Business Days each (or
such other period as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) if (A) _ _
Parent and Merger Sub shall have waived the Financing Proceeds Condition, (B)
all of the Offer Conditions other than the Financing Proceeds Condition have
been satisfied or waived, (other than the Minimum Tender Condition which need
not be satisfied at such time and other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) and (C) the Debt Financing (or any
alternative financing contemplated by _Section 4.5_ ) has not actually been
received by Merger Sub or Parent;

(iii) if (A) the Financing Proceeds Condition has been satisfied or waived
less than five Business Days prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date and
(B) all of the other Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived (to the
extent permitted under this Agreement) at or prior to the then-scheduled
Expiration Time (other than the Minimum Tender Condition which need not be
satisfied at such time and other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), then Merger Sub and Parent shall have a one-time
right to extend the Expiration Time for a period of five Business Days (or
such longer or shorter period as Parent and the Company may mutually agree);

 

(iv) (A) subject to applicable Laws, Merger Sub may at any time extend the
Offer for any period agreed by Parent and the Company, (B) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.1_ , Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date or the date
of valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and
(C) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or NYSE
applicable to the Offer or as may be required by any other Governmental
Authority; and

 

(v) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Company on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, brings or shall have brought any
action in accordance with _Section 7.7_ to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by the other Party,
the Expiration Time shall be extended (A) for the period during which such
action is pending or (B) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, as the case may be, but in any event, not past the
Outside Date or the date of valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

 

(c) _Consummation of the Offer_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof (including the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions) and
applicable Law, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i)

3  the business day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)

irrevocably accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the time of the acceptance for payment, the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) promptly pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable, and in any event not more than three Business Days after the
Offer Acceptance Time (such time scheduled for payment for Shares accepted for

as the " _Offer Closing_ "). The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid net to the seller
thereof in cash, without interest and subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof. Prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub

becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer,
and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of its obligations under this
Agreement.

of the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof or a valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_ , Merger Sub shall not terminate or
withdraw the Offer or permit the Offer to expire without the prior written
consent of the Company. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Article VI_ , prior to any scheduled expiration
thereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, immediately,
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and not acquire any Shares
pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub in

cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered
Shares to the registered holders thereof in accordance with the terms of the
Offer and applicable Law.

summary advertisement and other ancillary offer documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and documents,
together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, collectively,
the " _Offer Documents_ "), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to the Company Stockholders as and to the extent required by applicable Law.
The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub the information

Company Stockholders, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and as

promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or
any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer
Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between them and the Parent Representatives, on the one hand,

filed after a Change of Board Recommendation, prior to the filing of any
Offer Documents with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the Company
Stockholders, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents

to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 Documents and to cause the Schedule 14D-9
Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as soon as reasonably
practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC,
or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Schedule
14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the

Parent, Merger Sub and Parent Representatives (x) shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files and will use

Parent and the applicable award holders, each Company Option that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the

number of Shares subject to such Company Option multiplied by (B) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the applicable per share
exercise price under such Company Option, subject to any required withholding
of Taxes. If the

 



7  per share exercise price of any such Company Option is equal to or greater
than the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be
cancelled pursuant to this _Section 1.7(a)(iv)_ without payment of
consideration.

(v) _Company RSUs_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or Parent
and the applicable award holders, Company RSUs shall be treated as follows:

(1) _Vested Company RSUs_. Each Vested Company RSU shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, subject to any required withholding of Taxes.

 

(2) _Additional Vesting Company RSUs_. Each Additional Vesting Company RSU
shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to any required withholding of Taxes.

(3) _Unvested Company RSUs_. Each Unvested Company RSU shall be cancelled and

(i) the amount of the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cash Replacement
Company RSU Amounts_ "), which Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts will,
subject to the holders continued employment with the Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through
the applicable vesting dates (excluding accelerated vesting on specific
terminations of employment, to the extent applicable), vest and be payable at
the same time as the Unvested Company RSUs for which such Cash Replacement
RSU Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms . All Cash
Replacement Company RSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions
(including, with respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting on
specific terminations of employment, to the extent applicable)) as applied to
the Unvested Company RSUs for which they were exchanged, except for terms
rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the
reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform
the administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts).

 

(vi) _Company MSUs_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or Parent
and the applicable award holders, Company MSUs shall be treated as follows:

Company MSU immediately prior to the 

 



8  Effective Time (the " _Cash Replacement Company MSU Amounts_ ," and,
together with the Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts, the " _Cash
Replacement Amounts_ "), which Cash Replacement Company MSU Amounts will,
subject to the holders continued employment with the Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through
the applicable vesting dates (excluding accelerated vesting on specific
terminations of employment, to the extent applicable), vest and be payable at
the same time as the Unvested Company MSUs for which such Cash Replacement MSU
Amounts were exchanged would have vested pursuant to its terms. All
Cash Replacement Company MSU Amounts will have the same terms and conditions
(including, with respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting on specific
terminations of employment, to the extent applicable)) as applied to the
Unvested Company MSUs for which they were exchanged, except for terms
rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes as in the
reasonable and good faith determination of Parent are appropriate to conform
the administration of the Cash Replacement Company MSU Amounts.

(4) _Forfeited Company MSUs_. All Forfeited Company MSUs shall be immediately
forfeited for no consideration.

(vii) _Order of Preference and Selection_. The determination of which Company
RSUs and Company MSUs held by any individual holder thereof that will be
converted into Additional Vesting Awards shall be based on the relative
vesting dates of the Company RSUs and Company MSUs held by such individual
such that, for the avoidance of doubt and for purposes of clarity, such
holders Cash Replacement Company RSU Amounts and Cash Replacement Company MSU
Amounts shall be granted in exchange for Company RSUs and Company MSUs with
the longest remaining vesting periods as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(viii) _Payroll Distribution_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing Date (but no later than the earlier of (x) the second payroll
date after the Closing Date or (y) the 15th Business Day after the Closing
Date), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable with respect to each of the Company Options, Vested Company RSUs,
Additional Vesting Company RSUs, Vested Company MSUs, and Additional Vesting
Company MSUs (collectively, the " _Cash-Out Awards_ ") as the case may be, in
accordance with Section 1.7(a)(iv), Section 1.7(a)(v) and Section 1.7(a)(vi),
respectively, through the Surviving Corporations payroll to the applicable
holders of such Cash-Out Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment
owed to a holder of Cash-Out Awards pursuant to this Section 1.7 cannot be
made through the Companys or the Surviving Corporations payroll system or
payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such
payment to such holder, which check will be sent by courier to such holder no
later than the second payroll date after the Closing Date. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the applicable vesting dates (but no later than
the earlier of (x) the second payroll date after such applicable vesting date
or (y) the 15th Business Day after such vesting date), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the applicable portion of the Cash Replacement Amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 1.7 with respect to each Unvested Award to
the applicable holders thereof.

(ix) _Merger Sub_. Each share of the Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per

9 (b) The Company will take all action necessary to effect the cancellation and,
if applicable, replacement of the Company Options, Company RSUs, and Company
MSUs pursuant to this _Section 1.7_ upon the Effective Time and to generally
give effect to _Section 1.7(a)_, _(a)(iv)_ , _Section 1.7(a)(iv)(1)_ , and 
_(a)(vi)_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in any
Company Equity or other Company Benefit Plan will have any right thereunder
to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

(c) If, during the period from the Agreement Date through the Effective Time,
any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction occurs with respect to the outstanding Shares, or if
a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a
record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period,
then all calculations provided for that are based on a number of shares of any
class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, including the
Offer Price, the Per Share Merger Consideration, shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 1.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
owned by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and
shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 1.10(f)_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time (unless required by Law), the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration made available to the
Paying Agent to pay for Company Common Stock that have become Dissenting
Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 



10 Section 1.9 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time: (a) all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable therefor in accordance
with  _Section 1.7_, or in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights
pursuant to _Section 1.8_, and all holders of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as Company Stockholders except as provided for in _Section 1.7_ or
_Section 1.8_, as applicable, and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Shares shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ")
is presented to the Paying Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as
provided in  _Section 1.10_.

Section 1.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in
the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Promptly following the Effective Time
(but in any event on the Closing Date), Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to make all payments to holders of Shares pursuant to
_Section 1.7_. The cash amounts so deposited with the Paying Agent are
referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Company Stock Certificate or shares of non-certificated Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each
case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificates or transfer
of the Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Paying Agent, and
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent, the
Company and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(c) Upon the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form in accordance with the
instructions thereto, with respect to such Company Stock Certificates or an
agents message in the case of a book entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Company Stock Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share
pursuant to the terms of this

 



11  Agreement. Any Company Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Company Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated hereby, each Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
1.10_, if any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the
Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and
subject to _Section 1.10(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Per Share Merger
Consideration as set forth in _Section 1.7_.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Common Stock as of the one year anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore surrendered their Shares in accordance with this 
_Section 1.10_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their
claims for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(f) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any equityholders or former
equityholders such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from
such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect
to any cash amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

 

Section 1.11 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the

 



12  purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

assuming the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the

pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
by each of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable
principles.

the Transactions pursuant to any employment, compensation, severance,
retention or other employee benefit arrangements have been approved as
contemplated by Rule 14d-10 of the Exchange Act for the purpose of satisfying

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ ") (with the disclosure in any section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter being deemed to qualify or apply to other sections and
subsections of this _Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable
should qualify or apply to such other sections and subsections of this
_Article III_ ), Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally,
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 3.1 _Corporate Existence_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and
has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
Merger Sub are each duly qualified to do business and are each in good
standing (to the extent a concept of "good standing" is applicable in the
case of any jurisdiction outside the United States) in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, are in full force and effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
in violation of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, except where such
violation would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub have all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which it is a

and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and all other

performance of Parent and Merger Sub of their respective obligations hereunder
and thereunder, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger
Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
are necessary to adopt or authorize this Agreement, the performance of their
respective obligations hereunder or to consummate the Transactions. This
Agreement has been validly executed and delivered by 

 



32  Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally, and general equitable principles.

Section 3.3 _Governmental Approvals and Consents; Non-Contravention_.

 

(a) Assuming the conditions of Section 251(h) of the DGCL have been satisfied,
no Consent, order, or license from, notice to or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except

SEC of such other reports required in connection with the Offer or the Merger
under, and such other compliance with, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (iii) for
required Consents under any applicable Antitrust Laws, and (iv) such other
Consents, the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of its respective obligations hereunder
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions do not and
will not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of the respective
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents of
Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) result in any violation or breach of or constitute
any default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or a loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien
under any Contract to which Parent and/or Merger Sub is subject or is a party,
or (iii) assuming compliance with the matters described in _Section 3.3(a)_
and  _Section 4.4_, violate, conflict with or result in any breach under any
provision of any Law applicable to Parent or any of its properties or assets,
except, in the case of subclauses (ii) and (iii), where such
violation, breach, conflict, default, right of termination or cancellation,
acceleration, loss of benefit, failure to obtain Consent would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.4 _Litigation_. As of the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates is subject to any order, judgment, stipulation, injunction,
decree of or agreement with any Governmental Authority, which would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially interfere with or delay the consummation
of any of the Transactions or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the Agreement Date, no Proceeding is pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of
its Affiliates which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



33 Section 3.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of
(i) the executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, by
and among Merger Sub and the financial institutions party thereto (the "
_Lenders_ "; _provided_ that for purposes of this Agreement, the Lenders shall
also include, after the date hereof, any financial institutions that become
party to the Debt Commitment Letter (as defined below) in accordance with
_Section 4.5(c)_ or to any alternative financing effected in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 4.5(b)_), including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto (as amended, restated, replaced, substituted,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in accordance with _Section
4.5(c)_ or, in the case of an alternative financing, in accordance with
_Section 4.5(b)_, (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Merger Sub for the purpose of funding
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions (such committed debt
financing, together with, unless the context otherwise requires, any debt
securities issued in lieu thereof, the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii)
an executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, by and
among Parent and Sponsor, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments thereto (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the
Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which, and
subject to the terms and conditions of which, Sponsor has committed to provide
the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding the Offer
and the Merger (such committed equity financing, the " _Equity Financing_ "
and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ").

 

(b) As of the Agreement Date, the Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect and (ii) each of the Commitment Letters, in
the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent or
Merger Sub, the other parties thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the
case may be, in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be
affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally, and general equitable principles. Except for fee letters with
respect to fees and related arrangements with respect to the Debt Financing
(the " _Debt Fee Letter_ "), of which Parent has delivered true, accurate and
complete copies to the Company on or prior to the Agreement Date (with only
fee amounts, pricing caps, "market flex" terms and certain economic terms
(none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability or
conditionality of the Debt Financing) redacted) and the Limited Guarantee, the
Commitment Letters are the only agreements relating to the Financing as of the
Agreement Date. Other than as expressly set forth in such Commitment Letters
and the Debt Fee Letter, there are no other agreements, side letters, or
arrangements relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment
Letter that could affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the
Debt Financing or the Equity Financing. The Equity Commitment Letter provides
that the Company is an express third-party beneficiary in connection with
Parents exercise of its rights under _Section 7.7_, and that Parent agrees
not to oppose the grant of an injunction, specific performance or other
equity relief in connection with the exercise of such third party rights.

 

(c) Assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions (other than the
Financing Proceeds Condition) and the conditions set forth in  _Section
5.1_, as of the Agreement

 



34  Date, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, under any term of the Commitment Letters or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, would (i) make any of the assumptions or
any of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letters inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in the Commitment
Letters not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Financing not
being available on the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, no Lender party
to any Debt Commitment Letter has notified Parent or Merger Sub of
its intention to terminate any of the commitments under such Debt Commitment
Letter or not to provide the Debt Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the
Offer Conditions and the conditions in _Section 5.1_, as of the Agreement
Date, each of Parent and Merger Sub has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions in the Commitment Letters will fail to be satisfied on a timely
basis or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment Letters
will not be available to be funded at the Offer Acceptance Time or at the
Closing.

(d) Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, has fully paid (or caused to be paid)
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letters
to be paid on or before the Agreement Date. The aggregate proceeds from the
Financing (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue
discount and similar premiums and chargers and after giving effect of the
maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under
the Debt Commitment Letter) constitute all of the financing required for the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, and are
sufficient in amount for Parent to pay the Offer Price for all Shares tendered
in the Offer, the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be paid
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including
any amounts payable in respect of Company Options, Company RSUs and Company
MSUs under this Agreement) and, together with the Companys cash on hand as of
the Closing Date, all associated fees, costs and expenses in connection with
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including the Financing, in
each case, to the extent required to be paid on the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). The only conditions precedent
related to the obligations of Sponsor to fund the full amount of the Equity
Financing and the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Fee Letter, respectively.

 

(e) As of the Agreement Date, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement
or understanding (i) awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or
financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in
connection with the Transactions or (ii) expressly prohibiting any bank,
investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing
or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any
Person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions.

Section 3.6 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete
copy of the executed limited guarantee, dated as of the Agreement Date, from
Sponsor in favor of the Company in respect of certain matters on the terms
specified therein (the " _Limited Guarantee_ "). As of the Agreement Date,
the Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. The
Limited Guarantee, in the 

 



35  form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Sponsor, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as
enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles. As of
the Agreement Date, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Sponsor
under any term or condition of the Limited Guarantee.

 

Section 3.7 _Solvency_. Neither of Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 2
hereof, and after giving effect to the Transactions and the payment of the
aggregate Offer Price and Per Share Merger Consideration, and payment of the
Required Amount, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent immediately after
the payment of the Offer Price and as of the Effective Time and immediately
after the consummation of the applicable Transactions. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Solvent," when used with respect to any Person,
means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the fair value of the assets

Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless in each case:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three calendar days in advance (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "),
that the Company Board has resolved to effect such a Change of Board
Recommendation (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board
Recommendation) or terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal
absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons making such
Superior Proposal, and shall have contemporaneously provided the relevant
proposed definitive transaction agreements with the Person making such
Superior Proposal;

 

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and shall
have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in good
faith during the Superior Proposal Notice Period to make any _bona fide_
modifications proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Superior Proposal would cease to constitute a
"Superior Proposal" hereunder;

(iii) either (A) Parent shall not have, prior to the expiration of the
Superior Proposal Notice Period, made a written offer to modify the terms of
this Agreement that would, upon the Companys acceptance thereof, be binding
on Parent or (B) the Company Board (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of any irrevocable written offer by Parent to modify the
terms of this Agreement, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change to the
financial or other material terms of an Acquisition Proposal that was
previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to
Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices
references herein to a "three calendar day period" shall be deemed references
to a "one Business Day period"); and

 



46 (iv) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with _Section
6.1(e)_ , including paying the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
6.2(b)(i)_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board may effect a Change of Board Recommendation prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time if an Intervening Event occurs and the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that its failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board may not effect such Change
of Board Recommendation unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three (3) calendar days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_
"), of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which
notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which
notice shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon
which the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation;

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and
shall have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in
good faith during the Intervening Event Notice Period to make any _bona fide_
modifications proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation; and

(iii) either (A) Parent shall not have, prior to the expiration of the
Intervening Event Notice Period, made an irrevocable written offer to modify
the terms of this Agreement that would, upon the Companys acceptance thereof,
be binding on Parent or (B) the Company Board (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of any irrevocable written offer by Parent
to modify the terms of this Agreement, that the failure to make a Change of
Board Recommendation in connection therewith would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(h) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to modify
the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to be disclosed in any
Company SEC Documents.

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, Item 1012 of Regulation M-A or otherwise complying
with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Company

 



47  Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law, it being
understood that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) pursuant to this _sentence_ must be subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and that nothing in the foregoing will be
deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation other than in accordance with _Section
4.3(e)_. In addition, none of the following shall be deemed to be a Change of
Board Recommendation: (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an
express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal, (iii) an
express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation and/or (iv) a
factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt and
review of an Acquisition Proposal, the terms thereof and the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto.

(j) No Change of Board Recommendation shall change the approval of the
Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any
action that may be taken by the Company Board under this _Section 4.3_  may
also be taken by a duly constituted committee thereof.

Section 4.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any Consents of third parties with respect to any Contracts
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as may be necessary or appropriate
for the consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any
Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions to the extent
reasonably requested in writing by Parent, so as to maintain and preserve the
benefits to the Surviving Corporation of such Contract as of and following the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ that without its consent (such
consent to be given or withheld in its sole discretion), the Company shall not
be required to pay any amount or change Contract terms or its business
practices in order to obtain any such Consent.

(b) Subject to _Section 4.4(c)_ and the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent agree, and Parent and the Company each
agree to cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Transactions and to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the Offer Conditions and the conditions to each Partys obligation to
consummate the Transactions as set forth in _Section 5.1_ to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the Outside Date),
including using their reasonable best efforts (i) to obtain all Governmental
Consents required for the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, (ii) to
effect all such necessary registrations and filings with the Governmental
Authorities in order to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions, (iii) to comply with all requirements under
applicable Law which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger and (iv) to defend any Proceedings, whether judicial or

 



48  administrative, brought under, pursuant to or relating to any regulatory Law
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. The
Parties shall cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary in
connection with the foregoing.

(c) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 4.4(b)_ and without
limiting the generality of the undertaking pursuant thereto, Parent and
Company shall promptly make all filings that may be required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _paragraph (ii)_ of _Exhibit B
(Offer Conditions)_ by each of them in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions, which, in any event, shall be made within 10 Business Days
following the Agreement Date with respect to the initial filings required
under the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws. In addition,
Parent and the Company agree, and shall each cause each of its Subsidiaries,
to cooperate and to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
Governmental Consents required for the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger as contemplated by _Section 4.4(b)_ above as promptly as possible,
including to make all other necessary filings, notifications or registrations
within 15 Business Days of the Agreement Date to obtain all
Governmental Consents, to respond as promptly as practicable to any requests
for information from any Governmental Authority, and to contest and resist any
action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust
Order_ ") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust
Law. Each Party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by it to any Governmental
Authority. Neither Party shall Consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any Antitrust Law or other
regulatory Law unless the other Party has given its prior written Consent to
such extension or delay.

(d) Parent and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with Proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, the
Parties agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings
with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each
other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all substantive and material oral
communications with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws,
(iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates a substantive oral communication
regarding any Antitrust Laws, to promptly notify the other Party of the
substance of such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable
advance opportunity to review and comment upon all material written
communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental Authority regarding any
Antitrust Laws and (vi) provide each other with copies of all written
communications from any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust
Laws. Any disclosures or provision of copies by one Party to the other may be
made on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate. Except as prohibited or
restricted by applicable Law, each Party or its attorneys shall provide the
other Party or its attorneys the

 



49  opportunity to make copies of all correspondence, filings or communications
(or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between such Party or its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify and keep the other advised as
to (i) any material communication from any Governmental Authority regarding
any of the Transactions and (ii) any litigation or administrative Proceeding
pending and known to such Party, or to its knowledge threatened, that
challenges, or would challenge, the Transactions.

(f) If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or threatened by any Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as
violating any Antitrust Law or if a filing pursuant to _Section 4.4(b)_ is
reasonably likely to be rejected or conditioned by a Governmental Authority,
then each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections or challenges as such Governmental Authority or other Person may
have to such transactions so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as
soon as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate any concerns on the part of, or to satisfy any conditions imposed
by, any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law or any other Person so
as to enable the Parties to consummate the Transactions as promptly
as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including (i)
proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, committing to and effecting), by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, now owned or
hereafter sought to be acquired, (ii) terminating or amending any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, or (iii) otherwise offering to take or offering
to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking, and if the offer
is accepted, taking or committing to take, such actions as are necessary,
whether or not such actions limit or modify Parents rights of ownership in,
or ability to conduct the business of, one or more of its operations,
divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets, including, after
the Closing, the business of the Company, in each case as if it is determined
that such action is necessary in order to obtain all Governmental Consents
necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in _paragraph (ii)_ of _Exhibit B
(Offer Conditions)_ prior to the Outside Date and/or to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order which would have the
effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Offer and the Merger
and the other Transactions beyond the Outside Date. In connection therewith,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that (x) no requirement
for a Consent of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other Governmental
Authority, (y) no Order or Proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any
Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Offer and the Merger prior
to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event will Parent or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates be
obligated pursuant to this Agreement to, and the Company will not without the
written consent of Parent, sell, divest, license or hold separate any
capital stock or other Equity Interest, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, products or businesses, or to take or commit to take any
action, that would be reasonably expected to (1) materially adversely affect
the business of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole or (2) to

 



50  the extent such sale divestiture, license or disposition impacts any
Affiliate, materially adversely affect the business of the Affiliate and the
Affiliates Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each Party shall keep the other Party informed of all material matters,
discussions and activities relating to any of the matters contemplated by this
_Section 4.4(f)_.

 

(g) During the Pre-Closing Period, except as required by this Agreement,
Parent and its Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any
action to be taken or transaction to be entered into by Parent or any of its
Affiliates, that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of
Parent, its Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates shall, and shall not
cause any Person to, acquire (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or
asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any assets of or any
equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof, if that
acquisition or agreement would reasonably be expected to (i) materially
increase the risk of not obtaining any Governmental Consent required in
connection with the Transactions, (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions, or materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iii) prevent or materially delay
receipt of any Governmental Consent required in connection with the
Transactions.

 

(h) No action by the Company taken in compliance with _Section 4.3_ will be
considered a violation of this _Section 4.4_.

 

Section 4.5 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions described in the Commitment Letters
and the Debt Fee Letter (including the market flex provisions therein),
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly negotiate
definitive agreements on the terms (including any market flex provisions) and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any market flex provisions) so that such agreements are in effect
on the Closing Date, (ii) promptly satisfy (or obtain a waiver to) or cause
the satisfaction (or waiver) of all conditions in the Commitment Letters and
the definitive agreements for the Financing applicable to Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, and within Parents or Merger Subs control (the "
_Financing Agreements_ "), (iii) consummate the Financing on or prior to the
date on which the consummation of the Offer is required to occur, (iv) accept
(and comply with) to the fullest extent all "flex" provisions contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter and the Financing Agreements
to the extent such "flex" provisions are exercised in accordance with the
terms thereof, (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters, (vi)
comply with and maintain in effect the Commitment Letters and (vii) in the
event that the Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_
and the Commitment Letters have been satisfied or, upon funding would
be satisfied, cause the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing
and the Sponsor to fund the full amount of the Equity Financing at or prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time (or if less, the Required Amount). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, except as expressly provided in _Section
4.5(b)_ with respect to an alternative financing, in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or

 



51  Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to, and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to, (i) pay any fees in excess
of those contemplated by the Financing as of the date hereof (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, those fees contained in the market flex provisions
contained in the Debt Fee Letter) or (ii) agree to conditionality or economic
terms of the Financing that are less favorable (in the aggregate) to Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, than those contemplated by the Commitment
Letters and the Debt Fee Letter (including any market flex provisions therein)
as of the date hereof.

 

(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by
each of Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy its obligations under  _Section
4.5(a)_ , any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and subject only to the conditions (including any market flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (unless such portion is not
reasonably required to consummate the Transactions, and in any event other
than as the result of any financing that replaces or is substituted for, in
whole or in part, any portion of the Debt Financing pursuant to any
replacement or substitution Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the
requirements of _Section 4.5(c_ ), Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, alternative financing in an amount sufficient to pay, when added
to the Equity Financing, the Required Amount upon terms and conditions not
less favorable, taken as a whole, to Merger Sub and to the Company (with
respect to conditionality) than those in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Debt Fee Letter (including the market flex provisions therein) as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later
than the Closing Date; _provided_ that such alternative financing shall not
have any of the effects described in clauses (1) through (4) of clause (c)(i)
below. Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all
agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Merger Sub with any portion of the Debt Financing substantially
concurrently with the execution thereof (with any fee letters redacted in a
customary manner).

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall have the right from time to
time to amend, restate, amend and restate, replace, substitute, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letters,
the Debt Fee Letter and/or any definitive agreements relating to the
Financing; _provided_ that (i) without the prior written consent of the
Company, no such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver
shall (1) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount in respect
of the Debt Financing) to be funded on the Closing Date unless the Equity
Financing, Debt Financing, alternative financing permitted in accordance
herewith or cash on hand of Merger Sub is increased by a corresponding amount
(or Merger Sub may draw upon an available revolving credit facility to fund
an amount equal to such reduction; _provided_ that such draw would not and
would not reasonably be expected to impair any availability required to fund
the maximum amount of market flex that might be imposed), (2) add conditions
precedent to the Financing or amend, replace, supplement or modify any
existing conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the funding of the
Financing, (3) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, or, in the case of the Equity Commitment Letter and Limited
Guarantee, the Company to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights under
the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, or (4) impose obligations on the Company or its Affiliates prior to
the Closing Date; and (ii) it is understood

 



52  and agreed that Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, may amend the
Commitment Letters and the Debt Fee Letter to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the Agreement Date. Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that the certificate to be delivered by an authorized officer of the
Company under paragraph 6 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter
with respect to solvency of the Company may be delivered by an individual who
is an authorized officer of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Merger Sub obtains alternative
financing pursuant to _Section 4.5(b)_, or amends, restates, amends and
restates, replaces, substitutes, supplements, waives or otherwise modifies any
of the Financing pursuant to _Section 4.5(c)_, references to the "Financing",
the "Debt Financing", the "Commitment Letters", the "Debt Commitment Letter"
and the "Debt Fee Letter" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be
deemed to refer to such alternative financing, or the Financing as so
amended, restated, amended and restated, replaced, substituted, supplemented,
waived or otherwise modified.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a reasonably timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company, upon reasonable request, with copies of agreements
relating to the Financing and such other information and documentation
regarding such Financing as shall be reasonably necessary to allow the Company
to monitor the progress of such financing activities. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall notify the Company
promptly if at any time prior to the Closing Date: (i) the Commitment Letters
or Financing Agreements expire or are terminated for any reason, (ii) Parent
or Merger Sub obtains knowledge of any material breach or default by any
party to any Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default
thereunder), (iii) Parent or Merger Sub receives any written communication
from any Person providing a Commitment Letter with respect to any (1) actual,
potential or threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Commitment Letters with respect to a material provision of the
Commitment Letters or (2) a material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to the Commitment Letters with respect to the obligation to
fund the Financings or the amount of the Financings to be funded upon the
consummation of the Offer and at the Closing or (iv) if Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, for any reason, otherwise no longer believes in good faith that
it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
described in the Commitment Letters. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, a written request
therefor, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (i) through (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_
that they need not provide any information believed to be attorney-client
privileged.

(f) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to use reasonable best
efforts to, cooperate with Merger Sub in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Merger Sub, in each case
at Parents sole expense, including its reasonable best efforts to (i)
participate (and use reasonable best efforts to cause members of senior
management

 



53  of the Company to participate) in a reasonable number of meetings with
actual or prospective Lenders, rating agency sessions and sessions or
presentations with actual or prospective Lenders or investors, due diligence
sessions, road shows and drafting sessions, including direct contact between
senior management and the other representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the actual or prospective Lenders
or investors, on the other hand, in each case upon reasonable notice, (ii)
reasonably assist Merger Sub and the Lenders in the preparation of materials
for rating agency presentations and bank books, Lender and investor
presentations or other marketing documents necessary or proper for, or
customarily used to arrange, transactions similar to the Debt Financing by
companies of a comparable size in a comparable industry as the Company, and
identifying any portion of the information that constitutes (or would
constitute, if the Company were a public company) material, non-public
information, and reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of Merger Sub
and the Lenders for any portion of the Debt Financing, (iii) furnish Merger
Sub and the Lenders with the Required Financial Information and such other
pertinent financial and other customary information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Merger Sub or the Lenders
in connection with the Debt Financing (and of the type and form customarily
provided by companies of comparable size and comparable industry in
transactions similar to the Debt Financing) (including, without limitation,
any information reasonably necessary to prepare the pro forma financial
statements required by paragraph 7 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter
(or the analogous provision in any amendment, restatement, amendment and
restatement, replacement, substitution, supplement or other modification
thereof that is required or permitted hereunder), to the extent reasonably
available to the Company, (iv) facilitate the granting of a security interest
(and perfection thereof) in collateral in connection with the Debt Financing,
and the preparation, execution and delivery of guarantees, mortgages, other
definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents as may
reasonably be requested by Merger Sub, including obtaining releases of
existing Liens (to the extent required in the Debt Commitment Letter),
_provided_ that all of the foregoing, including any obligations and releases
of Liens contained in all such agreements and documents, shall be subject to
the occurrence of the Closing Date and become effective no earlier than the
Closing Date, (v) furnish (at least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date) Merger Sub and the Lenders with all documentation and other information
reasonably requested with respect to the Debt Financing under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations to the
extent requested in writing at least nine Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, (vi) providing a certificate of the chief financial officer or person
performing similar functions of the Company in the form attached to the Debt
Commitment Letter with respect to solvency matters and customary authorization
letters with respect to the bank information memoranda authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and
containing a customary representation to the Lenders that the public side
versions of such documents, if any, do not include material nonpublic
information about the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Company Securities,
(vii) assisting in the preparation, execution and delivery of one or more
credit agreements, pledge and security documents and other definitive
financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Merger Sub; _provided_
that the foregoing documentation shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing Date and become effective no earlier than the Closing Date, (viii)
ensure that the Lenders benefit from existing lending relationships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ix) obtain accountants comfort letters and
consent letters, insurance certificates and endorsements at the expense of and
as reasonably requested by Merger Sub on behalf of the Lenders, and (x)
cooperate in satisfying 

 



54  the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document relating to the Debt Financing to the extent satisfaction
thereof requires the cooperation, or is within the control, of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective representatives; _provided_ that (w) any
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contained in any
materials in connection with the Debt Financing shall be subject to the prior
review of the Company, (x) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
directors, officers or employees shall be required to pledge any assets as
collateral, execute any definitive agreement in respect of the Debt Financing
or any closing certificate or other agreement, or pay any commitment or other
similar fee, incur any other Liability or Indebtedness in connection with the
Debt Financing (other than with respect to customary authorization letters
with respect to bank information memoranda), in each case that will be
effective prior to the Closing Date, (y) directors and officers of the Company
or any Subsidiary shall only be required to adopt resolutions or take other
action approving or executing the agreements, documents or instruments
pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained in their capacity as
directors or officers of the Company or any Subsidiary immediately following
the Effective Time and in no event shall such resolutions, approvals or
executions be effective prior to the Closing Date, and (z) such cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Merger Sub shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses related to the Financing and shall promptly reimburse upon
request of the Company, reasonable and documented all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company
as contemplated by this _Section 4.5_. Parent shall, and hereby agrees to,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives from and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, except to the
extent arising from (i) historical information furnished in writing by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including financial statements,
or (ii) the willful misconduct, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Nothing hereunder will require any officer or
Company Representative to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
other action that becomes effective prior to the Closing Date or that would
result in personal liability to such officer or representative (other than
with respect to customary authorization letters with respect to bank
information memoranda). All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or the Company Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the Debt
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so
long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as
if parties thereto or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a
beneficiary. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained
in this _Section 4.5_ represent the sole obligation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing.

(g) In no event will the Sponsor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to include each
direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the financing sources or potential
financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and such investors) enter into any
Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or

 



55  financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis or (ii)
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other
potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide

Section 4.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with
each other and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or public announcement relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, issue any
such press release or public announcement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested
by a Governmental Authority, as determined in good faith by the Party making
such public announcement or issuing such press release, in which case, such
Party shall use commercially reasonably efforts to consult with the other
Party prior to any such public announcement. The Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agree that the initial press release announcing the Transactions and the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release in the
form heretofore agreed to by the Company and Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.6_ , (i) each of the Parties and
their Affiliates may issue press releases or public announcements concerning
the Transactions that are not inconsistent in any material respect with
previous press releases or public announcements made by Parent or the Company
in compliance with this _Section 4.6_ , (ii) each of the Parties, their
Affiliates, the Company Representatives and the Parent Representatives may
make public statements in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent
in any material respect with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this
_Section 4.6_ and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the
other parties, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions and (iii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 4.6_ shall not apply to any press
release or public announcement issued or proposed to be issued in connection
with, or in response to, a Change of Board Recommendation that complies with
_Section 4.3_.

 

Section 4.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is reflected in the books and records
of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and level of
benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and
severance) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees will be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the extent
that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of benefits. To
the extent any Company Employee participates in a New Plan that is a health
and/or welfare plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any
insurer or service provider under the applicable

 



56  Parent Welfare Plan, cause all (i) pre-existing condition limitations which
otherwise would be applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents to be waived to the extent satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan
comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employees commencement of
participation in such Parent Welfare Plan, (ii) participation waiting periods
under each Parent Welfare Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such
Company Employee to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Company Employees
commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare Plan and (iii) co-
payments and deductibles paid by Company Employees in the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs to be credited for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out of pocket requirement under any such Parent
Welfare Plan. In addition, to the extent that any Company Employee has begun a
course of treatment with a physician or other service provider who is
considered "in network" under a Company Benefit Plan and such course of
treatment is not completed prior to the Closing, Parent will use reasonable
efforts to arrange for transition care, whereby such Company Employee may
complete the applicable course of treatment with the pre-Closing physician or
other service provider at "in network" rates.

 

(b) For any Company Employee that remains an employee of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(each a " _Continuing Employee_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, for a period ending on the earlier of (x) the date
that is 12 months following the Effective Time and (y) December 31,
2017, provide for (i) at least the same level of base salary or base hourly
wage levels, if applicable, that were provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash incentive compensation
opportunities that are at least equal (including with respect to individual
target bonus levels) to that provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee benefits (other than equity-based
awards, defined benefit, or non-qualified arrangements) that are
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than
equity-based awards, defined benefit, or non-qualified arrangements) provided
to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, or
otherwise as required by applicable Law and (iv) and upon a termination
without cause of a Continuing Employee, severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those that would have been provided to each such Continuing
Employee under the applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company
shall pay bonuses for the Companys fiscal year ending July 31, 2016 pursuant
to the applicable Company Employee Plan at the actual levels. Parent shall
cause each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who participate
in the 2017 annual bonus or incentive plan as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date to be paid a bonus in respect of the fiscal year ending July 31,
2017 in accordance with the terms of the plan as in effect on the Closing
Date.

(c) For any Company Employee that is not a Continuing Employee (each a "
_Non-Continuing Employee_ "), Parent shall provide such Non-Continuing
Employee with the severance payments and termination payments or benefits
under the applicable formula set forth, or otherwise described, in _Section
4.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or any higher amount of severance
and/or termination payments or benefits as may be required by applicable Law,
any agreement between such Company Employee and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any

 



57  agreement governing the relationship between such Company Employee and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (such payments and benefits, the "
_Transaction Severance Benefits_ "). Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, Parent will pay or deliver the Transaction Severance Benefits
to any such Non-Continuing Employee as soon as reasonably practicable
following the termination of such Non -Continuing Employees employment. In
addition to the foregoing, The Company and Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts and take any action reasonably necessary to
mitigate and/or minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of
the Code (including as a result of the Transactions under all employment,
severance and termination agreements, other compensation arrangements and
Company Benefit Plans) on any individual that is regarded as a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1); _provided_ , that the foregoing shall in no event require or be
deemed to require Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to, or permit the
Company to, provide any "gross ups".

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to
effect such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k)
Plan_ ") and any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including amending and/or
terminating the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan and
applicable Law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate
participation of the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan or other
replacement plan.

 

(e) Any "Offering Period" (as defined in the Company ESPP) in progress under
the Company ESPP shall continue, and, except as otherwise provided in this
(e), the Shares shall be issued to participants therein on the next currently
scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after the Agreement Date as
provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Company ESPP;
_provided_ , from and after the date hereof, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to (i) not commence a new Offering Period and (ii) ensure
that no new participants be permitted into the Company ESPP and that the
existing participants thereunder may not increase their elections with
respect to the current Offering Period. In the event that any Offering Period
under the Company ESPP has not ended on the date immediately preceding the
Effective Time, then such Offering Period shall be terminated as of second
Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time and all participant
contributions then in the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase Shares on
such date in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as if such date
was the last date of such Offering Period. Notwithstanding any restrictions on
transfer of stock in the Company ESPP, all Shares purchased under the Company
ESPP shall be treated identically to all other Shares in the Merger and
the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor in accordance with
_Section 1.7_. The Company shall terminate the Company ESPP as of or
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) This _Section 4.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 4.7_ ,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 4.7_.
Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any
particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 4.7_ or (iii) require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular Company Employee.

 



58 (g) Following the Agreement Date, each of Parent and the Company (and their
respective Affiliates) will use reasonable best efforts in all matters
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 4.7_ and
the requirements of any applicable Law and will provide, and will cause each
of their respective representatives, including legal, human resources and
regulatory compliance personnel, to provide, all cooperation reasonably
requested by the other Party in that regard, including (i) cooperating and
providing each other with all necessary and reasonable assistance and
information to ensure that any works councils or committees, trade unions
and/or employee representatives applicable to the Continuing Employees are
provided with the information required in order for proper
consultation, notification and other required processes under applicable Law
to take place, and (ii) exchanging information and data, including reports
prepared in connection with bonus plan participation and related data of
Continuing Employees (other than individual bonus opportunities based on
target bonus as a percentage of base salary), relating to workers
compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages, including
information and data that are necessary to support or perform any
compensation consultant process or that is otherwise reasonably requested in
connection with any compensation consultant process (in each case, except to
the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to the extent that such information
and data relates to performance ratings or assessments of employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), making any and all required filings and
notices, making any and all required communications with Company Employees and
obtaining any Governmental Authorizations required hereunder. Such
cooperation will include the provision of any information and consultation
required by applicable Law, the terms of any Contract, or as reasonably
requested by the other Party. Each of Parent and the Company will make
available its representatives at such times and in such places as the other
Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with representatives
of any such works council, economic committee, union or similar body.

 

Section 4.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) At and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall,
jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
respective present or former directors and officers (each an " _Indemnified
Person_ ," and collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all costs
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection
with any pending or threatened Proceeding (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, to the extent that such action or omission
occurred on or before the Effective Time, or relating to this Agreement and
the Transactions. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parent and the
Surviving Company shall, jointly and severally, pay all expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) of each Indemnified Person in advance of
the final disposition of any such Proceeding, subject to receipt from the
Indemnified Person to whom such expenses are advanced of an undertaking, to
the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined in accordance with applicable Law that such

 



59  Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any
such Proceeding, (i) Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly
after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any pending or threatened Proceeding to which an Indemnified Person is a
party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Person hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from
all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Person
otherwise consents or relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving
Corporation is entirely responsible, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving
Company shall (x) reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the
defense of any such matter and (y) without limitation to any rights of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to any Indemnification Contract, have the right to
control the defense of any such matter (it being understood that, by electing
to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Cooperation will be deemed to
have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto). The rights of each
Indemnified Person under this _Section 4.8_ shall be in addition to any
rights such Person may have under the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws,
and indemnification agreements in existence on the Agreement Date and the
comparable documents of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnification Agreements_").

 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the Agreement Date by the Company pursuant to
applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws and the
applicable DandO Indemnification Agreements, arising out of acts or omissions
in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of
directors, officers and, to the extent applicable under Indemnification
Contracts (Section 6.5) of the Company Bylaws, employees of the Company for
periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the DandO Indemnification Agreements shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall bind and purchase
directors and officers runoff insurance coverage (the " _D andO Runoff
Insurance_"), which by its terms shall survive the Merger for not less than
six years for the benefit of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Companys and
any of its Subsidiarys past and present directors and/or officers that are
insured under the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policy in effect as of the Agreement Date with a cost not to exceed
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior
to the Agreement Date (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). The DandO Runoff Insurance
shall provide coverage for the Company, its Subsidiaries and such persons in
their capacity as directors, officers and/or employees of the Company or any
of its

 



60  Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time that is not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing directors and officers policy (true and
complete copies which have been made available to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the DandO Runoff Insurance in
full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a
period of six years after the Effective Time or, if such policies are
terminated or cancelled, obtain (subject to the limitations set forth in the
next sentence) alternative DandO Runoff Insurance on substantially similar terms
as set forth in this _Section 4.8(d)_. Neither the Company nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay in excess of the Maximum Amount for the
DandO Runoff Insurance (it being understood and agreed that in the event the
cost of such DandO Runoff Insurance exceeds the Maximum Amount, in the
aggregate, the Company shall remain obligated to provide, and the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, the broadest DandO Runoff Insurance
coverage as may be obtained for the Maximum Amount). The Company and
Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application and provide
reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable
insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such DandO Runoff Insurance.
Parent shall upon written request furnish a copy of such insurance policy to
each beneficiary of such policy.

 

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and are not the continuing or surviving company or Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of their
properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision shall be made so
that such continuing or surviving corporation or Entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 4.8_.

 

(f) The obligations under this _Section 4.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any
indemnitee to whom this _Section 4.8_ applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this _Section 4.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 4.8_).

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to,
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification
agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 4.8_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

Section 4.9 _State Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to
be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger, including by
reason of the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto or any other transaction
contemplated to be consummated by the Parties pursuant to this Agreement, then
the Company Board shall take all action necessary to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 4.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the 

 



61  Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder of Company Common
Stock Company Options and Company Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of
any Company RSUs or Company MSUs, pursuant to this Agreement, and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

Section 4.11 _Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall not conduct any business or make any investments or incur or guarantee
any Indebtedness other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any Proceeding brought by the Company Stockholders or other Persons
against the Company or any of its directors, officers or the Company
Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to
the status, strategy and other significant decisions thereof with respect to
any such Proceeding (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between
the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected). Without
limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by the Company in
connection with any such Proceeding, and the right to consult on any
settlement, defense, or prosecution with respect to such Proceeding, and the
Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and, no such
settlement, compromise, arrangement, or agreement to settle, compromise or
come to an arrangement regarding any such Proceeding shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 4.13 _Delisting; De-registration_. After the consummation of the
Offer, each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with each other to do or cause
to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under applicable Law and the rules and policies of NYSE to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from NYSE
and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

Section 4.14 _Parent Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, will adopt this Agreement by written consent in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 4.15 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise,
consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over their own business and operations.

 



62 Section 4.16 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. At a meeting duly called and held at which
all members of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") were present, the Compensation Committee (i) duly
and unanimously adopted resolutions approving as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (A) each
Company Stock Plan, (B) the treatment of Company Options, Company RSUs and
Company MSUs in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the

under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 4.17 _Notification of Certain Events_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VI and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt
notice to Parent upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made
by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Offer or Merger to fail to be satisfied at the Offer Closing or
the Closing, respectively, except that no such notification will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Offer or the Merger or the remedies available to the
Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that the failure to notify
Parent of a breach of any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.17(a)_ shall not constitute a breach
of covenant in any material respect for purposes of _paragraph (v)_ of
_Exhibit B_.

(b) At all times during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VI and the Effective Time, Parent will give prompt notice
to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made
by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if
and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
the Company to consummate the Offer or Merger to fail to be satisfied at the
Offer Closing or Closing, respectively, except that no such notification will
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations
of the Company to consummate the Offer or the Merger or the remedies available

_Section 6.1(f)_ if any of the circumstances referred to in clauses (i) or
(iii) of this _Section 6.1(f)_ was primarily caused by the breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub;

(g) By the Company, if: (i) there shall be an inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or breach of
any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, in any case,
that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice of such
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or breach of covenant, and (iii)
either such inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or breach of covenant
is not capable of cure or at least 30 days shall have elapsed since the date
of delivery of such written notice to Parent and such inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty or breach of covenant shall not have been cured;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(g)_ if any of the circumstances
referred to in clauses (i) or (iii) of this _Section 6.1(g)_ was primarily
caused by the breach of this Agreement by the Company; or

 

(h) By the Company:

(i) if Merger Sub fails to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) the Offer within one Business Day after it is otherwise
obligated to commence the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)_; _provided_ that
the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(h)(i)_ if the Company shall have

 



65  breached or failed to perform any of its covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform is the primary cause of, or
resulted in, Merger Sub not commencing the Offer in a timely manner; or

(ii) if (A) all of the Offer Conditions have been and continue to be satisfied
or waived (other than the Financing Proceeds Condition and those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time but which
conditions would be capable of being satisfied if the Expiration Time were the
time of such termination), (B) the Company has confirmed by written notice
its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
6.1(h)(ii)_ if Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Offer Closing when
required in accordance with  _Section 1.1(b)_, (C) Parent has failed to
consummate the Offer within three Business Days of the date the Offer Closing
should have occurred in accordance with _Section 1.1(b)_ and (D) the Company
stood ready, willing, and able to consummate the Offer Closing and the
Closing on the date following such three Business Days and the Company shall
have given Parent a written notice on or prior to such date confirming such
fact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining when the
Offer Closing should have occurred pursuant to clause (C) above, the Parties
agree that only three consecutive extensions of five Business Days each
pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)(ii) need be taken into account_.

Section 6.2 _Effect of Termination; Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event of valid termination of this Agreement by either the Company
or Parent as provided in _Section 6.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and of no further force or effect and there shall be no Liability
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, any Lender Related Party or the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
agents, equityholders or representatives, or any other Company Related
Parties or Parent Related Parties, except with respect to _Section 3.14_
(Independent Investigation), _Section 4.2(b)_ (Confidentiality), _Section
4.6_ (Public Announcements), this _Section 6.2_ and _Article VII_ (and all
the defined terms appearing in such sections) shall survive termination and
remain in full force and effect and (ii) subject to the limitations in this 
_Section 6.2_, the valid termination of this Agreement will not relieve any
Person from any Liabilities incurred or suffered by a Party as a result of an
Intentional Breach by another Party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.
Nothing shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or
remedies it may have under _Section 7.7_ in lieu of terminating this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 6.2_.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)_ or by the Company pursuant to  _Section 6.1(e)_, then the Company
shall pay to Parent concurrently with such termination, in the case of a
termination by the Company, or within two Business Days thereafter, in the
case of a termination by Parent, a termination fee of $42,862,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that if this Agreement is validly terminated
by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_ after the Agreement Date and
prior to the Excluded Party Deadline in a circumstance in which the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the right of termination is with an Excluded Party,
then such Termination Fee shall be $19,483,000.

 



66 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by (x) Parent or
Company pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_, _if_ (1) at the final Expiration Date
immediately preceding such termination all Offer Conditions other than the
Minimum Tender Condition had been satisfied (other than those Offer Conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but which
conditions would be capable of being satisfied if the Expiration Time were the
time of such termination), (2) at the time of such termination the Commitment
Letter shall not have been terminated, withdrawn or rescinded and (3) in the
case of termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would not be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_, or
(y) Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(f)_ as a result of an Intentional Breach
by the Company, and (ii) (A) following the Agreement Date and prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or
shall have otherwise become publicly known (and not publicly withdrawn or
abandoned prior to the time of such termination) and (B) within 12 months
after such termination, the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or
enters into an Alternate Acquisition Agreement (in each case, whether or not
the Acquisition Proposal referenced in the preceding clause) and such
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated ( _provided_ that for all
purposes of this _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_, the term Acquisition Proposal shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Exhibit A_ , except that the
references to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to 50 %), then the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee on the date no later than two
Business Days after, and subject to, the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal.

(iii) All payments under this  _Section 6.2(b)_ shall be made by the Company
to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent. In no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) In the event that the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 6.1(g)_ as a result of an Intentional Breach by Parent or Merger
Sub or _Section 6.1(h)(ii)_ or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 6.1(b)_ at such time the Company could have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 6.1(g)_ as a result of an Intentional Breach
by Parent or Merger Sub or _Section 6.1(h)(ii)_, then Parent shall pay the
Company a fee equal to $101,310,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within two Business Days after
such termination to an account designated in writing by the Company.

 

All payments under this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall be made by Parent to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company. In no event shall Parent be required to
pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 6.2_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. In the event this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(f)_ as a result of an
Intentional Breach by the Company, then the Company shall reimburse Parent for
its actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to exceed
$5,000,000 (the _"Expense Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the second business day following the date of such
termination of this Agreement; provided, that the existence of

 



67  circumstances which could require the Termination Fee (less any Expense
Reimbursement previously paid to Parent by the Company) to become subsequently
payable by the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to
pay the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this _Section_ ; and provided,
further, that the payment by the Company of the Expense Reimbursement pursuant
to this _Section 6.2(d)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee (less any Expense Reimbursement
previously paid to Parent by the Company).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) subject in
all respect to Parents rights to injunction, and specific performance set
forth in _Section 7.7_, in the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article VI_ and the Termination Fee is payable
pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ and is paid to Parent (or its designee) in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, payment of the Termination
Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub, and each
of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, against the Company and each
of its Affiliates, and each of their respective former, current and future
directors, officers, employees, holder of any equity, stockholders,
controlling Persons, Affiliates, attorneys, members, managers, general or
limited partners, assignees, agents or representatives (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any liability, loss or damage based upon,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution,
performance or any actual or purported breach hereof or the Transactions or
in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (ii) subject in all respect to the
Companys rights to injunction, and specific performance set forth in _Section
7.7_, in the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with Article VI and the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section
6.2(c)_ and is paid to the Company (or its designee) in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates and the other
Company Related Parties, as applicable, against Parent, Merger Sub, any Lender
Related Party and each of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, controlling Persons, agents or representatives
(collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any liability, loss or
damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the negotiation, execution, performance or any actual or purported breach
hereof or the Transactions or in respect of any other document or theory of
law or equity or in respect of any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. While each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with  _Section 7.7_ and the payment of
the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, under
_Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.2(c)_, respectively, under no circumstances
shall the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the
Closing and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Termination
Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall be entitled to specific performance under _Section 7.7_ if this
Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with Article VI and in no
event shall Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the
Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , and, for further clarity, in any
circumstance where performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement would relieve the

 



68  Company of its obligation to pay the Termination Fee, Parent may, in its
sole discretion: (i) seek specific performance pursuant to _Section 7.7_,
(ii) withdraw any claim for specific performance and require payment of the
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Termination Fee under _Section
6.2_ or (iii) if Parent is unable for any reason to obtain specific
performance, require payment of the Termination Fee if entitled to payment of
the Termination Fee under _Section 6.2_. The Company shall not be entitled to
specific performance under _Section 7.7_ if this Agreement has been validly
terminated in accordance with Article VI and in no event shall the Company or
its Affiliates be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and the Parent Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , and, for
further clarity, in any circumstance where performance by Parent and/or
Merger Sub of their obligations under this Agreement would relieve Parent of
its obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee, the Company may, in its sole
discretion: (i) seek specific performance pursuant to  _Section 7.7_, (ii)
withdraw any claim for specific performance and require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee under
_Section 6.2_, or (iii) if the Company is unable for any reason to obtain
specific performance, require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if
entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 6.2_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall (i) any Parent Related Party have any liability for monetary damages to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or any other Company Related Party (whether at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions, other than Sponsors obligations under the
Limited Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub as provided herein, or (ii) any former,
current or future general or limited partners, equity holders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates or agents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries have any liability to Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub
or any Parent Related Party for monetary damages (whether at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. In no event shall the Company seek or obtain, nor shall it
permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor shall any Person be
entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against
any Parent Related Party with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including, any breach by Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub),
the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Transactions
or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure, other than from Parent or Merger Sub to the
extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or Sponsor to the extent
expressly provided for in the Limited Guarantee or the Equity Commitment
Letter.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall the Company Related Parties be entitled to monetary recovery, award or
fees in excess of the amount of $101,310,000 in the aggregate (the " _Parent
Liability Limitation_ ") for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Limited Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including, any breach by Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub),
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the failure to
consummate the Transactions or any claims or actions under applicable
Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. In no event shall
the Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor shall they permit any of the
Company Representatives or any other Person on their behalf to seek or obtain,
nor shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery,
award

 



69  or fees in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent
Related Parties, and in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary recovery, award or fees of any
kind in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related

applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. In no
event shall the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor shall they permit

or obtain, nor shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any

Limitation against the Company Related Parties, and in no event shall Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary

Section 6.3 _Offer Conditions; Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company, on
the one hand, nor Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may rely, either
as a basis for not consummating the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Offer, the
Merger or the other Transactions on the failure of any of the Offer Conditions
or the conditions in _Section 5.1_ to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such Partys breach of this Agreement.

_Article VII._

Section 7.4 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree
that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree to negotiate in
good faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term.

 

Section 7.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Company
Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended
to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

Section 7.6 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not
be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, shall be null and
void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each Party and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns,
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except (a) as set forth in 
_Section 4.8_ (Indemnification of Directors and Officers), (b) from and after
the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Shares, the Company

 



72  RSUs, the Company MSUs and the Company Options to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration set forth in Article II, (c) this _Section 7.6_ in
respect of the foregoing clauses (b) and (d) the Lender Related Parties shall
be express third-party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely on
_Section 6.2(e)(ii)_, this _Section 7.6_, _Section 7.7(c)_. the proviso
of  _Section 7.8_, the last sentence of _Section 7.9_, _Section 7.10_ and
the last sentence of _Section 7.12_.

 

Section 7.7 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damage. It
is accordingly agreed that prior to any valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 6.1_ and subject in all respects to this
_Section 7.7_, (i) each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, and (ii) the
Parties shall waive, in any Proceeding for specific performance, the defense
of adequacy of a remedy at Law. The right to specific enforcement hereunder
shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each Party
further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section 7.7_,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The
Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand and (B) the specific
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants,
obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, on the basis that (x) either Party has an adequate
remedy at Law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at equity or Law, or any similar grounds.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
while a Partys pursuit of specific performance at any time shall not be
deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, under no circumstances
shall the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to
receive (1) both a grant of specific performance that results in the Closing
to occur, on the one hand, and the payment of any monetary damages whatsoever,
on the other hand or (2) both the payment of any monetary damages whatsoever,
on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any
amount, if any, as and when due pursuant to the terms hereof, on the other
hand.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of
the Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Offer Price and the Per Share Merger
Consideration and Parents and Merger Subs obligations to cause the Offer
Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the Offer Closing and the Closing (but
not the right of the Company to obtain such injunctions, specific performance
or other equitable

 



73  remedies for any other reason) shall be subject to the requirements that (i)
the Marketing Period has ended, (ii) all Offer Conditions or conditions set
forth in  _Section 5.1_, as applicable, were satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time or
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or
waived at the Expiration Time or the Closing, (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing or alternative funding and the Equity Financing
were funded, then, then it will take such actions that are required of it by
this Agreement to cause the Offer Closing or the Closing, as applicable, to
occur and (B) the Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the Offer
Closing and the Closing, and (iv) the Debt Financing (or alternative
financing) has been funded, or will be funded at the Offer Closing (if the
Equity Financing is funded), or the Lenders have irrevocably confirmed to
Parent in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded and available at the
Offer Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded).

(c) Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment
Letter and the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Company acknowledges and agrees that no Lender Related Party shall
have any Liability or obligation to the Company (or any of the
Company Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or any
Transactions if such Lender Related Party breaches or fails to perform
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of its
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Company (on behalf of
itself and the Company Representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims
against each Lender Related Party in connection with this Agreement and the
Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Representatives) agrees
not to commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate)
any action or proceeding against any Lender Related Party in connection with
this Agreement or any Transaction (including any action or proceeding
relating to the Debt Financing). In no event shall the Company (or any of the
Company Representatives) be entitled to directly seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against any Lender Related Party.

Section 7.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of this
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver
