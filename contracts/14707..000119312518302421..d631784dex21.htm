purposes in accordance with such allocations, (ii) file all forms required

Agreement, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Documents such amounts as it is required to deduct and

\- 23 -

Section 1446(f) of the Code. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Closing Date Statement_ _"_ ) setting forth the following: (i) a balance sheet
of the Vionic Entities as of the Closing (the _"_ _Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ _"_ ); (ii) the Closing Cash; (iii) the Closing Indebtedness;
(iv) the Closing Seller Transaction Expenses; (v) the Buyers resulting
calculation of the Purchase Price, and (vi) the Closing Working Capital
derived from the Closing Date Balance Sheet, prepared in accordance with the
Closing Working Capital Determination Standard, provided, however, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that such Closing Working
Capital determination shall not result in an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. The Buyer shall provide Sellers Representative and Sellers
Representatives accountants reasonable access at reasonable times to the
personnel, books and records of the Vionic Entities for the purpose of
Sellers Representatives review of such Final Closing Date Statement.

(b) The Final Closing Date Statement shall become final and binding upon the
Parties on the sixtieth (60th) day following Sellers Representatives receipt
of the Final Closing Date Statement, unless, prior to such date,
Sellers Representative gives written notice of its disagreement with respect
thereto, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the reasons for each item in
dispute with the Final Closing Date Statement (a _"_ _Notice of Disagreement_
_"_ ). If a Notice of Disagreement is received by the Buyer in a timely
manner, then the Final Closing Date Statement (as revised in accordance with
this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyer
on the earlier of (i) the date Sellers Representative and the Buyer resolve
in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm (as defined below). During the
thirty (30) day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement,
Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in
writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters

 



\- 27 -

    

 specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such thirty (30)
day period an agreement has not been reached, Sellers Representative and the
Buyer shall submit to a nationally recognized independent public accounting
firm agreed to by Sellers Representative and the Buyer in writing (the _"_
_Accounting Firm_ _"_ ) for determination of any and all matters that remain
in dispute and were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The
Accounting Firm shall determine only those issues set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement (and those raised by the Buyer in response thereto) that remain
in dispute and shall determine a value for any such disputed item which is
equal to or between the final values proposed by the Buyer and Sellers
Representative in their respective submissions). The Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall request that the Accounting Firm make a
decision with respect to all disputed items within thirty (30) days after
their submissions, as provided above and in any event as promptly as
practicable. Each of the Buyer and Sellers Representative (or their
respective designees) shall be permitted to submit a proposed Final Closing
Date Statement and applicable supporting documentation and to make a
presentation to the Accounting Firm in connection with the resolution of any
such disagreements, and, without the mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers
Representative, the Accounting Firm shall not rely on or consider any other
documents, materials, presentations or evidence (other than the
plain language of the Agreement) in making its determination. The final
determination with respect to all dispute items shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) and the Buyer and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all
parties hereto. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which
such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ shall be borne by the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, in accordance with
their respective Seller Allocation Percentage, in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted. The fees and disbursements of Sellers Representatives independent
auditors and attorneys incurred in connection with their review of the Final
Closing Date Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by
the Sellers in accordance with their respective Seller Allocation Percentage,
and the fees and disbursements of the Buyers independent auditors and
attorneys incurred in connection with their review of the Final Closing Date
Statement and any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by the Buyer. The
Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, each as set forth on the Final Closing
Date Statement that is final and binding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.03(b)_ are referred to as the _"_ _Final Closing Working Capital_ _,_ _"_ "
_Final Closing Cash_ ," the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ," and the "
_Final Seller Transaction Expenses_ ," respectively and the Purchase Price
calculated on the basis thereof (as calculated pursuant to Section 2.03(a)) is
referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_ ," provided, however, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that the Final Closing Working
Capital determination shall not result in an adjustment to the Final Purchase
Price.

 

(c) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Closing Purchase
Price, the Buyer shall pay the amount of such excess to Sellers
Representative, for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with their
respective Seller Allocation Percentage, no later than five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Purchase Price by wire transfer
of immediately available funds as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.06_. If the
Final Purchase Price

 



\- 28 -

    

 is less than the Estimated Closing Purchase Price, Sellers Representative
and Buyer shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Buyer from the Adjustment
Escrow Account such difference no later than five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.06_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, except as provided for in _Section_ __ _
2.06_, in no event shall the Sellers have any liability for any amounts
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ except to the extent of the funds
available in the Adjustment Escrow Account. If (i) the Buyer fails to pay any
amount owing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ or (ii) the Escrow
Agent fails to pay any amount owing pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
3.03(c)_ within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price, then the amount so owing shall be payable on demand and
interest shall accrue on the unpaid amount from the date due until paid at a
rate equal to the lower of (A) ten percent (10%) per annum or (B) the highest
rate permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(d) The calculation of the Closing Working Capital shall be prepared in
accordance with the Closing Working Capital Determination Standard.
The preparation and examination of the Final Closing Date Statement is not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation
methodology other than those provided for in the Closing Working Capital
Determination Standard. The Final Closing Date Statement and the calculation
of the Closing Working Capital therein shall not include any purchase
accounting or other adjustments arising out of the consummation of the
Transactions.

Section 8.02 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date which
is 12 months from the Closing (or if earlier, with respect to any Continuing
Company Employee, the date of such Continuing Company Employees termination
of employment with a Vionic Entity), Buyer shall and shall cause the
applicable Vionic Entity to provide each Company Employee who remains employed
by a Vionic Entity immediately after the Closing (each a _"_ _Continuing
Company Employee_ _"_ ) with: (i) base salary or hourly wages which are no
less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the applicable Vionic
Entity as of the date hereof; (ii) target bonus opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation), if any, which are no less than the target bonus
opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) provided by
the applicable Vionic Entity as of the date hereof and described on _Schedule
8.02(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules; (iii) retirement and welfare
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by
the applicable Vionic Entity immediately prior to the date hereof; and (iv)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the practice, plan or
policy in effect for such Continuing Company Employee as of the date hereof
and described on _Schedule 8.02(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by the Buyer or any Vionic Entity and in which any of
the Continuing Company Employees become eligible to participate (the _"_
_Buyer Plans_ _"_ ), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate
and vesting (but not benefit accrual under any pension plan), service with
the Vionic Entities (or predecessor employers to the extent that the Vionic
Entities provide past service credit) shall be treated as service with the
Buyer and/or any of its applicable Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods to the extent permitted by any
applicable insurance provider. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of the applicable Buyer Plans to (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to employees
under the Buyer Plans, except to the extent that such limitations or
waiting periods were applicable to such employee under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan, and (ii) give employees and their eligible dependents credit
under the Buyer Plans for amounts paid during the year in which the Closing
occurs under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying
any applicable deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Buyer Plans. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_ shall apply only to the extent
permitted under the Buyer Plans.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_, the Buyer
agrees to keep the current employee bonus plans maintained by the Vionic
Entities as described on _Schedule 8.02(c)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule
in place on each plans current terms and without amendments to such plans
until all amounts owing to the Company Employees under such plans for the
current plan year have been paid in full.

(d) In connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer will offer
continuation coverage as required by COBRA to those individuals, if any, who
are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as that term is defined in Section
54.4980B-9, Q-4 of the Treasury Regulations).

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify, or prevent the amendment, modification or termination of, any
Buyer Plan. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ shall not create any right in any Company Employee
or any other Person to any continued employment with the Vionic Entities or
any compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

Section 8.03 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For six (6) years following the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from

existing in favor of each present and former director, officer, manager or
managing member of the Vionic Entities and each such Person who served at the
request of the Vionic Entities as a director, officer, manager, trustee,
partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other Company Benefit Plan or enterprise
(collectively, the  _"_ _Company Indemnified Parties_ _"_ ) as provided in
each Vionic Entitys Organizational Documents, in each case, as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, shall be complied with and honored by
the applicable Vionic Entity, without further action, upon the Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms; and the Buyer will cause such Vionic Entity to comply with and honor
the foregoing obligations. 

(b) For six (6) years following the Closing Date, the Buyer and each Vionic
Entity shall cause the limited liability company agreement and any other
Organizational Documents of such Vionic Entity to contain provisions with
respect to exculpation, indemnification and expense reimbursement that are at
least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in
the limited liability company agreement or the other Organizational Documents
of such Vionic Entity as in effect on the date hereof.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause the Vionic Entities to
purchase a prepaid insurance policy (i.e., "tail coverage") (the _"_ _D andO
Tail Policy_ _"_ ) which provides liability insurance coverage for the Company
Indemnified Parties on no less favorable terms (including in amount and scope)
as the policy or policies maintained by the Vionic Entities immediately prior
to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals for an aggregate period of
not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising from acts, events
or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect
to the Transactions. The DandO Tail Policy shall be from an insurance carrier
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and with the same or better credit rating as
the insurance carrier of the Vionic Entities with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance. The fees and expenses of the DandO Tail Policy
shall be borne 50% by the Sellers (in accordance with their respective Seller
Allocation Percentage) and 50% by the Buyer.

(d) In the event that (i) any Vionic Entity or any of its successors or
assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person or (ii) the Buyer dissolves or causes the dissolution of any Vionic
Entity, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of such Vionic Entity assume and honor the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
8.03_.

(e) Each Company Indemnified Party shall have rights as a Third
Party beneficiary under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ as separate contractual
rights for his or her benefit, in addition to and not in substitution of any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Company
Indemnified Party may have by Contract or otherwise; and all such rights
herein and otherwise shall be enforceable by such Company Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Buyer, the Vionic Entities and their respective successors and assigns.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding
(whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made or Threatened
against any Company Indemnified Party or any other party covered by directors
and officers liability insurance, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(f)_ shall not require Buyer to
take any action to extend the DandO Tail Policy.

Section 8.04 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns_. Sellers Representative shall timely
prepare or cause to be prepared all Income Tax Returns for each of the Vionic
Entities for all taxable periods that end prior to or on the Closing Date
which are first due (taking into account all applicable extensions) after the
Closing (each a  _"_ _Seller Return_ _"_ ). All Seller Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with past practice and without a change of any
election or accounting method (in each case, except to the extent otherwise
required by Applicable Law). Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (taking into account all applicable extensions) for filing any such
Seller Return, the Sellers Representative shall deliver a copy of such
Seller Return to the Buyer for its review and reasonable comment. The Buyer
will cooperate with Sellers Representatives in connection with the filing of
the Seller Returns including making available a post-Closing officer or legal
representative of the applicable Vionic Entity to execute such Seller Returns
on behalf of the applicable Vionic Entities. Not later than five (5) days
prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Seller Return,
Sellers Representative shall pay to the Buyer, out of the Sellers
Representative Holdback, or to the extent such Sellers Representative
Holdback is insufficient, Sellers shall pay to the Buyer, the amount of any
Taxes with respect to such Seller Return. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Taxes that the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.04(a)_ shall be without duplication of any Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent
such Pre-Closing Taxes were taken into account in the Final Closing
Indebtedness as a reduction in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

 



\- 68 -

    

(b) _Pre-Closing  Non-Income Tax Returns and Straddle Returns_. Except as
otherwise set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.04(j)_, the Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to be filed by any Vionic
Entity after the Closing for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than such Tax
Returns that are Seller Returns), and all Tax Returns required to be filed by
any Vionic Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
ownership of Vionic Europe) or any Property Tax Returns with respect to
ownership of the VCG Intellectual Property for all Straddle Periods (each a
_"_ _Buyer Return_ _"_ ). Buyer Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past practice and without a change of any election or
accounting method (in each case, except to the extent otherwise required by
Applicable Law). Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing any such Buyer Return (other than a Buyer Return relating to sales,
use, payroll or other Taxes that is required to be filed contemporaneously
with, or promptly after, the close of a Tax period), the Buyer shall deliver
a copy of such Buyer Return to the Sellers Representative for its review and
reasonable comment. The Buyer will cause Buyer Returns to be timely filed and
will provide a copy to Sellers Representative. Not later than five (5) days
prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Buyer Return,
Sellers Representative shall pay to the Buyer, out of the Sellers
Representative Holdback, or to the extent such Sellers Representative
Holdback is insufficient, Sellers shall pay to the Buyer, the amount of any
Taxes with respect to such Buyer Return attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending as of the Closing
(determined in accordance with Section 8.04(c)). For the avoidance of doubt,
the Taxes that the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.04(b)_ shall be without duplication of any Pre-Closing Taxes to the
extent such Pre-Closing Taxes were taken into account in the Final Closing
Indebtedness as a reduction in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

(c) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. Taxes payable by or with respect to
any Vionic Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the
ownership of any Vionic Entity) or that are imposed with respect to the
ownership of VCG Intellectual Property with respect to any Straddle Period
shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the
Closing as follows: (i) to the extent feasible, on a specific identification
basis, according to the date and time of the event or transaction giving rise
to such Tax, (ii) with respect to periodically assessed ad valorem Taxes and
other similar periodic Taxes, in proportion to the number of days in such
Straddle Period occurring through the Closing Date compared to the total
number of days in such Straddle Period, and (iii) in the case of any other
Tax, in an amount equal to such Tax that would be payable if the relevant
Straddle Period ended at the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the Tax period of any partnership or other pass-through entity, or
any "controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957(a) of
the Code, in which any Company or Company Subsidiary holds a beneficial
interest, will be deemed to close at such time). Any Tax credits relating to
any Straddle Periods shall be taken into account as though the relevant
taxable period ended as of the Closing. All determinations necessary to give
effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with
prior practices of the Vionic Entities except to the extent otherwise
required by Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any Tax liability
resulting from an increase in income pursuant to Section 965 of the Code
(whether or not an election was made under Section 965(h) of the Code) and
(ii) any Tax liability resulting from an inclusion pursuant to Sections 951 or
951A of the Code with respect to the ownership of Vionic Europe for periods
prior to the Closing shall be treated as a Pre-Closing Tax or as allocable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the Closing, and Sellers shall
pay all such Taxes.

 



\- 69 -

    

(d) _Tax Elections; Amended Returns_. Except in connection with an audit
resolved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.04(e)_ (including consistent
correlative adjustments to Tax Returns for non-audited taxable periods), no
Party or Affiliate of a Party may amend or cause the amendment of a Tax
Return of any Vionic Entity, or file or amend any Tax election, concerning any
Vionic Entity, in each case, with respect to any taxable period or portion
thereof ending prior to or as of the Closing without the written consent
of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Buyer shall, upon request by Sellers
Representative, cooperate in the preparation of and submission to the proper
Taxing Authority of any amended Tax Return with respect to any Vionic Entity
for any taxable period beginning before the Closing that is necessary to cause
such Tax Return to be consistent with adjustments to a Tax Return for any
other taxable period proposed by a Taxing Authority, or that is otherwise
required by Applicable Law to be filed.

(e) _Audits and Contests Regarding Taxes_. Any Party who receives, or whose
Affiliate receives, any notice of a pending or Threatened Tax audit,
assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to any Vionic Entity that
may give rise to a liability of the Sellers shall promptly notify
the Sellers Representative within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of
such notice; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
relieve any Party of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement, unless and
only to the extent such Party is adversely and materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Buyer and the Sellers Representative each agree to consult with
and to keep the other informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any
Tax audit or proceeding to the extent that such audit or proceeding could
affect a liability of the other Party. The Sellers Representative shall have
the right to represent the interests of the Vionic Entities in any Tax audit
or administrative or judicial proceeding pertaining solely to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and to employ counsel of its choice, who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer, at the Sellers expense; _provided_ that
the Sellers may not settle or compromise any such audit or proceeding without
the Buyers written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ _further_ that the Buyer shall have the
right to participate in any such audit or proceeding at its own expense, and
shall be entitled to control the disposition of any issue involved in such
audit or proceeding that does not materially affect a potential liability of
the Sellers. Both the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled
to represent their own interests in light of their responsibilities for the
related Taxes, each at their own expense, in any Tax audit or administrative
or judicial proceedings involving a taxable period of any Vionic Entity that
begins before and ends after the Closing or involving both a taxable period of
any Vionic Entity ending prior to or as of the Closing and a taxable period
ending after the Closing, and no such audit or proceeding may be settled or
compromised by the Sellers Representative or the Buyer without the consent of
both the Sellers Representative and the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. To the extent there is a
conflict between the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.04(e)_, on the one
hand, and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.05_, on the other hand, with
respect to any Tax audit or proceeding, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
8.04(e)_ shall govern.

 



\- 70 -

    

(f) _Overpayments of Taxes_. To the extent that any determination of Tax
liability, whether as the result of an audit or examination, a claim for
refund, the filing of an amended Tax Return or otherwise, results in a Tax
refund, or a credit against Taxes in lieu of a refund, with respect to Taxes
that were paid by a Vionic Entity or the Sellers with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or portion thereof, the Buyer shall promptly pay the amount
of such Tax refund or credit against Taxes, and the interest received thereon,
to Sellers Representative for distribution to the Sellers (in accordance
with their respective Seller Allocation Percentage) upon receipt (or, in the
case of a credit, the utilization thereof) by the Buyer or its Affiliates (net
of any costs incurred by the Buyer or its Affiliates in obtaining such
refunds or credits), unless and to the extent that the entitlement to any
refund or credit (i) was taken into account as a reduction in computing the
amount of indemnified Loss in respect of such Taxes or (ii) was reflected as
an asset in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

(g) _Cooperation, Access to Information, and Records Retention_. The Sellers
Representative and the Buyer shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns as provided herein and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Vionic Entities. Such cooperation shall
include the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Buyer
agrees (i) to retain all books and records relevant to Taxes of the
Vionic Entities or the Sellers that are in the possession of the Vionic
Entities after the Closing (including Tax Returns) relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing until the expiration of the statute of
limitations for assessment of Taxes for such respective taxable period, and
(ii) to give Sellers Representative reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records prior to the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and, if Sellers
Representative so request, the Buyer shall allow Sellers Representative to
take possession of or copy such books and records.

 

(h) _Seller Employee Bonus Payment Deductions_. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any Seller Employee Bonus Payments will be treated as an item
of expense and deducted on a Seller Return. To the extent any deduction
attributable to the Seller Employee Bonus Payments (i) is properly deductible
as an item of expense on a Tax Return filed by Buyer or a Vionic Entity after
the Closing Date that is not a Seller Return and (ii) is not used to offset
Taxes otherwise allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending as of the
Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.04(c)_ (the " _Post-Closing Seller
Employee Bonus Payments_ "), then Buyer will pay over (or cause to be paid
over) an amount equal to 24% of the Post-Closing Seller Employee Bonus
Payments to the Sellers Representative for distribution to the Equity
Sellers, in accordance with the percentage that is equal to their respective
Seller Allocation Percentage divided by the aggregate Seller Allocation
Percentages of all Equity Sellers, within 10 days after timely filing the Tax
Return (taking into account any extensions of time) for the taxable period in
which such Post-Closing Seller Employee Bonus Payments are deducted (or, if
not timely filed, the date on which such Tax Return was required to be filed
taking into account extensions of time).

 



\- 71 -

    

(i) For all U.S. federal Income Tax purposes (and state and local Tax purposes
where applicable), the Sellers and the Buyer acknowledge that the Equity
Purchase is intended to be treated in a manner consistent with the principles
set forth in Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1991-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2): (A) to the
Equity Sellers, as a sale of partnership interests, and (B) to the Buyer, as
a purchase of the assets of the Companies (and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable). Neither the Buyer nor the Sellers shall file any Tax Return or
otherwise take any position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with or
contrary to the treatment described in the preceding sentence unless required
to do so by Applicable Law.

(j)  _State Sales Tax Liabilities_. Vionic Group has Liabilities for sales or
use Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (the " _State Sales Tax
Liabilities_ "). Following the Closing, the Sellers Representative shall
continue the process of entering into, or request, as appropriate, voluntary
disclosure agreements or similar arrangements (each, a " _VDA_ ") from the
applicable Taxing Authorities listed on _Schedule 8.04(j)_ relating to
certain State Sales Tax Liabilities (each, a " _VDA Proceeding_ ").

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, solely with respect to
Tax Proceedings initiated by a Taxing Authority solely related to a State
Sales Tax Liability (the " _State Sales Tax Liability Proceedings_ ") or
VDA Proceedings (collectively, " _Sales Tax Proceedings_ "), the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to control, and shall pursue, any such
process or proceeding (including the amendment, preparation and filing of
sales or use Tax Returns as required by the relevant Taxing Authorities)
relating to any Sales Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , (A) the Buyer
shall have the right (but not the duty) to (1) participate in any Sales Tax
Proceeding, (2) attend any meetings or conferences with any Taxing Authority
relating to a Sales Tax Proceeding, (3) consult with the Sellers
Representative concerning the conduct of a Sales Tax Proceeding, and (4)
employ counsel, solely at its own expense, (B) at least seven (7) days prior
to the submission of any letters, documents or calculations to a Taxing
Authority in connection with a Sales Tax Proceeding, the Sellers
Representative shall deliver a copy of such letters, documents or
calculations to the Buyer for its review and reasonable comment, (C) the
Sellers Representative shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed of the status
of any Sales Tax Proceeding, and (D) the Sellers Representative shall not
settle or compromise any such Sales Tax Proceeding without the Buyers prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 

(ii) All payments to Taxing Authorities with respect to State Sales Tax
Liabilities and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Sellers Representative or any Vionic Entity after the Closing related to the
Sales Tax Proceedings shall be paid from the Tax Escrow Account, to the extent
of available funds, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid to a Taxing Authority
by any Vionic Entity after the Closing with respect to State Sales Tax
Liabilities or other expenses incurred by any Vionic Entity after the Closing
with respect to a Sales Tax Proceeding shall, to the extent not fully funded
by the Tax Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.04(j)_, be
considered a Loss subject to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ of
this Agreement and, subject to the terms of _Article 11_ , the Buyer
Indemnified Persons remedies for any such Losses shall not be limited to the
Tax Escrow Amount.

 



\- 72 -

    

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amendment,
preparation and filing of any sales or use Tax Return required to be filed
pursuant to a Sales Tax Proceeding, shall be governed by this _Section_ __ _
8.04(j)_.

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.04(j)_
shall prohibit the Buyer or any Vionic Entity from requesting a VDA from (i)
any Taxing Authority not listed on _Schedule 8.04(j)_ , or (ii) any Taxing
Authority listed on _Schedule 8.04(j)_ with respect to any Tax Returns or
Taxes other than sales or use Tax Returns or Taxes. 

Section 8.05 _Certain Additional Covenants_.

 

(a) _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, for a period of
six (6) years (or a shorter period of time to the extent consistent with the
Buyers generally applicable document retention policies then in effect) the
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Vionic Entities to, upon reasonable written
notice and where Sellers Representative has a legitimate business purpose
for so requesting, provide the Sellers Representative and its authorized
representatives, with commercially reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of
the Vionic Entities with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the
Closing Date to the extent such books and records are reasonably relevant (as
determined by Buyer, acting reasonably) (a) to the Sellers status as
equityholders of the Companies during such period or (b) with respect to any
claims made against or incurred by the Sellers (but excluding any claim or
dispute relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions),
subject to customary confidentiality protections; _provided_ , that such
access does not interfere in any material respect with the normal operations
of the Vionic Entities; and _provided_ , _further_ that in no event shall
Buyer or its Affiliates be required to take any action that would constitute
a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege; and _provided_ , _further_
, that in no event shall Buyer or its Affiliates be required to supply
Sellers Representative or its agents with any information that Buyer or its
Affiliates (in Buyers reasonable judgment) are under a legal obligation not
to supply. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Sellers, the Buyer
shall not, and shall not permit the Vionic Entities to, for a period of six
(6) years following the Closing Date (or such shorter period of time as is
consistent with the Buyers generally applicable document retention policies
then in effect), destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and
records of the Vionic Entities for any period prior to the Closing Date
without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Sellers and offering the
Sellers the opportunity to copy the books and records or any portion
thereof which the Buyer or the Vionic Entities may intend to destroy, alter
or dispose of. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(a)_ shall
not apply to Tax books and records, which are the subject of  _Section_ __ _
8.04(g)_.

(b) _Representation and Warranty Policy_. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy
to be issued, solely at Buyers cost (other than the RandW Contribution, which
shall be paid by the Sellers as a Seller Transaction Expense as provided
herein), promptly after the Closing (in accordance with the terms of the
binder thereof) and shall take reasonable actions within its control with the
intent to cause such policy to remain in full force and effect thereafter.
Buyer shall not take actions with the intention of causing such policy to be
terminated, cancelled or amended, waived or cancelled in a manner that would
have a material and adverse impact on Sellers.

 



\- 73 -

    

(c) _Seller Release_. As a material inducement to the Buyers willingness to
enter into and perform this Agreement and to purchase the Equity Interests
and the VCG Intellectual Property for the consideration to be paid or provided
to the Sellers in connection with such purchase, as of the Closing, each

each Releasee from any and all actions, Liabilities, losses, damages, costs,
or expenses whatsoever (including any claims for contribution for any
liability under this Agreement) ( _"_ _Claims_ _"_ ), in each case, based in

Releasees on account of or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever
prior to the Closing, including any matter related to the business or
operations of the Vionic Entities or the Asset Seller or the issuance or

or permit the filing or initiation on its behalf of, any lawsuit of any kind
whatsoever, or any complaint or charge against Buyer, each Vionic Entity,
their Affiliates or any of their respective representatives with respect to

foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_ will operate to
waive or release any Claims, whether known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, matured or unmatured, whether arising at law or in equity (a)
that any Releasor has under this Agreement, any exhibit or schedule hereto,
or any agreements, certificates or other documents entered into in accordance

Transactions, including any Ancillary Document, (b) relating to actual fraud

_"_ ) shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates, agents, consultants and
advisors to hold, in strict confidence all such Confidential Information
furnished to it by the Buyer (or, in the case of the Sellers with respect to
the Business Confidential Information, by any Vionic Entity) or any Seller, as

representatives in connection with

 this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Transaction (or, in the case
of the Sellers with respect to the Business Confidential Information, in
connection with their prior relationship with the Vionic Entities and the
Business), and the Receiving Party shall not release or disclose such
Confidential Information to any other Person or entity, except its auditors,
attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and
advisors, unless compelled to disclose such Confidential Information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Applicable Law
or so as not to violate the rules of any stock exchange; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of disclosure compelled by judicial or
administrative process, Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange, the
Receiving Party shall (to the extent reasonably practical and permitted by
Applicable Law) notify the Disclosing Party promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Disclosing Party may, at the Disclosing Partys sole
cost and expense, seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.05(d)_. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is
compelled to disclose any Confidential Information by judicial or
administration process, requirement of Applicable Law or the rules of any
stock exchange, such Receiving Party may so disclose the Confidential
Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the written request of the
Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed; _provided_ , _further_ , that that the foregoing obligations of
confidentiality shall not extend to Confidential Information that is (i)
properly in the public domain through no fault of such the Receiving Party in
violation of this Agreement or (ii) disclosed to such Receiving Party by a
Third Party who may lawfully do so and who was not under any confidentiality
obligation with respect thereto. The Sellers Representative agrees that any
information provided to it or otherwise obtained by it in connection with this
Agreement, including the existence and terms of this Agreement, and including
in connection with the transactions contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ and
_Article 11_ of this Agreement (regardless of whether such information is
designated as confidential and regardless of the manner in which it is
furnished), and any analysis, compilations, studies, documents or records that
contain or reflect such information shall be maintained in confidence and used
only in the Sellers Representatives capacity as such in the context of this
Agreement, including the purposes set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ and
_Article 11_ , and the Sellers Representative shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates to not disclose such information to any Third Party;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that that the foregoing obligations of confidentiality shall not
extend to information that is (i) properly in the public domain through no
fault of such the Sellers Representative in violation of this Agreement or
(ii) disclosed to Sellers Representative by a Third Party who may lawfully do
so and who was not under any confidentiality obligation with respect thereto.

 

Section 8.06 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. 

(a) Christopher Gallagher acknowledges that he is the sole member of CGVIO LLC
and that he and members of his immediate family are beneficiaries of the
Nintai Trust U/A dated November 24, 2006 and C. Bruce Campbell acknowledges
that he is the sole trustee of the Campbell Family Irrevocable Trust U/A dated
October 6, 2006, that members of his immediate family are the beneficiaries
thereof and that such trust is the sole member of Viocam Investments LLC.
Accordingly, each of Christopher Gallagher and C. Bruce Campbell will obtain a
substantial benefit from the payment to such Sellers that will result 

 



\- 75 -

    

 from the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, each of Christopher
Gallagher and C. Bruce Campbell has played a material and direct role in the
development and operation of the Business. As such, in order to protect the
value of the Equity Interests and the VCG Intellectual Property being acquired
by Buyer hereunder (including the goodwill inherent therein), each of
Christopher Gallagher and C. Bruce Campbell is agreeing to the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.06_ as a Non-Compete Party.

(b) The Sellers and the Non-Compete Parties hereby expressly acknowledge (i)
Buyers substantial investment in the Business and the Vionic Entities,
including their good will, customer relationships, employee relationships,
Intellectual Property rights, and other proprietary and/or confidential
information and (ii) Buyers present intent to expand upon the scope,
geographic, industry, types of services and otherwise, of the
Vionic Entities relationships with their current and former customers. Each
Seller and each Non-Compete Party further acknowledges that if such Person
deprives Buyer of the goodwill of Business or the Vionic Entities or in any
manner utilizes the reputation and goodwill of the Business or the Vionic
Entities in competition with Buyer, Buyer will be deprived of the benefits it
is paying for pursuant to this Agreement. Accordingly, the Sellers and the
Non-Compete Parties, including Christopher Gallagher and C. Bruce Campbell, as
an inducement for Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Transactions, agree to the covenants, restrictions and obligations contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 8.06_.

(c) For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Closing Date (the _"_
_Restricted Period_ _"_ ), the Non-Compete Parties shall not, acting
individually or as an owner, shareholder, member, manager, director,
partner, employee or independent contractor of any Person other than the
Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and shall not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to, (i) engage in or assist others in engaging in the Business
anywhere in the world (the  _"_ _Territory_ _"_ ), (ii) own, manage, operate,
assist, join, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation
or control of, or be connected as an owner, shareholder, member,
manager, director, partner, employee or independent contractor or otherwise
with, any business anywhere in the Territory that, directly or indirectly,
competes with the Business regardless of the channel through which such
competition occurs and regardless of the Persons whom such competition
targets, (iii) call on or solicit any customer, client, strategic partner,
vendor, supplier, consultant, contractor, licensee, licensor or other material
business relation (collectively, " _Excluded Persons_ ") of any Vionic Entity
or any of its Affiliates (including any Excluded Persons of any Vionic Entity
at any time during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the
Closing Date), in order to induce or attempt to induce such Excluded Person
to utilize the services of a competing business, to cease doing, or reduce
such Persons level of, business with such Vionic Entity or any of its
Affiliates, or in any way materially interfere with the relationship between
any Excluded Person and any Vionic Entity or any of its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) as applied to Steven G. Mabb only, the
Restricted Period described herein shall mean a period of three (3) years
commencing on the Closing Date, and (ii) each Non-Compete Party may own,
directly or indirectly, solely as a passive investment, securities of any
Person traded on any national securities exchange if such Non-Compete Party is
not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such
Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of
securities of such Person.

 



\- 76 -

    

(d) During the Restricted Period, the Sellers and the Non-Compete Parties
shall not, acting individually or as an owner, shareholder, member, manager,
director, partner, employee or independent contractor of any Person other than
the Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and shall not permit any of their
respective Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee
of the Vionic Entities or their Affiliates or encourage any such employee to
leave such employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment,
except to the extent such employee responds to a general solicitation that is
not directed specifically to any such employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06(d)_ shall prevent any Seller, any Non-
Compete Party or any of their respective Affiliates from hiring, not earlier
than 180 days from the date of termination of employment, any employee whose
employment with a Vionic Entity or Buyer or any Affiliate thereof has been
terminated.

(e) Because a remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.06_ hereof will be inadequate, in addition to all other
remedies available to the Buyer, the Buyer shall have the right to seek and
obtain, without posting any bond or other security, a restraining order,
injunction or other equitable relief to enforce the provisions or prevent any
violations (whether anticipatory, continuing or future) of this _Section_ __ _
8.06_.

 

(f) The Sellers and the Non-Compete Parties agree that the territorial, time
and other restrictions set forth in _8.06(c)_ and _(d)_ hereof are
reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the business
and affairs of the Buyer effective from and after the Closing, and in the
event that any one or more of such territorial, time or other restrictions is
found to be unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction as applied to a
Seller or the Non-Compete Party, such Seller and/or Non-Compete Party shall
agree and submit to the reduction of said territorial, time or other
restrictions to such an area, the time period, or otherwise as such court may
determine to be reasonable. The Sellers and the Non-Compete Parties
specifically acknowledge and agree that, although Delaware law governs this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.08,_ the limitations set forth in
this Agreement are also valid under Section 16601 of the California Business
and Professions Code and hereby irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or
indirectly asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be
commenced) any suit, action, or proceeding of any kind that would contest
such restrictions as being invalid under California law. It is the desire
and intent of the Parties to this Agreement that the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.06_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the
Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought, and each such Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the state,
provincial and federal courts in any such jurisdiction. In the event that any
restriction set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.06_ hereof is found to be
unreasonable or otherwise invalid in any jurisdiction, in whole or in
part, the Parties hereby agree that such restrictions shall remain and be
valid in all other jurisdictions.

Section 8.07 _Replacement of Guarantees and Letters of Credit_. The Buyer and
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange, prior to the
Closing, for replacement arrangements with respect to the letters of credit
and related obligations listed on  _Schedule 8._ _07_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedules.

with identifying the order of notices of claims for certain types of
indemnification claims by Buyer hereunder, and that it is not intended, and
shall not, affect, modify or change any obligations of the insurer under and
pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Policy. In the case of any
indemnifiable Losses owed to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 11.02_ which arise from an Individual Breach, Buyer shall seek recovery
solely from such applicable breaching Seller and any such amounts shall be
paid directly by such breaching Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Representation and Warranty Policy shall be deemed to not cover Losses
for indemnification obligations of Sellers, (i) until such time that the
Retention has been fully eroded (or claims have been delivered that when paid,
would cause the Retention to be fully eroded), (ii) in connection with any
Losses subject to exclusions or as to which coverage is not available under
the Representation and Warranty Policy, or (iii) following such time as the
policy limits of the Representation and Warranty Policy have been exhausted.
With respect to any Losses for which any Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to diligently make and pursue claims for such Losses under
the Representation and Warranty Policy in good faith to the extent such
policy would cover such Losses or any portion thereof,

 



\- 83 -

    

 provided, however, the Parties acknowledge that the Buyer Indemnified Person
shall have no obligation to litigate or arbitrate with respect to any coverage
position taken by the insurer under the Representation and Warranty Policy
unless the Sellers Representative (i) specifically requests in writing that
Buyer does so, (ii) agrees (on behalf of Sellers) in writing to, and complies
at all times with such agreement, fund in advance all reasonable costs or
expenses associated therewith and (iii) delivers to Buyer a written opinion of
outside counsel that there exists a reasonable basis under the Representation
and Warranty Policy for the coverage position requested to be advanced by
Buyer in any such coverage dispute with the insurer. Provided that the
foregoing preconditions described in (i)-(iii) above are satisfied, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such coverage litigation
or arbitration (with counsel of its selection) at the reasonable direction of
the Sellers Representative and shall keep the Sellers Representative
informed on a reasonably current basis of the progress of such litigation or
arbitration proceeding. Subject to the express provisions of _Section_ __ _
11.06(h)_, including the requirement to provide any applicable notice to the
insurer under the Representation and Warranty Policy as set forth above, no
Buyer Indemnified Person shall have any further obligation to seek to collect
or actually collect upon any coverage under the Representation and Warranty
Policy or other applicable policy of insurance as a precondition to asserting
a claim for indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.04(b)_ shall continue to apply to any such claim.

 

(c) Except in the case of a disputed claim described in subsection (d), (i) if
any indemnification payment is to be made from the Indemnity Escrow Account,
Sellers Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay such amount not
more than twenty (20) days after any Buyer Indemnified Party provides notice
to Sellers Representative of such amount, and (ii) if any indemnification
payment is to be made by Sellers or any Seller directly, Sellers or such
Seller shall pay such amount not more than twenty (20) days after any Buyer
Indemnified Party provides notice to the Seller(s) of such amount.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party disputes the validity or amount of any claim for
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall so notify in writing
the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Indemnifying
Party receives notice from the Indemnified Party of such claim, specifying in
reasonable detail the points of disagreement. Upon receipt of such notice of
dispute, the Indemnified Party shall promptly consult with the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such points of disagreement in an effort to resolve the
dispute. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, if any such dispute
cannot be resolved by the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party within
thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnifying Party receives notice from
the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party may file suit with respect
to any amounts in dispute in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
any other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.05 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Person
hereunder (a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is
actually known to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right of a Person to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a
Third Person

 



\- 84 -

    

 shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and
then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _
11.05_, the Indemnifying Party shall then have the right, upon written notice
to the Indemnified Party (a " _Defense Notice_ ") within fifteen (15) days
after receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate,
contest, or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person
Claim_ "), provided that the Indemnifying Party has irrevocably acknowledged
to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify, in accordance
with this _Article 11_ and subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.04_ and _11.06_
hereof, the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third
Person Claim and to discharge any cost or expense arising out of such
investigation, contest, or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter
participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim
with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is
necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation
shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the
Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control
defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full
amount of the reasonable costs of defense. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party shall fail to give the Defense Notice within said fifteen (15) day
period, (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have the control over
said defense and settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified Party such
assistance and materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the
defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing, and the Indemnifying Party,
if it is required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, will be
liable for all costs and settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection
therewith. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner
in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount
or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the
Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim
constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make
available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating
to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof,
including cooperation with any insurer to the extent applicable.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with
respect to such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) days after receipt
thereof and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject claim, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have control over said defense
and, subject to the provisions set forth below, settlement of the
subject claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make
available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance and materials as it may
reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have the rights at
its expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing. In such an event, the Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless (A)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii)
the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such Third Person Claims effected without its consent, in
which cases the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required.

 



\- 85 -

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section_ __
_ 11.05_, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may
participate in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control, including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or
settlement of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) that involves criminal allegations against the
Indemnified Party, (iii) that involves a customer or supplier of the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or a Governmental Entity, (iv) that, if
unsuccessful, would set a precedent that would materially interfere with, or
have a material adverse effect on, the business or financial condition of the
Indemnified Party, or (v) that imposes liability on the part of the
Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. In such event, the Indemnifying Party will still
be subject to its obligations hereunder, and the Indemnified Party will not
settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
acknowledge that, to the extent required by an insurer under the
Representation and Warranty Policy or any other applicable policy of insurance
in connection with any claim made by a Buyer Indemnified Person thereunder,
the conduct of the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim may be
assigned to counsel selected or approved by the insurer under the
Representation and Warranty Policy or other applicable policy of insurance, or
otherwise conducted in coordination with the insurer under the Representation
and Warranty Policy or other applicable policy of insurance, in each case
without prejudice to the rights of the Parties hereunder, and the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer Indemnified Persons will reasonably cooperate at
Buyers expense with the insurer under the Representation and Warranty Policy
or other applicable policy of insurance and such counsel in the defense of the
Third Party Claim and otherwise comply with the requirements of the
Representation and Warranty Policy or other applicable policy of insurance
applicable to such Party in connection therewith.

Section 11.06 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

 

(a) In no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for any obligation to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons against, or reimburse any Buyer
Indemnified Persons for, any Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.02(a_) in
respect of the Special Seller Fundamental Representations exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount.

 

(b) Except in the case of Fraud, and subject to the specific cap described in
_Sections 11.06(a)_ hereof with respect to certain claims as provided
therein, no Seller shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons
against, or reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Persons for, any Losses pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ after the aggregate amount of all payments made by
such Seller hereunder in respect of such Losses (to avoid doubt, including any
payments made in respect of the Special Seller Fundamental Representations)
equals the amount of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller
(provided that for this purpose, the Seller Allocation Percentage of each of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Tax Escrow Amount shall be deemed to have
been actually received by such Seller).

 



\- 86 -

    

(c) No Seller shall have, and each Seller hereby waives, any claim for
contribution or indemnification from or against any of the Vionic Entities as
a result of any indemnification or other payments made by any Seller to any of
the Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(d) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Buyer or its Representatives of the Vionic Entities, the Asset Seller or any
of their respective businesses, assets, liabilities or otherwise shall in any
way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification or other claim by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Person under
this Agreement. 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
all "material" or similar materiality type qualifications contained in the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be ignored
and not given any effect for the indemnification provisions of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, for purposes of (i) determining the amount of
any Losses incurred with respect to the indemnification provisions hereof and
(ii) determining whether or not a breach of a representation or warranty has
occurred.

 

(f) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates under insurance policies maintained by the Vionic
Entities, in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and applicable to
such Losses (the " _Existing Policies_ "), net of reasonable expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery. Buyer will (and
will cause the Vionic Entities to) use commercially reasonably efforts to seek
full recovery under such Existing Policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to first submit or to collect upon
any applicable insurance coverage as a precondition to making a claim for
indemnification hereunder or obtaining indemnification for Losses therefor. To
the extent that any insurance payment under the Existing Policies is actually
recovered by a Buyer Indemnified Person after the related indemnification
payment has been made pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Person
will pay over to the Escrow Agent (to the extent that amounts of applicable
Losses have been paid to Buyer out of the Indemnity Escrow Account and the
Escrow Agreement remains in effect) or to the Sellers Representative, on
behalf of the Sellers (in any other circumstance) the amounts of such
insurance payments promptly after they are actually recovered (net of
reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such
recovery).

 

(g) In connection with an Indemnified Partys rights for any claim under this
_Article 11_ an Indemnified Party may not seek punitive or exemplary damages,
except to the extent such punitive or exemplary damages are recovered by or
paid to Third Persons.

 



\- 87 -

    

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Buyer Indemnified
Person to make claims against the Representation and Warranty Policy or any
other applicable policy of insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall an Indemnified Party be entitled to recover damages or obtain
indemnity to the extent that the Indemnified Party shall have otherwise
actually recovered for such matter pursuant to any other provision of this
Agreement (and any such actual recovery pursuant to the Existing Policies or
Representations and Warranty Policy shall be deemed to be an actual recovery
hereunder), so as to avoid duplication or "double counting" of the same Loss
and in such case in the event that Sellers were the first payor of such Losses
otherwise reimbursed by other means, the applicable Buyer Indemnified Persons
shall promptly pay over to Sellers in proportion to their respective Seller
Allocation Percentage such excess necessary so as to avoid double counting of
the same Losses; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party may
pursue indemnification pursuant to multiple provisions of this _Article 11_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
limitation on indemnification provided in this _Article 11_ or any other
provision of this Agreement shall apply to any Losses in the case of Fraud.

 

Section 11.07 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered, to the extent
permissible under Applicable Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax purposes).

 

Section 11.08 _Tax Indemnity Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, and further notwithstanding the identity of any
Buyer Indemnified Person, any payment due from the Sellers in respect of any
matter falling within _Section_ __ _ 11.02(d)_ shall, if and to the extent
that the relevant Tax is Tax of Vionic Europe, be due and payable by the
Sellers to the Buyer only and any payment made shall, to that extent, be paid
by the Sellers to the Buyer only and shall not in any circumstances be due and
payable and/or paid to the relevant Buyer Indemnified Person.

 

Section 11.09 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to Fraud, except for the
right of a Party hereto to pursue specific performance pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 12.13_, except for the rights of the Parties under _Section_ __ _ 3.03_
and _Section_ __ _ 8.06_ (and without limitation of any such right) and
except for the rights and obligations of the Parties under _Section_ __ _
12.17_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions in this _Article 11_ of this Agreement shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties hereto and their respective
Affiliates against each other with respect to any claim related to or arising
from this Agreement, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the
performance by the Parties of their respective obligations hereunder, or the
Transactions, _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement limits the right of
any party to pursue any remedies or enforce any rights specifically provided
for in any agreement that is an Ancillary Document executed in connection
with the Transactions in accordance with the terms thereof.

Section 12.08 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
negotiation, construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this
Agreement, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 12.09 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Except for such disputes
as are to be resolved under _Section_ __ _ 3.03(b)_ pursuant to the terms
thereof, the Parties agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in Delaware Court of
Chancery sitting in Wilmington, Delaware and, in the event that such court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the applicable Proceeding, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any
such Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided
in  _Section_ __ _ 12.07_ shall be deemed effective service of process on
such Party. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS
THAT ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY,
AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 12.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers Representative, on behalf of itself and
on behalf of all Sellers, on the other hand. No waiver by any Party of any
provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party making such
waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

 



\- 92 -

    

Section 12.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held to
be invalid or unenforceable under Applicable Law in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 12.12 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each
representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have independent
significance. Any reference in this Agreement to a statute shall be to such
statute, as amended from time to time, and to the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

Section 12.13 _Specific Performance_ _._

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary relief, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if the Parties fail to take
any action required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions. It
is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement, (i)
the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and (subject to court approval) to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 12.09_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific
performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the Transactions
and without that right, neither the Sellers nor the Buyer would have entered
into this Agreement.

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 12.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 12.14 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its directors, members, partners, managers, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that the Companies, certain of the Sellers, and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, other than the Vionic Entities, the
" _Seller Group_ ") have retained Hodgson Russ LLP (" _Hodgson Russ_ ") to
act as its counsel in connection with the Transactions. The Buyer, the
Sellers, Sellers Representative and the Vionic Entities and Asset Seller
hereby agree, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between the Buyer or Vionic Entities on the one hand, and the Seller Group, on
the other hand, Hodgson Russ may represent the Seller Group in such dispute
even though the interests of the Seller Group may be directly adverse to the
Buyer or the Vionic Entities, and even though Hodgson Russ may have
represented the Vionic Entities in a matter substantially related to such

 matters for the Buyer or any of the Vionic Entities; _provided_ , _however_
that Hodgson Russ agrees that no confidential information regarding Vionic
Entities that it has gained in connection with its representation of Seller
Group, and is not known to Seller Group prior to such disclosure, will be
conveyed or disclosed to any of them or otherwise used by Hodgson Russ to the
detriment of the Vionic Entities. The Buyer further agree that, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 12.14(b)_, as to all legally privileged communications among
Hodgson Russ, the Vionic Entities and the Seller Group to the extent relating
in any way to the Transactions (collectively, the " _Privileged
Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs to the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers
and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer or any of the Vionic
Entities. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.14(b)_, the Privileged Communications
are the property of the Sellers, and from and after the Closing none of the
Vionic Entities, or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the
Vionic Entities, will seek to obtain such Privileged Communications, whether
by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or through other means.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.14(b)_, as to any such Privileged
Communications prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Vionic Entities
together with any of their respective affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or
assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of the
Parties after the Closing. The Privileged Communications may be used by the
Seller Group in connection with any dispute that relates to the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 

(i) the Parties expressly agree that the Privileged Communications shall not
include or extend to any communications at or prior to the Closing between
the Seller Group, the Vionic Entities, or any of them, on the one hand, and
Hodgson Russ, on the other hand, which constitute, reflect or provide evidence
of Fraud by any member of the Seller Group or the Companies;

 

(ii) in the event that a dispute arises between the Buyer or any of the Vionic
Entities and a Third Party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of
their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Vionic Entities may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Hodgson Russ to such Third Party; provided, however,
that, subject to clause (iii) below, the Vionic Entities may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers;

 

(iii) nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 12.14_ (including _Section_ __
_ 12.14(b)(ii)_) will be deemed or construed as a waiver by Vionic Entities,
any Vionic Entity, Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any right or remedy
arising or resulting from the actions of Sellers Representative, the Sellers
or their agents or representatives.; and 

(iv) any communications, attorney-client privilege, work product protection,
right of confidentiality or other applicable privilege referred in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.14_, including but not limited to Privileged
Communications, shall also belong to Vionic Entities and shall be deemed
passed to and claimed by the Vionic Entities after the Closing solely to
the extent any such attorney-client privilege, work product protection, right
of confidentiality or

 



\- 94 -

    

 other applicable privilege is required to be waived or otherwise required to
be similarly released by any Governmental Entity, under Applicable Law or
pursuant to any Proceeding, and in any such case, the Vionic Entities and the
Buyer shall not be in breach or violation of any provision of this _Section_
__ _ 12.14 _for providing any information, documents, communications or
client confidences to any Governmental Entity or other Person in response to
and subject to the requirements of, and limitation in, the foregoing, provided
that, except to the extent otherwise requested or required by Applicable Law
or any such Governmental Entity, the Buyer gives the Sellers Representative
written notice of such Applicable Law or Proceeding promptly upon actual
knowledge thereof and allows the Sellers Representative a reasonable
opportunity to seek to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy
prior to such disclosure to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

(c) If and to the extent that Privileged Communications, or any portion
thereof, in the form of any electronic media or data (including, without
limitation, email communications) remain on storage media, networked storage
or other assets transferred to or made within the possession or control of the
Companies or any of the Vionic Entities from and after the Closing as a
result of the Transactions, such Privileged Communications shall become
subject to the document retention protocols of the Buyer and its Affiliates
applicable to similar classes of media or data, and may be destroyed in the
Ordinary Course of Business in accordance therewith. In administering and
applying such document retention protocols, none of Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates has any duty or obligation to identify or preserve any Privileged
Communications; any obligation to preserve Privileged Communications, however
arising, shall remain the exclusive obligation of the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 12.14_ shall
preclude any Person from asserting that particular communications which the
Sellers or any other Person deems Privileged Communications are not in fact
legally privileged.

 

Section 12.15 _Sellers_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Christopher T.
Gallagher and Daniel M. Sanner as his, her or its true, lawful and sole
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact (such individuals acting jointly in such
capacity, _"_ _Sellers_ __ _ Representative_ _"_ ) to act for and on behalf
of such Seller in all matters relating to or arising out of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents, including: (i) to consummate the Transactions; (ii)
to pay such Sellers expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
performance of this Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date hereof),
including by using funds from the Sellers Representative Holdback; (iii) to
disburse any funds received hereunder to each Seller; (iv) to endorse and
deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Equity Interests and
execute such further instruments of assignment as the Buyer shall reasonably
request; (v) to execute and deliver any Ancillary Documents, and any
amendment to such Ancillary Documents, and all other instruments and documents
of every kind incident to or otherwise relating to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents; (vi) to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of such
Seller any waiver, consents or amendment to this Agreement; (vii) to take any
and all actions which the Sellers Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the Sellers, including
(A) to assert or institute any claim, (B) investigate, defend, contest or
litigate any claim involving the Buyer, the Vionic

 



\- 95 -

    

 Entities or any Governmental Entity against the Sellers Representative or
the Sellers, and receive process on behalf of any or all Sellers in any such
claim and compromise or settle on such terms as the Sellers Representative
shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges
with respect to any such claim, (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and
petitions as the Sellers Representative may deem advisable or necessary, (D)
to dispute or refrain from disputing, on behalf of such Seller relative to any
amounts to be received by such Seller under this Agreement or any agreements
contemplated hereby, any claim made by the Buyer under this Agreement or
other agreements contemplated hereby, (E) to negotiate and compromise, on
behalf of such Seller, any dispute that may arise under, and exercise or
refrain from exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby, including any disputes under
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_ or _Article 11_ , (F) to execute, on behalf of such
Seller, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to
such dispute or remedy; (viii) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees related thereto; (ix)
to prepare or cause the Seller Returns to be prepared, including engaging
accountants for such purpose; (ix) to take all other actions to be taken by or
on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith; (x) to retain the Sellers
Representative Holdback, subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.15(f)_ hereof, and pay
amounts therefrom in accordance with this Agreement; (xi) to accept notices on
behalf of the Sellers or any individual Seller in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 12.07_; (xii) to finally and conclusively determine, at any time, the
applicable Seller Allocation Percentages; and (xiii) to do each and every act
and exercise any and all rights which such Seller, or the Sellers
collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement.
Each Seller shall be fully bound by the acts, decisions and agreements of
Sellers Representative taken and done pursuant to the authority herein
granted, and such Seller hereby confirms that Sellers Representative shall
do or cause to be done by virtue of its appointment as Sellers
Representative. The authority of Sellers Representative hereunder may be
exercised by Sellers Representative by the two individuals serving as
Sellers Representative signing jointly as Sellers Representative for each
Seller or, after listing all Sellers, executing an instrument, by signing
jointly as Sellers Representative for all of them. The Buyer and all other
Persons may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action
of Sellers Representative in all matters referred to in this Agreement.

 

(b) Each Seller agrees that the agency and proxy described in this _Section_
__ _ 12.15_ are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without
the consent of the Sellers Representative and shall survive the death,
incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller and
furthermore in the case of the Asset Seller, are intended to secure
an interest in property and the obligations of the Asset Seller. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 12.15_ shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees
and successors of each Seller, and any references in this Agreement to a
Seller or the Sellers shall mean and include the successors to the rights of
the Sellers hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws
of descent and distribution or otherwise. If any Seller dies or becomes
incapacitated, disabled or incompetent (such deceased, incapacitated, disabled
or incompetent Seller being a _"_ _Former Holder_ _"_ ) and, as a result, the
agency and power of attorney conferred by this _Section_ __ _ 12.15_ is
revoked by operation of law, it shall not be a breach by such Former Holder
under this Agreement if the heirs, beneficiaries, estate, administrator,
executor, guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such Former
Holder (each a _"_ _Successor Holder_ _"_ ) confirms the appointment of
Sellers Representative as 

 



\- 96 -

    

 agent and attorney-in-fact for such Successor Holder. In addition, if the
agency and power of attorney conferred by this _Section_ __ _ 12.15_ is
revoked by operation of law and thereafter not reconfirmed by the Successor
Holder prior to the Closing, such revocation shall not be deemed a breach by
the Successor Holder of any of the provisions of this Agreement provided that
the Equity Interests held by such Successor Holder are delivered for transfer
to the Buyer at the Closing as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, and
further provided that such Successor Holder executes and delivers such other
certificates, documents or instruments that would have been delivered on its
behalf by Sellers Representative had such Successor Holder reconfirmed the
agency and power of attorney conferred by this  _Section_ __ _ 12.15_. All
decisions and actions by Sellers Representative (to the extent authorized by
this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall
have the right to object, dissent, and protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) The Sellers agree that the Buyer, its Affiliates and the Vionic Entities
shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by Sellers Representative on
behalf of such Seller in all matters in which action by Sellers
Representative is required or permitted, or otherwise contemplated to be taken
by, Sellers Representative under this Agreement (an _"_ _Authorized Action_
_"_ ) and are hereby released and relieved from any liability to any Person
for (i) any acts or omissions by any of them in accordance with any
Authorized Action and (ii) any instructions, decisions or actions of the
Sellers Representative in any Authorized Action. Any notice delivered to the
Sellers Representative in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Seller. Each Seller agrees
that any Authorized Action shall be binding on each Seller as fully as if such
Seller had taken such Authorized Action. Each Seller (based on its Seller
Allocation Percentage) hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly and
severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers Representative
against all fees, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by Sellers Representative in connection with any action, suit or
Proceeding to which Sellers Representative is made a party by reason of the
fact it is or was acting as Sellers Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

(d) Sellers Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of, or any fiduciary duties to, any Seller,
except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other
document entered into in connection herewith, except that Sellers
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for
willful misconduct. Sellers Representative shall be entitled to rely on the
advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of Sellers Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event
subject Sellers Representative to liability to any Seller. Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by Sellers Representative in good faith, and if
any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have
been made in error, the sole recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due,
but not made, shall be to recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of
the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. Neither
Sellers Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability
to any Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of Sellers Representative
for any reason to consummate the Transactions or relating to the performance
of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting
Fraud or bad faith.

 



\- 97 -

    

(e) If Daniel M. Sanner shall resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill his
responsibilities hereunder, Alpine Investors IV SBIC, LP and Alpine Investors
IV, LP, acting together, may appoint a successor. If Christopher T. Gallagher
shall resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder,
C. Bruce Campbell shall be his successor, unless he is unable to serve. If C.
Bruce Campbell shall resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill his
responsibilities hereunder, a majority of the pre-Closing Board of Managers of
Vionic Group may act to appoint a successor. Either of the individuals
serving as Sellers Representative, or any successor appointed in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence, shall be discharged of his, her or
its duties hereunder upon the appointment of such a successor Sellers
Representative. Each such successor Sellers Representative shall have all the
power, authority, rights and privileges hereby conferred upon the original
Sellers Representative, and the term "Sellers Representative" as used
herein shall be deemed to include such successor Sellers Representative.

(f) Sellers Representative is entitled to pay on behalf of the Sellers, from
the Sellers Representative Holdback or from its own funds if the Sellers
Representative Holdback is not sufficient, any fees, costs and expenses
incurred by Sellers Representative in the performance of its duties
hereunder (whether prior to or after the Closing), and to the extent paid by
Sellers Representative from its own funds, obtain reimbursement from the
Sellers for, such fees, costs and expenses. If at any time Sellers
Representative determines, in its sole discretion, to release all or a portion
of the Sellers Representative Holdback to the Sellers, such payment will be
made in accordance with the Seller Allocation Percentage. Any fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other
advisors, if applicable) incurred by Sellers Representative in performing its
obligations under this Agreement in excess of the Sellers Representative
Holdback shall be borne by the Sellers in accordance with the Seller
Allocation Percentage and each Seller shall pay Sellers Representative such
Sellers share of such costs and expenses within ten (10) days after delivery
to such Seller by Sellers Representative of written notice thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, Sellers
Representative may withhold and retain from any payments to be made to the
Sellers such amount or amounts as it shall determine are necessary to pay all
known (or reasonably anticipated) expenses that are required to be paid or
borne by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, or are otherwise incurred
by Sellers Representative in the performance of its duties under this
Agreement (including all out of pocket expenses) and shall pay all such
expenses out of the amount or amounts so withheld.

 

(g) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by each Seller, Sellers Representative
shall not be entitled to any compensation for the performance of services
under this Agreement, but shall be entitled, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, to payment or reimbursement by the Sellers of all fees, costs
and expenses incurred as Sellers Representative. Neither the Vionic Entities
nor the Buyer will have any obligation to pay or reimburse Sellers
Representative for any of its expenses.

 



\- 98 -

    

(h) Christopher T. Gallagher and Daniel M. Sanner (or their successors) shall
act jointly as Sellers Representative for all purposes hereunder, and any
action taken by Sellers Representative shall require the unanimous approval
of such individuals. In the event that such individuals are in disagreement as
to any matter subject to the authority of Sellers Representative under this
Agreement (including under this _Section_ __ _ 12.15_), they shall each be
obligated to negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement, and if they
are unable to promptly resolve such disagreement, they shall engage a
mediator to facilitate such good faith negotiation and the resolution of any
such disagreement.

 

Section 12.16 _Termination of Members_ __ _Agreements_. Each Seller who is a
party to the applicable agreements noted in (a)-(b) below hereby agrees that,
effective as of the Closing, each of (a) the Amended and Restated Members
Agreement of Vionic Group dated as of January 1, 2017 and (b) the Amended and
Restated Members Agreement of Vionic International dated as of January 1,
2017 shall be terminated and of no further force or effect with no Liability
or Loss to any Vionic Entity. Each Seller hereby irrevocably waives any notice
or other procedural requirements pursuant to the agreements reflected in
clauses (a) and (b) with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction. On or
prior to the Closing, the applicable Equity Sellers who own each applicable
Company shall cause such applicable Company to acknowledge and agree to such
terminations pursuant to documentation consistent with the foregoing sentence
and in form and substance otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.

 

Section 12.17 _Certain Guarantees_.

ownership interest in the Asset Seller to cause the Asset Seller to take such

indirect ownership interest in the Asset Seller hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Persons the payment
as primary obligor (and not only of collectability) when due of any amounts
payable by the Asset Seller hereunder and the performance by the Asset Seller
of its covenants, agreements and obligations hereunder; provided that it is
agreed that each Equity Seller and each Individual Party shall only
be responsible hereunder on a several basis for that percentage of the

\- 99 -

    

(d) Each Individual Party agrees and acknowledges that the provisions of

binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any Party hereto or to any such
contract, each other Party hereto or thereto shall reexecute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and
each such Party forever waives any such defense.
