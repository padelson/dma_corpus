capitalized terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.12.

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and becoming a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has unanimously (i) determined that it is in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors or similar governing body of each of Parent
and Merger Sub have unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it
advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Parent and Merger Sub
to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (as
identified therein, the " _Stockholders_ "), have executed and delivered a
voting agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") with respect to this Agreement;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") is
entering into a limited guaranty in favor of the Company (the " _Guaranty_ ")
pursuant to which the Guarantor is guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent
under this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined
below), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into   the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One
Liberty Plaza, New York, NY 10006 at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), on the
later of (a) a date to be specified by Parent and the Company, which shall be
no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time), and (b) the earlier of (i) a date during the Marketing Period to
be specified by Parent on no fewer than two Business Days notice to the
Company and (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period, unless another date,
time, or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company (the date on
which such Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_
"). 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). At or prior to
consummation of the Merger, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
parties shall make all other filings, recordings or publications required
under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the
DGCL, or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the
Closing Date and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the
Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of the
certificate of incorporation attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , and as so
amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to Section 5.8 hereof).

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly

 



-2-   elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF

CERTIFICATES; COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of Stock
Held by Company Subsidiaries_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be canceled and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to $17.25, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
"), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without
interest.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration, in each
case in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall
prior to the Closing Date enter into an agreement with the Paying

 



-3-   Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay such aggregate Merger Consideration
(for the avoidance of doubt, such amounts shall not include the Equity Award
Amounts). Such aggregate cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending
its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5 billion. Parent shall promptly replace or cause to be replaced any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to
this Section 2.2(a) to the extent required to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Nothing contained in this Section 2.2(a) and no investment
losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent
shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive
the Merger Consideration or any holder of a Company Equity Award to receive
the Equity Award Amount, in each case as provided herein.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be
in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock

 



-4-   previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the
Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g)  _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts any of them
reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_
"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Government Authority, the deducted and withheld

 



-5-   amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who has properly exercised and perfected its, his or her appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor
provision) (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,

shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
Section 2.1, without any interest thereon. The Company shall (i) give Parent
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed,
and consult with Parent, regarding all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, the

make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any
withdrawal of, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing. 

Section 2.4 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions
of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof and amending any Company
Stock Plan) to, subject to consummation of the Merger, terminate the Company
Stock Plans and all awards and obligations of the Company outstanding
thereunder, including to provide that:

 

(i) each unexercised Company Equity Award that is a Stock Option, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and the holder thereof shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right, on the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (I) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Stock Option _multiplied by_ (II) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Stock Option;

 



-6-  (ii) each Company Equity Award that is a SAR, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled, and shall cease to exist and the holder thereof shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto except the right, on the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (I) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such SAR
_multiplied by_ (II) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such SAR; and

(iii) each Company Equity Award that is an RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be
vested and canceled and shall cease to exist and the holder thereof shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto except the right to receive, on
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (x) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (y) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such RSU held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Payment in respect of all Company Equity Awards hereunder shall be subject
to appropriate withholding for Taxes in accordance with Section 2.2(g) and
shall be paid on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter but in all cases not later than the first
payroll date following the date on which the Effective Time occurs. The term
" _Equity Award Amounts_ " means, collectively, all amounts payable pursuant
to this Section 2.4.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Equity Awards
the Equity Award Amounts described in this Section 2.4 as and when required by
this Section 2.4.

 

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

Section 4.4 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub consists of 900 shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, and 100 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of
the date of the Agreement and at the Effective Time, Parent owns beneficially
and of record all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub,
and such capital stock of Merger Sub has been duly authorized and validly
issued, and is fully paid and non-assessable. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has no
assets, liabilities or obligations of any

 



-27-   nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to the
Transactions, and prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any
other business activities other than those relating to the Transactions.

Section 4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed
commitment letter from the Guarantor (the " _Equity Funding Letter_ ") to
invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), (ii) an executed
commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letters from the financial institutions
identified therein (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the
Equity Funding Letter, collectively referred to as the " _Financing Letters_
"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_
") have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the Transactions and related fees (being collectively referred to as
the " _Debt Financing_ ", and together with the Equity Financing, collectively
referred to as the " _Financing_ "). None of the Financing Letters has been
amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement and as of the date of
this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other than
amendments or modifications that are permitted by Section 5.5(a)), and as of
the date of this Agreement the respective obligations and commitments
contained in the Financing Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. Except for fee letters and engagement letters with respect to the
Financing, as of the date hereof, there are no side letters or Contracts to
which Parent or Merger Sub is a party related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Financing that could adversely affect the availability of
the Financing, or which include conditions precedent to the obligations of the
parties thereunder, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters
delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Letters
that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and as of the date hereof the
Financing Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the
case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, each of the other
parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Letters. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other
party thereto under any of the Financing Letters. As of the date hereof,
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters applicable to it will not be
satisfied. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Letters, Parent and Merger Sub, in the aggregate and together with the
available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of the Company,
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration and Equity Award Amounts, (ii) finance the repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or either Financing Letter
and (iii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
Financing and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation contemplated hereunder.

Section 4.6  _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The Guaranty
is in full force and effect

 



-28-   and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Guarantor subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and no event has occurred, which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of Guarantor under such Guaranty.

Section 4.7 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) Company and its Subsidiaries are Solvent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, (c) any
repayment or refinancing of debt as contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Letters, (d) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Article III hereof and the performance of the Company
of its obligations hereunder, (e) any estimates, projections or forecasts of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable when made, (f) payment of
all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, and (g) payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent as of the
Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (i) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, exceed the sum of (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the liabilities of
such Person on its existing debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute
and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged , and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

Section 4.8 _Certain Arrangements_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no Contracts or commitments to enter into any such Contracts to which
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates is party (a) pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of
a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or, other than the
Voting Agreement, pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to
vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote against
any Superior Proposal or (b) pursuant to which any current employee of the
Company has agreed to (i) remain as an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time at compensation levels in excess of
levels currently in effect (other than pursuant to any Company Plans or
Contracts with the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date
hereof, and the assumption by the Surviving Corporation of any such
arrangements as contemplated by Section 5.9(c) of this Agreement), (ii)
contribute any portion of such employees shares, Company Equity Awards or
other equity awards to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Affiliates or (iii) receive any capital stock or equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 



-29-  Section 4.9 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, finder, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any, whose fees and
expenses will be paid by Parent.

Section 4.10 _Independent Review; Non-Reliance_. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that it has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the
business, assets, condition and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. In connection with entering into this Agreement, Parent has
relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the representations
and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained in this
Agreement. In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company
by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have received and may continue
to receive from the Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan
information, regarding the Company and its business and operations. Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Parent and
Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,
as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans).

 

Section 4.11 _Proxy Statement_. The information supplied or to be supplied in
writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement to be sent to the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders

reference) shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

Section 4.12 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no (a)
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened Action against Parent or
Merger Sub or (b) any Order imposed upon Parent or Merger Sub, in each case,
by or before any Governmental Authority, that seeks to enjoin, or would
reasonably be likely to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or
otherwise interfering with, any of the Transactions, except as would not
reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 4.13 _Full Access_. Parent acknowledges that, to its Knowledge, it and
the Purchaser Representatives have received access to substantially all such
books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that it and the Purchaser Representatives have
requested to review, and that it and the Purchaser 

 



-30-   Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company to discuss the businesses and assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.14 _Interests in Competitors_. As of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub owns any interest(s) in any entity or Person that derives a
substantial portion of its revenues from a line of business within the
Companys principal lines of business.

representations and warranties expressly made by Parent and Merger Sub in this

Confidentiality Agreement that is in full force and effect ( _provided_ that
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was
not previously provided to Parent or Parents Representatives) and (ii) the
Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person making such Acquisition Proposal with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, prior to taking
any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, (A) the Board of Directors,
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; (B) the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee, has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal; and (C) the Company shall have given written
notice to Parent promptly after any such determination described in the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B).

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after
receipt), notify the Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiries relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
any request for information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated
or continued with, either the Company or its Representatives concerning an
Acquisition Proposal. The Companys notice shall include (i) a copy of any
Acquisition Proposal made in writing and other written materials provided to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) a written summary of the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, including
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) of
the status or any developments regarding any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request, including any modification or amendment to any such Acquisition
Proposal. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any
agreement that would prohibit them from providing such information to Parent.

(e) Except as and to the extent expressly permitted herein, the Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) will not (i) (A) change, qualify,

(a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), (B) cause or permit the Company to enter
into any letter of intent or similar arrangement or any acquisition agreement,
merger agreement

 



-36-   or similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) which contemplates any Acquisition Proposal (any such definitive

Acquisition Agreement_ "), (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company, an Acquisition
Proposal or (D) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital
stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced,
fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by
the Company stockholders (including, for these purposes, by taking
no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer by its stockholders, which shall constitute a failure to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten (10)
Business Days after commencement thereof, (ii) terminate, amend, waive, or
exempt any Person or group from, the restrictions contained in any standstill
agreements, the Company Rights Agreement or any state takeover statute or
similar Law or otherwise cause any such restrictions therein not to apply or
(iii) resolve or agree to any of the foregoing.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the time, but
not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Board of
Directors may make a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and the Board of Directors shall
not effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or take any action permitted by Section 7.3(a) with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal unless (i) the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, that the relevant Acquisition Proposal was an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal received by the Company in compliance with
Section 5.2(c) and constitutes a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to
all of the offered adjustments to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing
Letters, the Guaranty and the Voting Agreement referred to in clause (iv)
below), (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with this Section 5.2, (iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing,
at least three (3) Business Days in advance of making or effecting a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or taking any action
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice
shall specify the identity of the party who made such Superior Proposal and
all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach
the most current version of such Superior Proposal, (iv) after providing such
notice and prior to making such Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or taking any action pursuant to Section 7.3(a) with
respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent during such three (3)
Business Day period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Board of
Directors not to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal or to take such action pursuant to Section 7.3(a) in
response to a Superior Proposal and (v) the Board of Directors shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters,
the Guaranty and the Voting Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner
that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall have
determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were to be given effect; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in

 



-37-   connection with a Superior Proposal or take any action pursuant to Section
7.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal prior to the time that is three (3)
Business Days after it has provided the written notice required by clause
(ii) above; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that the Acquisition
Proposal is thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company shall provide written notice of such modified Acquisition
Proposal and shall again comply with this Section 5.2(f), except that the
notice period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days (rather than the three
(3) Business Days otherwise contemplated by this Section 5.2(f)) and the time
the Company shall be permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or to take action pursuant to Section
7.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal shall be reduced to the time that
is two (2) Business Days after it has provided such written notice (rather
than the time that is three (3) Business Days otherwise contemplated by this
Section 5.2(f)).

 

(g) As used in this Agreement,

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer with respect
to: (A) any purchase of an equity interest (including by means of a tender or
exchange offer) representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the voting
power in the Company; (B) a merger, consolidation, other business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving the Company; or (C) any purchase of assets, businesses,
securities or ownership interests in the Company and its Subsidiaries
representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the consolidated assets of the
Company; in each case, other than the Transactions.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition
thereof deemed to be "fifty percent (50%)" for the purposes of this
definition) made by any Person on terms that the Board of Directors or the
Special Committee, determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, after considering such
factors as the Board of Directors or the Special Committee, considers to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
success of such Acquisition Proposal), are more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions (taking into
account any revised proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement,
the Financing Letters, the Guaranty and the Voting Agreement pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 5.2(f) above), (B) provides for financing that is
reasonably likely to be obtained and (C) is reasonably expected to be
consummated on a timely basis.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); _provided_ that
any disclosure other than a "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the
Company) shall be deemed a Change in Recommendation unless accompanied or
reasonably promptly followed by an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal or an express

 



-38-   affirmation of the Company Board Recommendation or (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare the Proxy Statement
and file it with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from
the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the resolution of any such comments. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company in
connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including
promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all
information relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the
Proxy Statement under applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such
information supplied by it in writing specifically for inclusion (or
incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is
first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated
above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement, or filing any other
required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, to the extent
practicable, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and shall consider
Parents comments in good faith. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy
Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading. The Company assumes
no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) The Company shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, the
Company Charter Documents and the rules of NASDAQ to set a record date for,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC
confirms that it

 



-39-   has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.2 and
Section 7.3, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company in its sole discretion may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or if as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Article VII, the Company shall submit the Merger and this
Agreement for the approval of its stockholder at the Company Stockholder
Meeting, whether or not a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred or an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made
known to the Company, the Board of Directors, its Representatives or its
Stockholders.

 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Laws_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as soon as practicable and to consummate
and make effective as promptly as practicable, the Transactions, including
(i) preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all
necessary registrations, notices and forms and other documents, (ii) obtaining
all approvals, consents, waivers and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions, (iii) executing and delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and (iv) defending or
contesting any Action or other proceeding brought by a third party that would
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting subsection (a) above, each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the
date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act and to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly take any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain
all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or
U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with
competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions.
The Company and Parent shall each request early termination of the waiting
period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. No party shall, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any
business, Person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to
or the consummation of such acquisition would reasonably be expected to
materially increase the risk of not obtaining the 

 



-40-   applicable clearance, approval, consent or waiver from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust
Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all applicable foreign
antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private Person, (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions, (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other
party with respect to information relating to the other parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third Person and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, and (iv) to the
extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental
Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

Section 5.5 _Financing_.

(a)(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the
Financing Letters pursuant to the terms thereof, and shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under,
the Financing Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) reduces
(or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made
available to fund such fees or original issue discount and (y) after giving
effect to any of the transactions referred to in clause (x) above, the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.7 shall be true and
correct) or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of Financing, or
otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing
Letters, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or
prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact
the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company
copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement ( _provided_ that
the Parent and Merger Sub may

 



-41-   amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof). 

(ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (A)
to maintain in effect the Financing Letters, (B) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than
the terms and conditions (including flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment
Letter), (C) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions to receipt of the Debt
Financing at the Closing set forth therein that are within its control or
subject to its influence (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish information
described in Section 5.5(b)) and in the Equity Funding Letter and, upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters, to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its
reasonable best efforts (including, other than with respect to the providers
of the Equity Financing, through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause
the Lenders and the other persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the
Financing at the Closing, (D) to enforce its rights (including, other than
with respect to the providers of the Equity Financing, through litigation
pursued in good faith) under the Financing Letters and (E) to comply with its
obligations under the Financing Letters. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company copies of
drafts and definitive agreements for the Debt Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of
which Parent or Merger Sub become aware and (y) of the receipt of any written
notice from any Financing Source with respect to any actual breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing. If any
portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion
is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration and all
fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates) than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all Contracts (including Redacted Fee
Letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative
financing, is not a condition to Closing. For purposes of this Section 5.5
and Section 4.5, references to "Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted by this
Section 5.5 to be amended, modified or

 



-42-   replaced and references to "Financing Letters" shall include such documents
as permitted by this Section 5.5 to be amended, modified or replaced, in each
case from and after such amendment, modification and replacement.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger
Sub, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and
accounting, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified
or alternative financing (collectively with the Financing, the " _Available
Financing_ ") ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) (A) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their
Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable following Parents
request, with such pertinent and customary information (other than financial
information, which is covered by clause (ii) below), to the extent reasonably
available to the Company, regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested in writing by Parent to consummate the offerings of debt
securities contemplated by the Available Financing at the time during the
Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made and (B) furnishing Parent
and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following Parents request, with information (other than financial
information, which is covered by clause (ii) below) regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including information to be used in the preparation of one
or more information packages regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries) customary for
the arrangement of loans contemplated by the Available Financing (the " _Bank
Financing_ "), to the extent reasonably available to the Company and
reasonably requested in writing by Parent to assist in preparation of
customary offering or information documents or rating agency or lender
presentations relating to such arrangement of loans, and including all
information and data necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in
paragraphs 5, 6, and 9 of the Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter (other
than financial information, which is covered by clause (ii) below), (ii)

practicable all financial statements, pro forma financial statements and other

this Agreement), including all financial statements and financial and other
data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act for registered offerings of debt securities, and of the
type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (including pro forma
financial information), and other documents required to satisfy any customary
negative assurance opinion, to consummate the Financing at the time the
Financing is to be consummated, including all information and data necessary
to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 5, 6 and 9 of the Exhibit D
of the Debt Commitment Letter (the information, data, financial statements,
pro forma financial statements, business and other financial data and
financial information referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) herein shall mean
the " _Required Information_ "), (iii) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as
lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders
and purchasers of, the Available Financing and senior management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, and reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of the Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources, in each case
in connection with the

any of its Subsidiaries, and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any rating agency

and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or

agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 5.6 shall limit the rights of the Company or the rights of the Board
of Directors under Section 5.2 or in announcing any Change of Recommendation
or acceptance of a Superior Proposal made in accordance with Section 5.2(f)
and Section 7.3(a).

such undertakings), access during normal business hours to the Companys
employees, properties, books, Contracts and records as Parent may reasonably
request and during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning their
respective businesses, properties and personnel as may be reasonably
requested; _provided_ that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt or
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
the Companys employees of their normal duties. All requests for such access
shall be made to the representatives of RBC Capital Markets, LLC and Moelis and
Company LLC identified to Parent or such other agents of the Company as the
Company may, acting through its chairman or chief executive officer,
designate, who will be responsible for coordinating all such requests and all
access permitted hereunder. During the period from the date of this Agreement
until the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, neither
Parent, Merger Sub nor any of the respective Purchaser Representatives shall
contact any of the customers, landlords, licensors or suppliers of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions, whether in
person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the
specific prior authorization of the Chairman of the

 



-45-   Board of Directors or such agents of the Company as the Company may
designate, such authorization not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required
to afford access or disclose information that would, in the judgment of the
Company, jeopardize attorney client privilege, contravene any binding
agreement with any third party or violate any Law or regulation. The parties
will make reasonable appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances
where the previous sentence applies.

(b) Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the
terms of the confidentiality agreement dated as of January 12, 2011, by and
between the Company and Warburg Pincus LLC (as may be amended from time to
time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall (and, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements (the " _Indemnity Agreements_ ") between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors and officers and any Person who becomes a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ "). The Company
has made available to Parent true and correct copies of all Indemnity
Agreements. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall cause (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), for a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by Law, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of the date of
this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee with respect to all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on
or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions
by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), in each case to the
same extent that such persons are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiary
as currently in effect, and (ii) assume all obligations of the

 



-46-   Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company
Charter Documents and the organizational documents of each Subsidiary as
currently in effect. In addition, from the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any
Indemnitee under this Section 5.8 (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.8) as incurred
to the same extent that such persons are entitled to payment of expenses
pursuant to the Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of
such Subsidiary as currently in effect, _provided_ that the individual to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it
shall be determined that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to the Company Charter Documents.

(c) The Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume and control the defense of any threatened or actual
Action relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.8
(each, a " _Claim_ ") unless there is a conflict of interest between Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Indemnitee, on the
other (for the avoidance of doubt, conflict of interest shall be deemed to
exist in the event of any threatened or actual litigation, claim or proceeding
relating to the Transactions); _provided_ , that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any such Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(d) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued
by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail"
policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or the
Surviving Corporation expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance. Subject to the foregoing limitation on expense and
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), the Company may, prior to the Effective Time,
purchase a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering

 



-47-   without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been
obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.8(d) and the Surviving
Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of
its obligations thereunder.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.8 applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this Section 5.8.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Section 5.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Except as specifically otherwise noted in Section 5.9(c) below, or, in
respect of employees represented by unions, as otherwise provided in the
applicable collective bargaining agreement or negotiated with the applicable
unions that represent any such employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided, to those employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who are actively employed as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") with annual
base salary and base wages, short-term cash incentive compensation
opportunities and benefits (excluding equity-based compensation), that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to such annual base salary and
base wages, short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits
(excluding equity-based compensation) provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from
terminating the employment of any Company Employee and any obligation of the
Surviving Corporation to a Company Employee pursuant to this Section 5.9(a)
shall immediately cease upon a Company Employees termination of employment,
subject to the conditions of any

 



-48-   employment arrangement currently in place with such Company Employee under a
Company Plan.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans, to the
extent this credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service), under any employee compensation and incentive plans,
benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements
maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective
Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company
Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities (each, a " _New Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each New Plan that is
a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, regardless as
to whether or not such New Plan is subject to ERISA), Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations for each Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will honor and perform (i) their legally binding obligations
under existing Company Plans that are employment, change in control, severance
and termination protection plans or agreements of or between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company,
and any bonus plan, program or agreement other than a Company Stock Plan and
(ii) their legally binding obligations pursuant to Company Plans that are
restoration, equity-based, bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or
agreements and in respect of vested and accrued benefits under any such
Company Plans, in each of the foregoing cases referenced in clauses (i) and
(ii) above, to the extent legally binding on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and outstanding immediately prior to the date hereof, subject to
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries to
amend or terminate any such plans, programs, agreements or arrangements in
accordance with their terms from and after the Effective Time.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.9 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or restrict the rights or ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any of
the foregoing in accordance with its terms for purposes of ERISA or
otherwise. No current or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
the Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation_.
Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, of any (i) notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions or from any Person

 



-49-   alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent; (ii) Actions commenced or, to
the Companys Knowledge on the one hand and Parents knowledge, on the other
hand, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries, which relate to this Agreement and the
Transactions and (iii) occurrence or nonoccurrence of any change, effect,
event, change in circumstance, occurrence known to such Person or discovery
or any fact, that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions
to Closing set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied; _provided_ that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, settle, agree to settle or offer to settle any such
stockholder litigation.

Section 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

Section 5.12 _Takeover Statutes_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each (x) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to any of the Transactions and (y) if the restrictions of any state takeover
statute or similar Law become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions. 

Section 5.13 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, other than with
respect to any directors identified by Parent in writing to the Company two
(2) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent resignations executed by each director of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time.

this Agreement.

Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228
of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a
written consent adopting this Agreement.

agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated (which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be the same
Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B)), or the Board of Directors shall
have recommended to the Companys stockholders an Acquisition Proposal
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
described in clause (B)) ( _provided_ that for purposes of clause (C), the

consummation or execution of such agreement, whichever is earliest, the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b), then no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of

transfer; or

then immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination
the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer;

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to $16,920,000.

In the event that Parent or its designee shall receive full payment pursuant
to this Section 7.5(a) together with reimbursement of any applicable expenses
pursuant to Section 7.5(d), the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), 

 



-55-   the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company
Related Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.5(a) shall limit the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 8.8.

(b) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 7.3(b) or 7.3(c), then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination
fee of $33,840,000 in cash in immediately available funds (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the
event that Company shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section
7.5(b), together with any required reimbursement and indemnification pursuant
to Section 5.5(b) or reimbursement of any applicable expenses pursuant to
Section 7.5(d), the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee together with such
expenses shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Guaranty (and the
termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither the
Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim,
action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related
Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Financing
Letters or the Guaranty, any of the Transactions (or the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that any claim, action or proceeding is commenced or instituted by the
Company in respect of the Parent Termination Fee and/or a claim for specific
performance of Parents and Merger Subs obligations in accordance with
Section 8.8, during the pendency of such proceeding and, if a court of
competent jurisdiction has ordered Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee
and/or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, until
five (5) Business Days following such order, Parent may at any time notify
the Company in writing that it will consummate the Closing within ten (10)
Business Days following such notice, in which case Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall consummate the Closing and the Company shall not be permitted
or entitled to enforce such order during such ten (10) -Business Day period
(and, if the Closing is not consummated, the Company shall be entitled to
continue to pursue such claim, action or proceeding or to enforce such order,
as applicable, following such ten (10) -Business Day period). For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the Company shall not seek to
enforce any such order for payment of the Parent Termination Fee in the event
the Closing is consummated. 

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.5 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.5, and, in order to obtain the
payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences an Action which
results in a judgment against the other party, with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub, or parties, with respect 

 



-56-   to the Company for the payment set forth in this Section 7.5, such paying
party shall pay the other party or parties, as applicable, its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to the Companys rights set forth in Section 8.8 and the required
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 5.5(b)
hereof, the Companys and its Affiliates rights to terminate this Agreement
and receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the Guarantor
pursuant to the Guaranty in respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and stockholders against
Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor and any of their respective former,
current, or future direct or indirect general or limited partners,
equityholders, stockholders, controlling persons, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, Financing Sources,
portfolio companies, attorneys and other Representatives, and their

indirect general or limited partners, equityholders,
stockholders, controlling persons, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, financing sources, portfolio companies,
attorneys and other Representatives of any of the foregoing, and their
successors, assignees and agents (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,
and upon payment of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Except as expressly provided in the immediately
foregoing sentence, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any
liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Guaranty (except, for the avoidance of doubt, for the
Guarantors obligation under the Guaranty, subject to the limitations
contained therein), the Debt Financing or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, (i)
under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in
excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and any required
reimbursement and indemnification pursuant to Section 5.5(b)) or to seek or
obtain any other damages of any kind against the Financing Sources of the Debt
Financing, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for,
or with respect to, this Agreement or the Transactions and (ii) while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
Section 8.8 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section
7.5(b), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance and any money damages, including
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. Upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any
further liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Guaranty, the Financing Commitments or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability to the
Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



-57-  (f) None of the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or
Affiliates, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ "), will have any liability to the Parent Related
Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement (except in the case of
the Voting Agreement, the parties thereto).

agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement and (b) nothing
contained herein shall restrict Parent from converting

party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their

herein, Sections 7.5(e), 8.7(b), 8.9 and this Section 8.6 (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of Section 7.5(e), 8.7(b), 8.9 or this

impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources of the Debt
Financing without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources of the

Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

(b) All Actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
located in Wilmington, 

 



-59-   Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington,
Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
located in Wilmington, Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such
Action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
Action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this
Section 8.7(b) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in
the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of
process upon such party in any Action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight
courier at the address set forth in Section 8.10 of this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights
to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final
trial court judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind of description, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources of the Debt Financing in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan,
or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and appellate courts thereof).

Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Section 8.8, including the limitations set forth in Section
8.8(b), it is agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article VII, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded and to consummate the Merger only in the event that each of
the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to this Agreement, including Section 1.2,
(ii) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with Section 5.5, such alternative financing) has been funded or
will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing
and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice delivered
to Parent and the Financing Sources that if specific performance is granted
and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or alternative financing, to

 



-60-   the extent described above) are funded, the Company stands ready, willing
and able for the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
Parents or Merger Subs right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or
to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing (or alternative financing, to the
extent described above) has not been funded (or will not be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In no event shall
the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and
as specifically set forth in this Section 8.8(b). For the avoidance of doubt,
while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only
to the extent expressly permitted by this Section 8.8(b) and the payment of
the Parent Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by Section
7.5), under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to both
specifically perform the terms of this Agreement and pay the Parent
Termination Fee.

 

(c) The right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions
and each party hereto hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of such party under this Agreement all in accordance with the
terms of this Section 8.8. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction all in
accordance with the terms of this Section 8.8. 

Section 8.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT

illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law (a) such
provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never

provision as may be possible; _provided_ that the parties intend that the

Fee or the Parent Termination Fee be the exclusive remedy for the recipient
thereof and certain related parties as provided under Section 7.5, except for
the right of the parties to seek specific performance in accordance with, and
only to the extent permitted by, Section 8.8) contained in Article VIII to be
construed as an integral provision of this Agreement

that increases a partys liability or obligations hereunder or under the
Financing Letters or the Guaranty.
