owned by such Stockholders in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be issued and paid, as applicable, to
such Stockholders.

  



  

(d)  _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

  



  

(i) Each Company Stock Option (including any Underwater Options) held by an
Optionholder that is outstanding immediately prior to the Transaction
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be deemed
cancelled at and as of the Closing pursuant to the terms of the applicable
option award agreement and the Equity Incentive Plan, and in exchange
therefor, the Optionholder that holds such Company Stock Option shall be
entitled to receive the amounts (if any) set forth in _clauses (ii)_ and

(B) an amount of Holdco Shares equal to (less any reduction of Holdco Shares
to satisfy any Required Withholding Amounts with respect to such
Optionholder) the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (1) an amount equal to the
product of (x) an amount equal to (I) the Per Share Closing Date Merger
Consideration, _minus_ (II) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock of such Company Stock Options, and (y) the Stock Percentage, _by_ (2)

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Aggregate Per Share Closing Date
Merger Consideration is less than or equal to the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock for any of the Company Stock Options, such Company Stock
Options shall be deemed to have been cancelled and no longer outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing, and the Optionholder that owns such Company
Stock Options shall receive no distributions in respect of such Company Stock
Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Aggregate Per Share Closing Date
Merger Consideration shall be re-calculated excluding the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock for such Company Stock Options and the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock
Options from such calculation, and such re-calculation shall be repeated
until there are no Company Stock Options for which the Aggregate Per Share
Closing Date Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock for such Company Stock Options (such Company Stock
Options, collectively, " _Underwater Options_ ").

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, amounts paid pursuant to this _Section
1.5(d)(ii)_ shall be included within, and not in addition to, the Closing
Date Merger Consideration.

  



  

(iii) Following the Transaction Effective Time, each Optionholder that is a
Participating Optionholder shall also have the right to receive (subject to
the provisions of _Section 1.5(e)_ , _Section 1.10_ , _Section 1.12_ and
_Section 1.15_ ), from time to time, (x) such Participating Optionholder's
Pro Rata Share of any Additional Merger Consideration distributed to the
Sellers, _minus_ (y) any applicable Required Withholding Amounts with respect
to such Participating Optionholder.

    



  

(e)  _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(i) As soon as practicable after the Closing, but not later than forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date, Surviving Pubco shall deliver to the
Representative and the Escrow Agent a statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_
") showing, in reasonable detail, Surviving Pubco's calculation of (A) the
Closing Date Debt Amount (the " _Calculated Closing Date Debt Amount_ ") and
(B) the Closing Date Working Capital (the " _Calculated Closing Date Working
Capital_ "), in each case as determined in accordance with this Agreement.
For purposes of preparing the Adjustment Statement, no effect shall be given
to any new accounting pronouncements that may be issued following the Closing
Date. After the date that Surviving Pubco delivers the Adjustment
Statement to the Representative and until the completion of the Final
Statement, Surviving Pubco shall (and Surviving Pubco shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) provide the Representative and any
accountants (and/or other representatives) of the Representative with access
to (and the right to examine and make copies of), at all reasonable times, the
properties, books, work papers, records and materials of the Surviving
Company, each of its Subsidiaries, Surviving Pubco and its accountants
(including, without limitation, all supporting schedules and other materials
that show the calculation of each component of the Calculated Closing Date
Working Capital and the Calculated Closing Date Debt Amount), and personnel of
Surviving Pubco, the Surviving Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (and
Surviving Pubco shall cause such personnel to cooperate and work in good faith
with the Representative), for purposes of reviewing the Adjustment Statement,
disputing the Adjustment Statement and/or agreeing upon a Final
Statement. Surviving Pubco shall provide such access to the Representative
(and/or any accountants or other representatives of the
Representative), including, at the Representative's election, by providing to
the Representative copies of any books, records, materials and/or work papers
requested by the Representative, within two (2) Business Days after the
Representative delivers a request to Surviving Pubco for such access, and if
such access is not provided to the Representative (and/or any accountants or
other representatives of the Representative) within such two (2)-Business Day
period, then the 45-day period referred to in _Section 1.5(e)(ii) _ shall be
extended by the number of days it takes Surviving Pubco to provide such access
in excess of such two (2)-Business Day period.

--- 

    



  

(ii) If the Representative disagrees with any aspect of the Adjustment
Statement, the Representative shall notify Surviving Pubco of such
disagreement in writing (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") specifying any and all items
of disagreement (each, an " _Item of Dispute_ ") within forty-five (45) days
after the Representative's receipt of the Adjustment Statement. The
Representative and Surviving Pubco shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts for a period of fifteen (15) Business Days after the
Representative's delivery of a Dispute Notice (or such longer period as the
Parties may mutually agree upon) to resolve all Items of Dispute. If, at the
end of such 15-Business Day period, the Representative and Surviving Pubco do
not resolve any such Item of Dispute, the Representative and Surviving Pubco
shall submit such unresolved Item of Dispute to a mutually acceptable
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing to review and
resolve each such unresolved Item of Dispute. In the event the
Representative and Surviving Pubco cannot agree upon an accounting firm
within five (5) Business Days after the end of such 15-Business Day
period (or if an accounting firm does not accept the engagement and the
Representative and Surviving Pubco cannot agree upon a replacement accounting
firm within five (5) Business Days after the accounting firm notifies the
Representative and Surviving Pubco that it will not accept the engagement),
the Representative and Surviving Pubco shall each submit to their respective
accountants the name of an accounting firm (which shall not be either of
their respective accounting firms or any other accounting firm which had a
material relationship with either the Company or Parent), and the accounting
firm shall be selected by lot from these two firms by the respective
accountants of the Representative and Surviving Pubco (the accounting firm
selected in accordance with the preceding two sentences is referred to herein
as the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Parties shall request that the Accounting
Firm render a determination on each Item of Dispute. The Accounting Firm,
acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall determine, in accordance with
the Agreed Principles (in the case of the Calculated Closing Date Working
Capital) and/or the other applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement,
and only with respect to the remaining unresolved Items of Dispute, whether
and to what extent, if any, the Adjustment Statement requires adjustment. In
resolving any Item of Dispute, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to
any item, calculation or other matter greater than the greatest value for such
item, calculation or other matter claimed by Surviving Pubco or the
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item, calculation
or other matter claimed by Surviving Pubco or the Representative, in either
case in the Adjustment Statement or the Dispute Notice. The determination by
the Accounting Firm shall be set forth in a written statement with a
reasonably detailed explanation for such determination, and shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties and the Sellers absent fraud, bad faith
or manifest error. Any fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Surviving Pubco.

  



  

(iii) The " _Final Statement_ " shall be deemed to be (A) the Adjustment
Statement if no Dispute Notice is delivered by the Representative within the
45-day period specified in _Section 1.5(e)(ii)_ (as such period may be
extended pursuant to _Section 1.5(e)(i)_ ), (B) the Adjustment Statement if
the Representative notifies Surviving Pubco in writing that the
Representative agrees with the Adjustment Statement in its entirety at any
time during the 45-day period specified in _Section 1.5(e)(ii)_ (as such
period may be extended pursuant to _Section 1.5(e)(i)_ ), or (C) if a Dispute
Notice is delivered by the Representative within the 45-day period specified
in _Section 1.5(e)(ii)_ (as such period may be extended pursuant to _Section
1.5(e)(i)_ ), the Adjustment Statement as adjusted by (x) the written
agreement of the Representative and Surviving Pubco and/or (y) the written
statement of the Accounting Firm. The Final Statement shall be final and
binding on the Surviving Pubco, the Surviving Company, the Representative and
the Sellers.

(iv) Within five (5) Business Days after the date that the Adjustment
Statement becomes the Final Statement in accordance with
_Section 1.5(e)(iii)_ , the Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted (if required) as follows:

  



  

(A) if the Working Capital Adjustment Amount is greater than zero (0), then
the Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be adjusted upward in an amount
equal to the Working Capital Adjustment Amount;

  



  

(B) if the Working Capital Adjustment Amount is less than zero (0), then the
Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be adjusted downward in an amount
equal to the Working Capital Adjustment Amount;

  



  

(C) if the Calculated Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth in the Final
Statement is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth
in the Closing Statement, then the Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted downward in an amount equal to the difference between the Calculated
Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth in the Final Statement and the
Estimated Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement; and

  



  

(D) if the Estimated Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth in the Closing
Statement is greater than the Calculated Closing Date Debt Amount as set
forth in the Final Statement, then the Closing Date Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted upward in an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated
Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth in the Closing Statement and the
Calculated Closing Date Debt Amount as set forth in the Final Statement.

  



  

All adjustments set forth in this _Section 1.5(e)(iv)_ shall be netted
against each other. The date the Closing Date Merger Consideration is
adjusted as set forth above in this _Section 1.5(e)(iv)_ is referred to herein
as the " _Final Determination Date_ ".

(v) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Closing Date Merger
Consideration (such difference, the " _Positive Amount_ "), then, Surviving
Pubco shall pay the Positive Amount in cash as follows: (A) a portion of the
Positive Amount equal to the aggregate amount of Bonus Payments owed to the
Bonus Payment Recipients pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plan and the Bonus
Award Agreements on account of the payment of the Positive Amount (such
amount, the " _Bonus Payment Recipient Positive Amount_ " and the remaining
portion of the Positive Amount, the " _Sellers Positive Amount_ ") shall be
paid to the Bonus Payment Recipients ( _provided_ , that the portion of the
Bonus Payment Recipient Positive Amount actually paid to any Bonus Payment
Recipient shall be net of the Required Withholding Amounts with respect to
such Bonus Payment Recipient), (B) a portion of the Sellers Positive Amount
equal to the product of (1) the Sellers Positive Amount and (2) the aggregate
Pro Rata Shares of the Stockholders shall be paid to the Exchange Agent, as
agent for the Stockholders, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
in accordance with the wire transfer instructions for the Exchange Agent set
forth in the Exchange Agent Agreement, and the Exchange Agent will promptly
distribute such amount to the Stockholders such that the Stockholders receive
their respective Pro Rata Shares of the Sellers Positive Amount ( _provided_
, that Parent shall pay directly to any Specified Stockholder such Specified
Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of the Sellers Positive Amount), and (C) each of
the Participating Optionholders shall be paid a portion of the Sellers
Positive Amount equal to the product of (1) the Sellers Positive Amount and
(2) such Optionholder's Pro Rata Share ( _provided_ , that the portion of the
Sellers Positive Amount actually paid to any Participating Optionholder shall
be net of the Required Withholding Amounts with respect to such Participating
Optionholder). Surviving Pubco, the Surviving Company and their respective
Subsidiaries shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the
Positive Amount required to be made by Surviving Pubco pursuant to this
_Section 1.5(e)(v)_. In addition, if the Final Merger Consideration
exceeds the Closing Date Merger Consideration, the Representative and
Surviving Pubco shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint letter
instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly pay the Adjustment Escrow Cash to the
Exchange Agent (for further distribution to the Stockholders (other than the
Specified Stockholders)), to the Specified Stockholders and to the Surviving
Company (for further distribution to the Participating Optionholders and the
Bonus Payment Recipients), all in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment
Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(vi) If the Closing Date Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration, the Representative and Surviving Pubco shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint letter instructing the Escrow Agent to
promptly pay, in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow
Agreement, the amount of such difference (the " _Negative Amount_ ") to
Surviving Pubco from the Adjustment Escrow Account, and Surviving Pubco shall
not be entitled to receive any portion of the Negative Amount that exceeds
the Adjustment Escrow Cash. In no event shall Surviving Pubco be entitled to
receive all or any portion of the Negative Amount from the Representative,
any of the Sellers or any of the Bonus Payment Recipients, or to bring or
pursue any claim directly or personally against the Representative, any of
the Sellers or any of the Bonus Payment Recipients in respect of all or any
portion of the Negative Amount. If the Adjustment Escrow Cash exceeds the
Negative Amount, the Representative and Surviving Pubco shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint letter instructing the Escrow Agent to
promptly pay the difference between the Adjustment Escrow Cash and the
Negative Amount to the Exchange Agent (for further distribution to the
Stockholders (other than the Specified Stockholders)), to the Specified
Stockholders and to the Surviving Company (for further distribution to the
Participating Optionholders and the Bonus Payment Recipients), all in
accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement.

(vii) All payments and delivery of joint letters to the Escrow Agent required
to be made pursuant to _Section 1.5(e)(v)_ and _Section 1.5(e)(vi)_ shall be

 _(f) Cancellation of Treasury and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each share of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Holdco, the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to
the Transaction Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without
any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

  



  

(g)  _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The number of Holdco Shares issuable
pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Holdco Shares or ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent
(" _Parent Ordinary Shares_ ")), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Holdco Shares or Parent Ordinary
Shares occurring on or after the date hereof but at or prior to the
Transaction Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section 1.5(g)_ shall amend,
change, supersede or otherwise alter the obligations of Parent, Holdco and
Merger Sub under _Section 4.2_.

  



  

(h)  _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Holdco Share will be issued by
virtue of the Mergers, and each holder of Parent Ordinary Shares or shares of
Company Common Stock, each Participating Optionholder and each Bonus Payment
Recipient who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Holdco Share any
time Holdco Shares are distributed to any such Person pursuant to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreements (after aggregating all fractional Holdco
Shares that otherwise would be received by such holder in connection with
such distribution) shall, upon compliance with _Section 1.6_ (in the case of
the Stockholders), receive from Holdco, in lieu of such fractional share, one
(1) Holdco Share.

  



  

1.6  _Merger Consideration Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a reputable bank or
trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company
to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the distribution of
the Merger Consideration to be distributed in the Transaction Merger to the
Stockholders pursuant to an exchange agent agreement in form and
substance mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ "). It is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Company that
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ ") is acceptable
as Exchange Agent.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Transaction Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent and Surviving Pubco shall deliver to each Stockholder a
letter of transmittal (and any instructions related thereto) in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Surviving Pubco and the Company (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") to be completed and executed by such
Stockholder to receive such Stockholder's portion of the Merger Consideration
to which such Stockholder is entitled to receive as contemplated by _Section
1.5_. The Letter of Transmittal will contain, among other things, (i)
customary representations of each Stockholder relating to (as applicable for
Stockholders that are individuals) existence, power and authority, due
authorization, due execution, enforceability and ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Stockholder, (ii) the appointment of the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) an agreement to be bound by
the indemnification provisions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof and (iv) a
general release of claims by each Stockholder in favor of the Released Parties
on the same terms as set forth in _Section 10.15_ (it being understood and
agreed that such release is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and is a material inducement to Parent's, Holdco's and
Merger Sub's entering into this Agreement, and is being provided by each such
Stockholder in consideration for the substantial direct and indirect benefits
to be received by such Stockholder as a result of such transactions). Upon
delivery to the Exchange Agent of a validly executed and delivered Letter of
Transmittal, the Exchange Agent shall (x) issue to the applicable Stockholder
(or its designee) the number of Holdco Shares to which such Stockholder is
entitled under _Section 1.5(c)(ii)_ , (y) distribute to the applicable
Stockholder (or its designee) an amount of cash to which such Stockholder is
entitled under _Section 1.5(c)(i)_ and (z) if the adjustments provided for
therein have been fully completed by such date, an amount of cash to which
such Stockholder is entitled to receive under _Section 1.5(e)_ (it being
understood and agreed that such Stockholder shall also be entitled to receive
all other Additional Merger Consideration to which it is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)(iii)_ hereof at the times set forth herein).

  



  

(c) If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of a Stockholder is to be
made to a recipient other than the Person in whose name shares of Company
Common Stock are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Person requesting such payment must provide funds for payment of any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such shares of Company Common Stock or establish to the
satisfaction of Surviving Pubco that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

  



  

(d) On the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Pubco shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to the Surviving
Pubco any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange
Agent by Holdco that remains undistributed to the Stockholders pursuant to
instructions provided to the Exchange Agent by the Surviving Pubco at such
time, unless required otherwise by applicable Legal Requirements. Thereafter,
any Stockholders who have not complied with the provisions of this
Agreement for receiving their portion of the Merger Consideration from the
Exchange Agent shall look only to the Surviving Pubco for such amounts,
without any interest or dividends thereon.

  



  

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any Stockholder that has
properly completed, executed and delivered to the Exchange Agent a Letter of
Transmittal and all other documentation required by the Letter of Transmittal
prior to or on the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive directly from
Surviving Pubco, and Surviving Pubco shall deliver directly to such
Stockholder (each, a " _Specified Stockholder_ "), in accordance with the
delivery and payment instructions set forth in such Specified Stockholder's
Letter of Transmittal, the portion of the Merger Consideration which such
Specified Stockholder is entitled to receive.

1.7  _No Distributions Until Delivery of Letter of Transmittal_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Holdco Shares with a record date on or after the Closing Date will
be paid to Stockholders that have not yet completed, executed and delivered
to the Exchange Agent a Letter of Transmittal until such Stockholder
completes, executes and delivers to the Exchange Agent a Letter of
Transmittal. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, following the
completion, execution and delivery to the Exchange Agent of a Letter of
Transmittal by a Stockholder, Holdco shall promptly deliver to
such Stockholder (or its designee identified in such Letter of Transmittal),
without interest, the Holdco Shares issued in exchange therefor and the
amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date on or
after the Closing Date theretofore paid with respect to Holdco Shares.

  



  

1.8  _[Reserved]_.

  



  

1.9  _Conversion of Parent Securities_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and as more
particularly set out in the Plan of Merger, the following shall occur in the
Redomestication Merger:

  



  

(i) Each Parent Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Redomestication Effective Time will be automatically converted at the
Redomestication Effective Time (subject to _Sections 1.5(g)_ and _1.5(h)_ )
into one Holdco Share and the holders thereof shall cease to have any further
rights as holders of Parent Ordinary Shares. Each certificate that
evidenced Parent Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Redomestication
Effective Time (" _Parent Ordinary Share Certificate_ ") shall entitle the
holder thereof to the applicable number of Holdco Shares into which the Parent
Ordinary Shares evidenced by such Parent Ordinary Share Certificate is
convertible in accordance with this _Section 1.9(a)(i)_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Parent Ordinary Share Certificate owned by holders who
have validly elected to receive a portion of the proceeds held in the Trust
Fund shall entitle the holder thereof to receive only such portion of the
Trust Fund as provided for in Parent's Charter Documents.

  



  

(ii) Each right of Parent that entitles the holder thereof to acquire one-
seventh of one Parent Ordinary Share (each, a " _Parent Right_ " and,
collectively, " _Parent Rights_ ") that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Redomestication Effective Time, will be automatically converted
at the Redomestication Effective Time (subject to _Sections 1.5(g)_ and
_1.5(h)_ ) into one-seventh of one Holdco Share and the holders thereof shall
cease to have any further rights as holders of Parent Rights. Each
certificate that evidenced Parent Rights immediately prior to the
Redomestication Effective Time (a " _Parent Right Certificate_ ") shall
entitle the holder thereof to the applicable number of Holdco Shares into
which the Parent Rights evidenced by such Parent Right Certificate is
convertible in accordance with this _Section 1.9(a)(ii)_.

(iii) Each Parent Ordinary Share and each Parent Right held by Parent,
Holdco, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Redomestication Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without
any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

  



  

1.10  _Escrow Agreements_.

to the sole and exclusive nature of the remedies with respect to Surviving
Claims, as expressly set forth in _Article VII_ ) for amounts (if any) owed to
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , an aggregate of
$4,250,000 of cash to be paid as part of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration Cash (the " _Indemnity Escrow Cash_ ") and 142,857 of the
Holdco Shares to be issued as part of the Closing Date Merger Consideration
Shares (the " _Indemnity Escrow Shares_ " and together with the Indemnity
Escrow Cash, the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") shall be deposited in escrow
(the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "), which, upon release from the Indemnity
Escrow Account, shall be paid to (i) the Bonus Payment Recipients (in an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of Bonus Payments owed to the Bonus
Payment Recipients pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plan and the
Bonus Award Agreements on account of the payment of the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to be released) and (ii) the Sellers (in an amount
equal to the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund to be released less such
portion that is paid to the Bonus Payment Recipients) in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares, in each case, pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing between
Holdco, the Representative, the Committee and Continental (or such other
Person as may be agreed by Holdco and the Representative), as escrow agent ("
_Escrow Agent_ "), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company
and Parent (the " _Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "). For purposes of
_Article VII_ , the Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be deemed to have a value
equal to the Stated Price per share and the amount of any payment made from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund that is in the form of Indemnity Escrow Shares shall
be calculated based on such value per share.

  



  

(b) As the sole and exclusive remedy for amounts (if any) owed to Surviving
Pubco pursuant to _Section 1.5(e)(vi)_ , an aggregate of $2,000,000 in cash
to be paid as part of the Closing Date Merger Consideration Cash (the "
_Adjustment Escrow Cash_ " and, together with the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the
" _Escrow Amount_ ") shall be deposited in escrow (the " _Adjustment Escrow
Account_ " and, together with the Indemnity Escrow Account, the " _Escrow
Accounts_ "), which, upon release from the Adjustment Escrow Account, shall
be paid to (i) the Bonus Payment Recipients (in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of Bonus Payments owed to the Bonus Payment Recipients
pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plan and the Bonus Award Agreements on
account of the payment of the portion of the Adjustment Escrow Cash to be
released) and (ii) the Sellers (in an amount equal to the portion of the
Adjustment Escrow Cash to be released less such portion that is paid to the
Bonus Payment Recipients) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares, in each case, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the escrow
agreement to be entered into at the Closing between Holdco, the
Representative, the Committee and the Escrow Agent, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (the " _Adjustment Escrow

Agreements. In the event of a vacancy in such committee, the board of
directors of Holdco or, after the consummation of the Mergers, a majority of
those Persons who served on Holdco's board of directors immediately prior to
the Closing Date, shall appoint as a successor some other Person who would

Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by the requisite consent of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, each of the Stockholders shall

1.13  _[Reserved]_.

  



  

1.14  _Shares Subject to Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding _Section 1.5_
hereof, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive
Merger Consideration. The holders thereof shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who
becomes entitled to payment for his Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL
shall receive payment therefor from Surviving Company in accordance with the
DGCL, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any shareholder of the Company who
asserts appraisal rights in connection with the Transaction Merger (a "
_Dissenter_ ") shall have failed to establish his entitlement to such rights
as provided in the DGCL, or (ii) if any such Dissenter shall have
effectively withdrawn his demand for payment for his Dissenting Shares or
waived or lost his right to payment for his Dissenting Shares under the
appraisal rights process under the DGCL, the shares of Company Common Stock
held by such Dissenter shall be treated as if they had been converted, as of
the Transaction Effective Time, into a right to receive Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 1.5_. The Company shall give Holdco prompt notice of
any demands for payment received by the Company from a Person
asserting appraisal rights, and Holdco shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except in accordance with the DGCL and with the prior written
consent of Holdco which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands or negotiate or enter into any agreement with
respect to any demands for payment received by the Company from a Person
asserting appraisal rights.

  



  

1.15  _Administrative Expense Account_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Holdco shall pay to the Representative an aggregate of
$1,500,000 in cash to be paid as part of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration Cash (the " _Administrative Expense Amount_ ") and such amount
shall be paid by Holdco by wire transfer of immediately available funds into
an account designated by the Representative (the " _Administrative
Expense Account_ "). The Representative shall hold the Administrative Expense
Amount in the Administrative Expense Account as a fund from which the
Representative shall be permitted to pay, in its sole and absolute discretion,
(i) any fees, costs and expenses of the Representative that were incurred in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and/or delivery of
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, and/or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents (to the extent not paid at Closing), (ii) any
fees, expenses, costs, losses or damages it incurs in performing its duties
and obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, fees,
costs and expenses incurred pursuant to the procedures and provisions set
forth in _Section 1.5(e)_ and _Article VII_ , and legal, accounting
and consultant fees, expenses and costs for reviewing, analyzing, defending,
pursuing and/or prosecuting any claim or process arising under or pursuant to
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents and (iii) any amount
of Substituted Cash to the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 1.12(a)_
and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Representative may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, invest and reinvest all or any portion of the
Administrative Expense Amount (including any interest earned thereon) in any
manner it so determines or, at the sole option of the Representative, it may
elect not to invest and/or reinvest all or any portion of the Administrative
Expense Amount (including any interest earned thereon).

(b) At such time, and from time to time, that the Representative determines
in its sole and absolute discretion that any portion of the Administrative
Expense Amount will not be required for the payment of fees, expenses, costs,
losses or damages described in  _Section 1.15 (a)_, the Representative shall
distribute such amount from the Administrative Expense Account (any
such amount to be distributed from the Administrative Expense Account being
referred to as a " _Released Administrative Expense Amount_ "). On each
occasion when any Released Administrative Expense Amount is released by the
Representative from the Administrative Expense Account, the Representative
shall direct the financial institution which maintains the Administrative
Expense Account to distribute such Released Administrative Expense Amount to
the Exchange Agent (for further distribution to the Stockholders (other than
the Specified Stockholders)), to the Specified Stockholders and to the
Surviving Company (for further distribution to the Participating
Optionholders and the Bonus Payment Recipients), all in the same amounts and
in the same manner that such Released Administrative Expense Amount would be
distributed to such Persons if such Released Administrative Expense Amount
was an Escrow Amount distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 1.15(b)_ shall be deemed to relieve,
limit, diminish or otherwise reduce or impair the reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of the Sellers to the Representative under
_Section 1.12_ or any of the reimbursement or indemnification obligations of
Holdco pursuant to  _Section 7.7_.

Governmental Entities (" _Approvals_ ") necessary to own, lease and operate
the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted in the ordinary course, except where

Documents" shall mean the Certificate of Formation and limited

qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, individually or in

obligations to provide statutory severance pay to its employees are fully
funded or accrued on the Company's books and records and, to the knowledge of

Governmental Entity binding upon the Company or its assets or to which the
Company is a party which has or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of the
Company, any acquisition of property by the Company or the conduct of

property are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms,

event of default of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
other party thereto (or any event which with notice or lapse of time, or both,

and effectiveness or the existence of such default or event of default would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Each Material Company Contract is in full force and effect (other than
any Material Company Contract that has expired or has terminated in
accordance with its terms or that has been terminated not in violation of this
Agreement) and, to the extent in full force and effect, to the Company's
knowledge, is valid and binding upon and enforceable against each of the
parties thereto, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity) and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought. To the Company's knowledge, no other party to a Material
Company Contract is the subject of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding. True, correct and complete copies of all Material Company
Contracts have been heretofore delivered or made available to Parent or
Parent's counsel.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.19_ and assuming that all consents,
approvals, notices and disclosures described on _Schedule 2.5(b)_ are
obtained or made (as applicable) _,_ neither the Company nor, to the Company's
knowledge, any other party thereto is in breach of or in default under, and
no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both would
become a breach of or default under, any Material Company Contract, and no
party to any Material Company Contract has given any written notice of any
claim of any such breach, default or event, which (in any such case),

Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

2.20  _Insurance_. _Schedule 2.20_ sets forth the Company's insurance
policies and fidelity and surety bonds covering the assets, business,
equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers and directors
(collectively, the " _Insurance Policies_ "). The coverages provided by such
Insurance Policies are adequate in amount and scope for the
Company's business and operations, including any insurance required to be
maintained by Material Company Contracts.

  



  

2.21  _Governmental Actions/Filings_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.21(a)_ , the Company has been granted
and holds, and has made, all Governmental Actions/Filings (including, without
limitation, Governmental Actions/Filings required for emission or discharge of
effluents and pollutants into the air and the water) necessary to the conduct
by the Company of its business (as presently conducted), except for any
Governmental Actions/Filings the failure of which to have been granted to,
held by or made by the Company would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. True,
complete and correct copies of each such Governmental Actions/Filing has
heretofore been delivered or made available to Parent. Each such Governmental
Actions/Filing is in full force and effect and the Company is in substantial
compliance with all of its obligations with respect thereto, except for any
such noncompliance which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect upon the Company. No event has occurred and is
continuing which requires or permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both
would require or permit, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents will not require or
permit (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), any modification or
termination of any such Governmental Actions/Filings except such events
which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect upon the Company.

  



   

34 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.21(b)_ , no Governmental Action/Filing
is necessary to be obtained, secured or made by the Company to enable it to
continue to conduct its businesses and operations and use its properties after
the Closing in a manner which is materially consistent with current practice.

  



  

2.22  _Interested Party Transactions_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.22_
hereto, no employee, officer, director or shareholder of the Company or a
member of his or her immediate family is liable to the Company for any
borrowed money, nor is the Company liable to any such Person for any borrowed
money (or committed to make loans to, or guarantee credit for the benefit of,
any such Person), other than (i) for payment of compensation for services
rendered, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred on behalf of
the Company, (iii) for other employee benefits made generally available to all
employees, (iv) obligations under any employment agreement with any such
Person and (v) pursuant to a Company Plan (including with respect to any
Person's ownership of shares or right to purchase shares of the Company).
Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.22_ , to the Company's knowledge, none of
the Insiders has any direct or indirect ownership interest in any Person
(other than the Company) that is a party to any Material Company Contract, or
in any Person that competes with the Company, except that each Insider and
members of their respective immediate families may own less than 5% of the
outstanding stock in publicly traded companies that may compete with the
Company. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.22_ , to the knowledge of the
Company, no Insider or any member of an Insider's immediate family (with
respect to an Insider that is an individual) is, directly or indirectly,
financially interested in any Material Company Contract with the Company
(other than such contracts as relate to any such Person's ownership
of capital stock or other securities of the Company or such Person's
employment with the Company or any Company Plan).

required committee or subgroup thereof) has, as of the date of this
Agreement, duly approved, subject to the Company Stockholder Approval, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

with the assistance of the Company, and file such Registration Statement with

Warrants and Parent Rights in accordance with their terms and (2) the Holdco
Shares to be issued in the Transaction Merger, and include in such
Registration Statement proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies
from holders of Parent Ordinary Shares to vote, at a meeting of holders of
Parent Ordinary Shares to be called and held for such purpose (the "
_Extraordinary General Meeting_ "), in favor of (i) the adoption of this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger and the approval of the Mergers (the "
_Merger Proposal_ "), (ii) the election to the board of directors of Holdco

and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment on the
Registration Statement prior to its filing with the SEC. Parent and Holdco
shall not file the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, with the SEC without obtaining the Company's prior written approval
of such filing (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In the event Parent and/or Holdco receive from the staff of the SEC
(either before or after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act) any oral or written comments on, or other
communication relating to, the Registration Statement (including any request
by the SEC staff for an amendment of or supplement to the Registration
Statement or for additional information), Parent and Holdco shall promptly
deliver to the Company and its counsel a copy of such written communication
or, in the case of an oral communication, a complete summary thereof. Parent

Registration Statement by the SEC, Parent and Holdco shall distribute the
proxy statement and other proxy materials included in the Registration
Statement to the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares and, pursuant thereto,
shall call the Extraordinary General Meeting in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirements and Parent's Charter Documents to be held on a date as
soon as practicable following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, solicit
proxies from such holders to vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
and the Plan of Merger and the approval of the Mergers and the other matters
presented to the shareholders of Parent for approval or adoption at the

Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first
distributed to holders of Parent Ordinary Shares and at the time of the
Extraordinary General Meeting, contain any statement which, at such time and
in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not false or misleading ( _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information furnished by
the Company in writing to Parent for inclusion in the Registration
Statement).

  



  

(d) Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in the proxy
statement contained in the Registration Statement the recommendation of its
board of directors that the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Proposal, the Director Proposal, the Charter
Amendments Proposal, the Holdco Plan and the PIPE Proposal and shall otherwise
use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of such
proposals by the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares. Neither Parent's board of
directors nor any committee or agent or representative thereof shall withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), or propose to withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to the Company), the Parent board of directors'
recommendation that the holders of Parent Ordinary Shares vote in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Proposal, the Director Proposal, the
Charter Amendments Proposal, the Holdco Plan and the PIPE Proposal. No
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement will be made by Parent
without the prior written approval of the Company, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and Parent shall promptly transmit any such amendment
or supplement to its shareholders, if at any time prior to the Extraordinary
General Meeting there shall be discovered any information that should be set

participate in the meeting and (e) consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either
such party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any other applicable competition laws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor Parent (nor their respective ultimate parent
entities, as such term is used in the HSR Act) shall be required to disclose
to any other party any information contained in its HSR Notification and
Report Form (or other applicable form, filing, application or submission made
or submitted under any other applicable competition law) which such Person,
in its sole discretion, deems confidential. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may
be required to cause the termination or expiration of the notice periods
under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition Laws as promptly as
possible after the date of this Agreement. Filing fees with respect to the
notifications required under the HSR Act shall be split evenly between Parent
and the Company.

Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without further review or consent of the Company so long as such language (x)
is being used in such other filings or documents in the same context as it was
originally being used and approved by the Company in the Signing Form 8-K and
(y) is not materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which it
is made in such other filings or documents.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall also issue a joint press release in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company announcing the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Signing Press Release_ ").

  



  

(c) At least five (5) days prior to Closing, Parent and Holdco shall prepare
a draft Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the Closing, together with, or
incorporating by reference, the financial statements prepared by the Company
and its accountant, and such other information that may be required to be
disclosed with respect to the Mergers in any report or form to be filed with
the SEC (" _Closing Form 8-K_ "), the form and substance of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to Closing, Parent, Holdco and
the Company shall prepare a press release in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Company announcing the consummation of the
Mergers (" _Closing Press Release_ "). Concurrently with the Closing, Parent
shall issue the Closing Press Release. Concurrently with the Closing, or as

(d) Parent shall file all such forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by Parent with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement through
the Closing Date (the " _Additional Parent SEC Reports_ "). The Additional
Parent SEC Reports shall be prepared in accordance and comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and,
to the extent any such Additional Parent SEC Reports relate to the Mergers,
the Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such
Additional Parent SEC Reports shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company. The Additional Parent SEC Reports will not, at
the time they are filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As used in this _Section 5.3_ , the
term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a
document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to
the SEC.

  



  

5.4 _Required Information_.

  



  

(a) In connection with the preparation of the Signing Form 8-K, the Signing
Press Release, the Registration Statement, the Closing Form 8-K and the
Closing Press Release, or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, Holdco and/or the Company to any Governmental
Entity or other third party in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (each, a " _Reviewable Document_ "), and for
such other reasonable purposes, Parent, Holdco and the Company each shall,
upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
themselves, their respective directors, officers and shareholders (including
the directors of Parent and the Company to be elected to the board of Parent
effective as of the Closing pursuant to _Section 5.1_ hereof) and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
preparation of such materials.

  



  

(b) At a reasonable time prior to the filing, issuance or other submission or
public disclosure of a Reviewable Document by either Parent, Holdco or Merger
Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, the other Party shall
be given an opportunity to review and comment upon such Reviewable Document
and give its prior written consent to the form thereof, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and each Party shall accept
and incorporate all reasonable comments from the other Party to any such
Reviewable Document prior to filing, issuance, submission or disclosure
thereof.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Parent, Holdco and the Company shall
each notify the other as promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of
any written or oral comments of the SEC on, or of any written or oral request
by the SEC for amendments or supplements to, any Reviewable Document, and
shall promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between it
or any of its representatives and the SEC with respect to any of the
foregoing filings. Parent, Holdco and the Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with each other, to
resolve all such requests or comments with respect to any Reviewable Document
as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of any requests or
comments of the SEC. All correspondence and communications to the SEC made by
Parent, Holdco or the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be considered to be
Reviewable Documents subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

5.5 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) _Confidentiality_. Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub shall, and Parent,
Holdco and Merger Sub shall cause their Subsidiaries and Representatives
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to, treat all nonpublic
information obtained in connection with this Agreement (including in
connection with the access provisions of _Section 5.5(b)_ hereof) and the
transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms
of that certain letter agreement, dated June 16, 2017, between the Company and
Parent (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The Company agrees to treat all nonpublic
information regarding Parent obtained by the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as confidential and to
abide by the same restrictions on disclosure of such information as Parent has
agreed to with respect to "Evaluation Material" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement); _provided_ , that (x) such obligations of
confidentiality and non-disclosure shall be subject to the same exceptions as
are set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the scope of such
nonpublic information regarding Parent shall be subject to the same exceptions
as are applicable to Evaluation Material as set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect, subject to _Section 8.2(b)_ hereof.

  



  

(b) _Access to Information_.

  



  

(i) The Company will afford Parent, at Parent's expense, and its financial
advisors, accountants, counsel and other representatives ( _provided_ , that
Parent shall cause such financial advisors, accountants, counsel and other
representatives to treat any information gained thereby as confidential)
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books, records, Specified Company Employees and, with the prior
written consent of a Specified Company Employee, any of the other employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to which any Specified Company Employee
provides his or her written consent during the period prior to the Closing to
obtain all information concerning the business, including the status of
business development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel
of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request. No information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this _Section
5.5_ will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Mergers. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be required to provide any such access to the extent that it
would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (y) disclose
information subject to attorney-client privilege, (y) violate any
applicable Legal Requirements or (z) violate any confidentiality obligations
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are bound. All requests for
such access shall be directed to a Specified Company Employee or such other
person as the Company may designate in writing to Parent from time to time.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the
Closing, without the express prior written consent of a Specified Company
Employee, which consent may be withheld for any reason, neither
Parent, Holdco nor Merger Sub, nor any of their officers, directors,
employees, auditors or other agents (A) shall contact any vendors or
suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason related to
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the business of the Company, or (B) shall have any right to
perform sampling or any invasive or subsurface investigations of any
properties or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) Parent will afford the Company and its financial advisors, underwriters,
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books,
records and personnel of Parent during the period prior to the Closing to
obtain all information concerning the business, including properties, results
of operations and personnel of Parent, as the Company may reasonably request.
No information or knowledge obtained by the Company in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 will affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Mergers.

  



  

5.6 _Public Disclosure_. From the date of this Agreement until Closing or
termination of this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
jointly prepare all press releases and public announcements pertaining to this
Agreement and the transactions governed by it, and no Party shall issue or
otherwise make any public announcement or communication pertaining to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent
of Parent (in the case of the Company) or the Company (in the case of Parent,
Holdco or Merger Sub), except as required by any applicable Legal Requirements
or by the rules and regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement of a stock
exchange or trading system (but subject to the terms of _Section 5.3_ ). Each
Party will not unreasonably withhold approval from the others with respect to
any press release or public announcement. Subject to the terms of _Section
5.3_ , if any Party determines with the advice of counsel that it is required
to make this Agreement and the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby
public or otherwise issue a press release or make public disclosure with
respect thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making any public
disclosure, consult with the other Parties regarding such disclosure, seek
such confidential treatment for such terms or portions of this Agreement or
such transactions as may be reasonably requested by the other Party and
disclose only such information as is legally compelled to be disclosed. This
provision will not apply to communications by any Party to its counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors. Nothing in _Section 5.5_ , this
_Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement
shall restrict or prohibit (a) the Company from communicating with the
Sellers relating to this Agreement, the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated hereby or (b) any disclosure made in connection with the
enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents.

5.7 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper, desirable or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following:
(i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the defending of
any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. This obligation
shall include, on the part of Parent, sending a termination letter to
Continental, in substantially the form of Exhibit A attached to the
Investment Management Trust Agreement by and between Parent and Continental
dated as of November 24, 2015 (the " _Trust Agreement_ "), no later than the
day prior to the Closing Date. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, Parent and its board of directors and the Company and its board of
directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to the Mergers, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enable the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent
or the Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates
of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock.

  



  

5.8 _No Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any
transactions involving the securities of Parent prior to the time of the
making of a public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
require each of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives to comply with the foregoing requirement.

5.9 _No Claim Against Trust Fund_. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, the Company acknowledges that it has read Parent's final
prospectus dated November 24, 2015 (" _Final Prospectus_ ") and understands
that Parent has established a trust account for the benefit of Parent's
public shareholders (" _Trust Fund_ ") and that Parent may disburse monies
from the Trust Fund only in certain limited situations described in the Final
Prospectus. The Company further acknowledges that, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or, upon termination of this Agreement,
another business combination, are not consummated by the time period set
forth in Parent's Charter Documents, Parent will be obligated to return to
its shareholders the amounts being held in the Trust Fund. Accordingly, the
Company, for itself and its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees,
shareholders, representatives, advisors and Affiliates, hereby waives all
rights, title, interest or claim of any kind against Parent to collect from
the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed to them by Parent for any reason
whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement by Parent
or any negotiations, agreements or understandings with Parent (whether in the
past, present or future), and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund at
any time for any reason whatsoever; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 5.9_ shall amend, limit, alter, change, supersede or otherwise
modify the right of the Company to (a) bring any action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief
(including, without limitation, the right of the Company to compel specific
performance by Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub of their respective obligations
under this Agreement) or (b) bring or seek a claim for damages against Parent,
Holdco and/or Merger Sub, or any of their respective successors or assigns,
for any breach of this Agreement (but such claim shall not be against the
Trust Fund or any funds distributed from the Trust Fund to holders of Parent
Ordinary Shares in accordance with Parent's Charter Documents). This
paragraph will survive this Agreement and will not expire and will not be
altered in any way without the express written consent of Parent.

  



  

5.10 _Disclosure of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company will
provide the other with written notice, promptly after obtaining
knowledge thereof, of any event, development or condition that (a) would
cause any of such Party's representations and warranties to become untrue or
misleading such that any of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ will not
be satisfied or which may affect its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) had it existed or been known on the
date hereof would have been required to be disclosed under this Agreement,
(c) gives such Party any reason to believe that any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ is likely not to be satisfied by the Outside Date, or
(d) would require any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement.
Each of Parent and the Company shall have the obligation to supplement or
amend the Company Schedule and the Parent Schedule, as applicable
(collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), being delivered concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement with respect to any matter hereafter
arising or discovered which, if existing or known at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedules prepared by such Party (any such supplement or amendment
a " _Disclosure Supplement_ ") and, upon delivery of any such
Disclosure Supplement, the applicable Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed
supplemented and amended. The obligations of each of Parent and the Company
to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules being delivered herewith shall
terminate on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any such amendment or
supplementation, for purposes of _Sections 6.2(a)_ , _6.3(a)_ , _7.1(a)(i)_ ,
_7.1(b)(i)_ ,  _8.1(d)_ and _8.1(e)_ , the representations and warranties of
the parties shall be made with reference to the Disclosure Schedules as they
exist at the time of execution of this Agreement, subject to such anticipated
changes as are set forth in _Schedule 4.1_ or otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or that are set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules as they exist on the date of this Agreement.

5.11 _Securities Listing_. Parent and Holdco shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to continue the listing for trading of
Holdco's securities on Nasdaq from and after the Mergers and to cause the
Holdco Shares to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby to be approved for listing on Nasdaq at the Closing.

  



  

5.12 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) The Company will not, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its respective Affiliates, employees, agents, officers, directors and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or enter into
discussions or transactions with, or knowingly encourage, or provide any
information to, any corporation, partnership or other entity or group (other
than Parent and its designees) concerning any merger, sale of ownership
interests and/or assets (other than assets sold in the ordinary course of
business) of the Company, recapitalization or similar transaction involving
the Company, and, until the Closing, each of Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub
will not, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
respective Affiliates, employees, agents and representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, solicit or enter into discussions or transactions with, or
encourage, or provide any information to, any corporation, partnership or
other entity or group (other than the Company and its designees)
concerning any merger, purchase of ownership interests and/or assets of
Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub, recapitalization or similar
business combination transaction involving Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub. In
addition, (i) the Company will, and will cause its Affiliates, employees,
agents and representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any alternative merger, sale of ownership interests and/or assets (other
than assets sold in the ordinary course of business) of the Company,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company and (ii) each of
Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub will, and will cause its respective Affiliates,
employees, agents and representatives to, immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any alternative merger, purchase of ownership interests and/or
assets of Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub, recapitalization or similar business
combination transaction involving Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub. The Company
will promptly notify Parent if it receives, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, if any of its or its Affiliates' employees, agents, officers,
directors or representatives receives, after the date of this Agreement any
proposal, offer or submission with respect to any alternative merger, sale of
ownership interests and/or assets (other than assets sold in the ordinary
course of business) of the Company, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving the Company. Parent will promptly notify the Company if it
receives, or, to the knowledge of Parent, if any of its or its
Affiliates' employees, agents, officers, directors or representatives
receives, after the date of this Agreement any proposal, offer or
submission with respect to any alternative merger, sale of ownership
interests and/or assets of Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub, recapitalization or
similar transaction involving Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the time, but
not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal from any Person that did not result from a
breach of _Section 5.12(a)_ , (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") may
provide non-public information and data concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries in response to a request therefor by such Person if the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not
materially more favorable to such Person with respect to confidentiality than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (ii) the Company and
the Company Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal (with the
Company promptly updating Parent as to the results of such discussions or
negotiations), except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ , such actions shall be
permitted if (x) the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized
committee thereof) determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, and (y) the
Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof) has
determined (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal would be, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and the
Company Representatives may contact such Person, before making the
determination set forth in _clause (x)_ and _clause (y)_  above, to clarify
the terms and conditions of such proposal, including to clarify whether such
Acquisition Proposal would be, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal and the extent of any diligence that may be required by such Person.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee
thereof) may (x) withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation that the
stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement or recommend, adopt or
approve any Superior Proposal (any of the foregoing, a " _Recommendation
Withdrawal_ "), or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section 8.1(h)_ , in either case if (i) the Company receives a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized
committee thereof) determines, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that failure to make such Recommendation Withdrawal or to terminate this
Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements, (iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance of such Recommendation Withdrawal
or termination, that it intends to make a Recommendation Withdrawal or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ , which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, (iv)
after providing such notice and prior to making such Recommendation
Withdrawal or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ , the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent during such five
(5)-Business Day period (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the PIPE Investment as
would permit the Board of Directors of the Company not to make such
Recommendation Withdrawal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(h)_ in response to such Superior Proposal, and (v) the Board of Directors
of the Company (or an authorized committee thereof) shall have considered any
changes to this Agreement and the PIPE Investment definitively offered by
Parent and shall have determined in good faith that, after giving effect to
such changes, (A) such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal or (B) the failure to make such Recommendation Withdrawal
or to terminate this Agreement would still be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of the Company (or an authorized committee
thereof) under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event that the Superior Proposal is thereafter modified in any material
respect by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall provide
written notice of such modified Superior Proposal to Parent and shall again
comply with this  _Section 5.12(c)_ and provide Parent with an additional
notice prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ (and
shall do so for each subsequent material modification).

5.13 _Charter Protections; Directors ' and Officers' Liability Insurance_.

  



  

(a) If the Closing occurs, all rights to exculpation, indemnification,
contribution and reimbursement and advancement of expenses, and all
limitations on liability, existing in favor of any current or former officer,
employee, agent or member of the board of directors or board of managers (or
comparable governing body) of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ ") as provided in the Charter
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or in any
agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
providing for similar rights and limitations in favor of any of the Company
Indemnitees, in any such case as in effect as of immediately prior to the
Closing shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and each of
its Subsidiaries to, honor all such rights and limitations after the Closing.
All such rights of exculpation, indemnification, contribution and
reimbursement and advancement of expenses, and all such limitations on
liability, shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnitee without the consent of such affected
Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.13(a)_ ). If the
Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Surviving Company shall pay all costs and expenses to any Company Indemnitee,
as incurred, in connection with enforcing the exculpation,
indemnity, contribution, reimbursement, advancement, limitations or other
rights or obligations provided for in this _Section 5.13(a)_.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail"
officers' and directors' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
policies naming the Company Indemnitees as direct beneficiaries with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date in respect of acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, such insurance policies
to contain terms with respect to coverage and to be in an amount not less
favorable than the officers' and directors' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
as in effect on the date of this Agreement and shall be reviewed by, and
approved in advance by, the Company. In the event that any Company Indemnitee
is entitled to coverage under any such officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy or fiduciary liability insurance policy pursuant to this
_Section 5.13(b)_  and any such policy has lapsed, terminated, been
repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a result of Parent's, the
Surviving Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' failure to maintain and
fulfill its obligations pursuant to such policy, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Company or such Subsidiary to, pay to the Company Indemnitee
such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as the Company
Indemnitee shall have received pursuant to such policy.

(c) In the event Parent, the Surviving Pubco or any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Company, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or its
applicable Subsidiary (or their respective successors and assigns) assume in
writing the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.13_  (the Surviving
Pubco being deemed to have assumed such obligations).

  



  

5.14 _Insider Loans; Equity Ownership in Subsidiaries_. The Company shall
cause each Insider of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, at or prior to
Closing (i) repay to the Company any loan by the Company to such Person and
any other amount owed by such Person to the Company (other than the loan set
forth on _Schedule 5.14_ ); (ii) cause any guaranty or similar arrangement
pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the payment or performance of
any obligations of such Person to a third party to be terminated; and (iii)
cease to own any direct equity interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or
in any other Person that utilizes the name "Lazy Days" or any derivative
thereof.

  



  

5.15 _Certain Financial Information_. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after
the end of each month (commencing with the month of November) between the
date hereof and the earlier of the Closing Date and the date on which this
Agreement is terminated, the Company shall deliver to Parent unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company for such month, including a
balance sheet, statement of operations, statement of cash flows and statement
of shareholders' equity, that are certified by the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company as being prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis with the Unaudited Financial Accounts and fairly presenting in all
material respects the financial position of the Company at the date thereof
and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period indicated,
except that such statements need not contain notes and may be subject to
normal adjustments that are not expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. This _Section 5.15_ shall not be deemed to limit the obligation
of the Company under _Section 5.5(b)(i)_ hereof.

  



  

5.16 _Access to Financial Information_. The Company will, and will instruct
its auditors to (a) continue to provide Parent and its advisors full access
to all of the Company's financial information used in the preparation of its
Audited Financial Statements and Unaudited Financial Accounts and the

Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of
the status of such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to approve any settlement, which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , that, in the
event that the Indemnifying Party provides prior written notice to the
Indemnified Party of any settlement or compromise of, or offer to settle or
compromise, any Third Party Claim in full and the Indemnified Party withholds
its consent to such settlement or compromise then, in the event
indemnification is ultimately determined to be owing to an Indemnified Party
hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim, in no event shall
indemnification be provided to such Indemnified Party in respect of such Third
Party Claim in an amount greater than the amount contained in such settlement
or compromise of, or offer to settle or compromise, such Third Party Claim;
and

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in all respects with the
Indemnifying Party in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all pertinent
information and documents under its control.

  



  

(c) _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim if
(i) such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation against
an Indemnified Party; or (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against an Indemnified Party.

  



  

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to provide
copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant available data
shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) by an Indemnifying Party
to any Third Party Claim for which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure
shall have adversely affected the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend
against such Third Party Claim or caused the Losses for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to recover to be greater than such Losses would
have been had the Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party prompt
notice hereunder or provided relevant documents or relevant available data. So
long as the Indemnifying Party is defending any such Third Party Claim
actively and in good faith, the Indemnified Party (or anyone acting on its
behalf) shall not settle such Third Party Claim. Promptly after the delivery
of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party all relevant records and other relevant materials required
by the Indemnifying Party and in the possession or under the control of the
Indemnified Party, for the use of the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives in defending any such Third Party Claim, and shall in all
other respects give reasonable cooperation in such defense.

  



   

81 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Indemnifying Party fails to defend a Third
Party Claim actively and in good faith within thirty (30) days after
receiving a Notice of Claim, the Indemnified Party will (upon further written
notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim as it may determine in its reasonable discretion,
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to approve any
compromise or settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f) _Indemnified Party Rights_. Anything in this _Section 7.2_ to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Third Party
Claim which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff to each of the applicable Indemnified Parties
of a full and unconditional release from all liability and obligation in
respect of such Third Party Claim, without any payment by any Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(g) _Consent_. Unless the Indemnifying Party has consented to a settlement of
a Third Party Claim, the amount of the settlement shall not be a binding
determination of the amount of the Loss and such amount shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

  



  

7.3 _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ are recoverable pursuant to
indemnification rights or other reimbursement arrangements or pursuant to
insurance, Parent shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain
the maximum recovery under such indemnification rights, reimbursement
arrangements or insurance;  _provided_ that Parent shall nevertheless be
entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_  in
respect of such Losses. The existence of a claim by Parent for monies from an
insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss shall not, however,
delay recovery by Parent for such Loss pursuant to the indemnification
provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be recoverable by
Parent. If Parent has received the payment required by this Agreement from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from
indemnification rights or other reimbursement arrangements or pursuant to
insurance in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other
amounts in trust for the benefit of the Representative and shall pay to the
Representative, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum equal to the
amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the aggregate amount
of any payments received from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that no insurer or any
other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled
to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or
(ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is
obligated.

7.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Survival; Time Limitation_. Claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 7.1(a)_ and/or _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be made after the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Expiration
Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ for breaches of covenants, which by their
terms are to be performed, in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions,
subsequent to the Closing Date (collectively, " _Post-Closing Covenants_ "),
may be made until thirty (30) days after the last date on which each such
Post-Closing Covenant was required to be performed (in each case, a " _Post-
Closing Covenant Survival Expiration Date_ "), and (ii) claims for
indemnification pursuant to (x) _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ resulting from any
inaccuracy or breach of any of the Specified Representations of the Company
or (y) _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ resulting from any inaccuracy or breach of any of
the Specified Representations of Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub (the claims
described in _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ , collectively, the " _Surviving Claims_
") may be made until the date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date
(the " _Extended Survival Expiration Date_ "). Any claim for indemnification
under _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_ not made by the applicable
Indemnified Party on or prior to the Survival Expiration Date, the Post-
Closing Covenant Survival Expiration Date or the Extended Survival Expiration
Date, as applicable, shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally released
and waived. In addition, no Indemnified Party shall have any right to assert
any claims for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII _ with respect
to any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent it is (A) a possible
or potential Loss, cause of action or claim that such Indemnified Party
believes may be asserted rather than a Loss, cause of action or claim that
has, in fact, been filed of record against such Indemnified Party or paid or
incurred by such Indemnified Party or (B) a Loss, cause of action or claim
with respect to which such Indemnified Party has taken action (or caused
action to be taken) to accelerate the time period in which such Loss, cause
of action or claim is asserted or payable.

  



  

(b) Any indemnification claim made by Indemnified Parties prior to the
Survival Expiration Date, the Post-Closing Covenant Survival Expiration Date
or the Extended Survival Expiration Date, as applicable, shall be preserved
(but solely to the extent of the stated amount of such claim in the Notice of
Claim relating thereto) despite the subsequent passage of such date, and any
claim set forth in a Notice of Claim sent prior to the passage of such date
shall survive until final resolution thereof.

  



  

(c) _Deductible_. The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to receive
indemnification for Losses pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section 7.1(b)_
unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses otherwise
recoverable by all Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ or
_Section 7.1(b)_ , as applicable, exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "),
and then the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for the
amount in excess thereof (it being understood and agreed that the Deductible
is intended as a deductible, and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
receive indemnification for any Losses under _Section 7.1(a)_ or _Section
7.1(b)_ that are less than the Deductible for which the Indemnified
Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) Losses arising from Surviving Claims shall not be subject to the
Deductible and shall not be included in calculating whether the Deductible has
been satisfied, and (ii) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to receive
indemnification under this _Article VII_ to the extent any Losses are
caused by any action taken or omitted to be taken by, or on behalf of, any
Indemnified Party.

  



   

83

--- 

    



  

(d) _Aggregate Amount Limitation_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified for Losses
pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ (other than Losses resulting from any of the
Surviving Claims), then (A) the sole and exclusive remedy and source of
recovery of the Parent Indemnified Parties for such Losses shall be against
the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, (B) none of the Sellers shall have
any liability to any Parent Indemnified Party for such Losses, except to the
extent of such Seller's interest in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (it being
understood that the Sellers will only be Indemnifying Parties to the extent of
such interest and any amount of such Losses that the Parent Indemnified
Parties recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (based on the amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Cash and the value of the Indemnity Escrow Shares so
recovered) shall be deemed to have been paid by each Seller to the extent of
such Seller's interest in such Indemnity Escrow Fund) and (C) no Parent
Indemnified Party shall have any right, or be entitled, to bring or pursue
any claim directly or personally against any Seller or the Representative in
respect of such Loss.

  



  

(ii) Subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article VII_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, (A) the aggregate amount of Losses for which the
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to
_Section 7.1(a)(i)_  resulting from the Surviving Claims shall not exceed 75%
of the full amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by
the Sellers, (B) the aggregate amount of Losses payable by each Seller
pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ resulting from any Surviving Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such Losses _multiplied by_ such Seller's Pro Rata Share,
and (C) the aggregate amount of Losses payable by each Seller pursuant to
_Section 7.1(a)(i)_ resulting from the Surviving Claims shall not exceed 75%
of the full amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Seller, _less_ in each case set forth in this  _Section 7.4(d)(ii)_ the
aggregate amount of Losses previously paid or to be paid by such Seller
pursuant to this _Article VII_.

  



   

84 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) _Calculation of Losses_. In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article VII_ , the amount of the indemnified Losses
shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made under any other representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation and shall be computed net of any Tax benefit (whether
in the form of reduced Taxes payable, increased rights to Tax refunds or
otherwise) realized or realizable by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates with respect to such Losses. The Indemnified Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to realize any Tax benefit with respect to such
Losses. If an Indemnified Party realizes a Tax benefit with respect to Losses
at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided pursuant to this
_Article VII_ (and provided such Tax benefit was not taken into account in
determining the amount that the Indemnifying Party was required to pay to the
Indemnified Party hereunder in connection with such Losses by reducing the
amount of such payment), then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
the applicable Indemnifying Party for any payment made by such Indemnifying
Party in connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount
realized by such Indemnified Party (but in no event in excess of the amount
paid by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the indemnification claim
giving rise thereto). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall any Parent Indemnified Party be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ with respect to any liability
that is accrued (and then only to the extent thereof) on the Final Statement
or any amount that was the subject of a dispute submitted to, and
resolved by, the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 1.5_ or that was
resolved by the Parties pursuant to _Section 1.5_ , or that was otherwise
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Merger Consideration.

  



  

(f) _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss. In the event the
Indemnified Party shall fail to take, or cause to be taken, such commercially
reasonable steps, then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover that portion
of Losses that would reasonably have been expected to have been avoided if
the Indemnified Party had taken, or caused to be taken, such commercially
reasonable steps.

  



  

(g) _Subrogation_. To the extent that an Indemnifying Party makes any payment
pursuant to this _Article VII_ in respect of Losses for which the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates has a right to recover against a third party
(including an insurance company), the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated
to the right of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates to seek and
obtain recovery from such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnifying Party shall be prohibited from such subrogation, the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall seek recovery from such third
party on the Indemnifying Party's behalf and shall pay any such recovery to
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that any amount so paid to the
Indemnifying Party shall not exceed the amount of the indemnification payment
made by it to the Indemnified Party hereunder. Any such Indemnified Party
shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, execute any instrument
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party to evidence such subrogation
rights.

7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Parent, on behalf of itself and the other Parent
Indemnified Parties, hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, the sole remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to any
and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be pursuant and subject to the requirements of the provisions set forth
in this _Article VII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent, on behalf of
itself and the other Parent Indemnified Parties, hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, any and all
rights, claims, remedies and causes of action for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against any of
the Sellers (including, without limitation, any rights, claims and causes of
action arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or other Legal Requirements), except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VII_.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Article VII_
shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit a Parent Indemnified
Party's right to (i) specific performance or injunctive relief or (ii) bring
any claim, demand or suit against the other party based upon the actual fraud
of the Company with respect to any of the representations and warranties
expressly made by the Company in _Article II_ , it being understood that a
mere breach of a representation and warranty by the Company does not
constitute fraud, _provided however_ , that the maximum aggregate amount that
may be recovered shall not exceed the Merger Consideration actually
received by the Sellers and no Seller shall be liable for more than the
Merger Consideration actually received by such Seller.

  



  

7.6 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for indemnification
under _Article VII_ shall be deemed for all Tax purposes to be an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration, except as otherwise required by Legal
Requirements.

  



  

7.7 _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow_. The Parties
acknowledge that the Representative's obligations under this _Article VII_
are solely as a representative of the Sellers in the manner set forth in the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement and that the Representative shall have no personal
responsibility for any expenses incurred by it in such capacity. Out-of-pocket
expenses of the Representative for attorneys' fees and other costs shall be
borne in the first instance by Parent, which may make a claim for
reimbursement thereof against the Indemnity Escrow Fund upon the claim with
respect to which such expenses are incurred becoming an Established Claim (as
defined in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement). The Parties further acknowledge
that all actions to be taken by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this _Article VII_ shall be taken on their behalf by the Committee in
accordance with the provisions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Representative
shall have no liability to the Company or any Stockholder or any party hereto
for any action taken or omitted to be taken hereunder, unless such liability
is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Representative. The Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the Representative for all losses, damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and costs of investigation) arising out of or in
connection with, the performance by the Representative of its duties and
obligations under this Agreement, unless such liability is determined by a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Representative.

8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) Any termination of this Agreement under _Section 8.1_ above will be
effective immediately upon (or, if the termination is pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_ and the first proviso therein is applicable,
thirty (30) days after) the delivery of written notice of the terminating
party to the other Parties.

  



  

(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
8.1_ , this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and the Mergers
shall be abandoned, and there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on
the part of the Company, the Representative, the Sellers, Parent, Holdco,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective managers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, officers,

subject to the following: (i) _Sections 5.5(a)_ , _5.9_ , _8.2_ and _8.3_ ,
_Article X_ (General Provisions) (other than _Section 10.15_ ) and any

termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement, including a breach by
a Party electing to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_
caused by the action or failure to act of such Party constituting a principal
cause of or resulting in the failure of the Mergers to occur on or before the
Outside Date (subject to _Section 8.3(b)_ ). Following any termination of
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive and remain in
full force and effect for the longer of (x) the remainder of the term as set

termination. Nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall be deemed to impair the
right of any Party to bring any action or actions for specific performance,

--- 

    



  

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Transaction Merger is
consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if the Mergers are not
consummated and the Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement
and has not terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ and Parent
has not terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 8.1(e)_  or _8.1(g)_
, Weil will pay 50% of the PCAOB Amounts that constitute the fees, costs and
expenses of the Company owed to Marcum LLP in connection with the preparation
of the Financial Statements within fifteen (15) days after the termination of
this Agreement and receipt by Weil from the Company of an invoice for such
fees, costs and expenses and (b) if the Transaction Merger is
consummated, then Parent shall pay, and be responsible for, all Fees and
Expenses.

  



  

(b) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ,
then the Company shall pay to Parent, within one (1) Business Day after the
date of such termination, an amount of cash equal to $2,200,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ").

  



  

(c) The Company acknowledges that the damages to Parent in the event the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h) _ are
impossible to quantify and that Parent would be required to dissolve and
liquidate pursuant to its Charter Documents if this occurred. Accordingly,
the Company agrees that the payment of the Termination Fee in such a
circumstance is reasonable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the circumstances where Parent is entitled to receive the
Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ , receipt of
such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub
against the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, and
any of their respective former, current or future managers, directors,
stockholders, members, partners, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, successors or assigns (collectively, " _Company Related
Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Mergers
to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise (excluding willful breaches of this Agreement), and upon payment of
such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Mergers (except with respect to willful breaches of this Agreement).

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the letter of
intent between Parent and the Company executed on or about July 20, 2017, as
amended, is hereby terminated in its entirety and shall be of no further
force and effect (except to the extent expressly stated to survive the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement shall not
supersede the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in
accordance with its terms and this Agreement.

  



  

(b) This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties, Weil, the Sellers,
the Representative and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing herein, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any
other Person any legal or equitable rights hereunder, except that (i) each

each Indemnified Party that is not a party hereto shall be a third party
beneficiary of _Article VII_ , and (iii) each Released Party shall be a third

10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

  



  

10.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each the Parties and
the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties hereby waives any defense that a remedy at law is adequate and any
requirement to post bond or other security in connection with actions
instituted for injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable
remedies. Each of the Parties hereby agrees not to assert that specific
performance, injunctive and other equitable remedies are unenforceable,
violate public policy, invalid, contrary to Legal Requirements or inequitable
for any reason. The right of specific performance, injunctive and other
equitable remedies is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company, Parent, Holdco
nor Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement.

Disclosure Schedules are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement and

information is material or outside the ordinary course of business. The
inclusion of any fact or information in a Disclosure Schedule is not intended
to be construed as an admission or concession as to the legal effect of any
such fact or information in any proceeding between any Party and any Person
who is not a Party.
