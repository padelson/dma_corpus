7\. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.7
or elsewhere in this Agreement (and without limiting any other rights or
remedies available to Parent), Parent shall, subsequent to the rendering of a
final determination pursuant to Section 1.7(e) below, be entitled, in its sole
discretion, to deduct from either the Escrow Fund or any Post-Closing Payment

Fees and Expenses (as defined below).

(d) Promptly following the end of each fiscal quarter during the One-Year
Period, but in no event more than 30 days thereafter, Parent shall in good
faith: (i) prepare or cause to be prepared a non-binding estimate of the
amount of the One Year Bookings as of the end of such fiscal quarter (the "
_Quarterly Statement_ "); and (ii) for informational purposes only, deliver
or cause to be delivered such Quarterly Statement to the Stockholders Agent
for and on behalf of the Eligible Stockholders.

(e) On or before the 60th day following the end of the One-Year Period, Parent
shall: (i) prepare or cause to be prepared a statement (the " _Bookings
Statement_ ") setting forth the One Year Bookings, together with the dollar
amounts of any Post-Closing Payment that Parent believes is due in accordance
with Section 1.7; and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered such Bookings
Statement to the Stockholders Agent for and on behalf of the Eligible
Stockholders.

(f) In the event that the Stockholders Agent objects to Parents calculation
of the Bookings Statement or the dollar amount of any Post-Closing Payment set
forth in any Bookings Statement or requires further information in order to
perform such calculations or determine such amounts, then within 20 days
after the delivery to the Stockholders Agent of such Bookings Statement (the
" _Initial Response Period_ "), the Stockholders Agent shall deliver to
Parent a written notice (an " _Initial Objection Notice_ "): (i) describing
in reasonable detail the Stockholders Agents objections to Parents
calculation of the amounts set forth in such statement and containing a
statement setting forth the One Year Bookings or the amount of any such Post-
Closing Payment determined by the Stockholders Agent to be correct; or (ii)
requesting additional information from Parent that the Stockholders Agent
deems reasonably necessary in order to perform such calculations or determine
such amounts (which information, to the extent reasonably necessary in order
to perform such calculations, shall be provided by Parent within 15 days after
Parents receipt of such request). If the Stockholders Agent does not
deliver an Initial Objection Notice to Parent during the Initial Response
Period, then Parents calculation of the amounts set forth in the Bookings
Statement shall be binding and conclusive on Parent, the Eligible
Stockholders and the Stockholders Agent. If the Stockholders Agent delivers
an Initial Objection Notice to Parent accompanied by a request for additional
information from Parent as described above during the Initial Response Period,
then the Stockholders Agent shall have an additional 20 days after receiving
from Parent either: (x) all of the information requested by the Stockholders
Agent; or (y) written notice from Parent that no further requested information
is to be provided (such 20 day period, the " _Final Response Period_ ") to
deliver to Parent a written notice (a " _Final Objection Notice_ ") describing
in reasonable detail the Stockholders Agents objections to Parents
calculations of the amounts set forth in such Bookings Statement accompanied
by a statement setting forth the One Year Bookings or the dollar amount of any
such Post-Closing Payment determined by the Stockholders Agent to
be correct. If the Stockholders Agent has requested additional information
in an Initial Objection Notice delivered during the Initial Response Period
and does not deliver a Final Objection Notice to Parent during the Final
Response Period, then Parents calculation of the amounts set forth in the
Bookings Statement shall be binding and conclusive on Parent, the Eligible
Stockholders and the  



 

8\.  Stockholders Agent. If the Stockholders Agent delivers an Initial
Objection Notice or Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, accompanied
by a statement setting forth the One Year Bookings or the amount of any such
Post-Closing Payment determined by the Stockholders Agent to be correct to
Parent during either the Initial Response Period or the Final Response Period
in accordance with this Section 1.7(f), and if the Stockholders Agent and
Parent are unable to agree upon the calculation of the amounts set forth in
the Bookings Statement within 30 days after such Initial Objection Notice or
Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, is delivered to Parent, the
dispute shall be finally settled by a "Big Four" accounting firm selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Agent (other than
Parents auditing firm at the time). The determination by the independent
accounting firm of the disputed amounts and the Post-Closing Payments, if any,
shall be conclusive and binding on Parent, the Eligible Stockholders and the
Stockholders Agent. Parent and the Stockholders Agent (on behalf of the
Eligible Stockholders) shall each bear and pay 50% of the fees and other
expenses of such independent accounting firm (the " _Post-Closing Payment Fees
and Expenses_ ").

(g) No rights or interest of any Eligible Stockholder under this Section 1.7
may be assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part,
other than pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution or by will or, in
the case of an Eligible Stockholder that is an entity organized for the
purpose of making venture capital investments, to any entity under common
investment management with such Eligible Stockholder.

(h) At reasonable times during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice provided to Parent, Parent shall permit the Stockholders Agent, to
examine the financial books and records of the Surviving Corporation and/or
Parent, only to the extent necessary for the exercise of the Stockholders
Agents right to object to Parents calculation of the amounts set forth in
the Bookings Statement. The Stockholders Agent agrees that he shall hold all
information acquired during such examination in strict confidence and shall
use such information only for purposes of making calculations under Section
1.7; _provided, however_ , that such information may be provided to agents and
independent contractors of the Stockholders Agent that are subject to
contractual (or, with respect to counsel, professional) confidentiality
obligations in favor of (and for the benefit of) Parent in respect of such
information for use in furtherance of an engagement to assist the
Stockholders Agent in making such calculations as provided for herein.

(i) While Parent currently believes that it is in its best interest that it
and the Company use commercially reasonable efforts to generate One Year
Bookings, it is understood and agreed that: (i) neither Parent nor the Company
has any obligation to use any specified efforts to generate One Year Bookings
(or to sell or license Specified Company Products or enter into or renew
related maintenance contracts); and (ii) Parent (on behalf of itself and on
behalf of any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation)
may discontinue the sale or license of Specified Company Products and the
entering into or renewal of related maintenance contracts at any time without
penalty (it being understood, however, that Parent will act in good faith in
connection with the foregoing).

1.8 Dissenting Shares.

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder
who has demanded and perfected such demand for appraisal of such holders
shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and
as of the Closing has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such holders
right to such appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the applicable Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by the DGCL. Parent shall be entitled to retain any
Merger Consideration not paid on account of such Dissenting Shares pending
resolution of the claims of such holders.



 

9\. (b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 1.8(a), if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who
demands appraisal of such holders shares under the DGCL shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through the failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders
right to appraisal, then as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event,
whichever later occurs, such holders shares of Company Capital Stock shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, promptly following the surrender of
the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Company Capital
Stock.

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock
received by the Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company; and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle any such
demands other than by operation of law or pursuant to a final order of a court
of competent jurisdiction.

1.9 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) _Payment Agent_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a
reputable bank or trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the "
_Payment Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the cash consideration payable pursuant
to Section 1.5 (excluding the Escrow Amount and the Stockholders Agent
Escrow Amount). The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent. Any interest
or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the
property of, and will be paid to, Parent.

(b) _Letter of Transmittal  Capital Stock_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than five days thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Payment Agent to mail to each record holder of Company Capital Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal
containing such provisions as Parent or the Payment Agent may, subject to
reasonable approval of the Stockholders Agent, specify (including
a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates (as
defined in Section 1.9(d)) shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company
Stock Certificates to the Payment Agent, and a provision whereby such holder
agrees to be bound by the provisions of Sections 1.9, 9 and 10.1) (a " _Letter
of Transmittal_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of
Company Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with
respect to such Company Capital Stock. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent
of a Company Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as
described in Section 1.9(e)), together with a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents as Parent or the Payment Agent may
reasonably request, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration, if any, which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.5, and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. From and after the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented shares of
Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares, and the
holder of each such Company Stock Certificate shall cease to have any rights
with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented
thereby. The  



 

10\.  letter of transmittal shall include a request for each such stockholder of
the Company to deliver to the Payment Agent a duly completed and signed copy
of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN (or other appropriate United States Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8).

(c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of
shares of Company Capital Stock converted pursuant to Section 1.5 is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Company
Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that
the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Company Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of
the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares of Company
Capital Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided for in
Section 1.5. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate which immediately
before the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificate
representing shares of Company Capital Stock converted in connection with the
Merger pursuant to Section 1.5 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of
any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock
previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such amount, form and with
such surety as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any affiliated party with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to Effective Time Holders as of the date that is 180
days after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
Effective Time Holders who have not theretofore surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.9 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificates, without any interest thereon.

(g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar Legal Requirement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any Encumbrance.



 

11\. (h) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any security holder or
former security holder of the Company such amounts as Parent determines in
good faith are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection
therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law
or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and subsequently paid to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

notifies Parent in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or breach
(the " _Parent Cure Period_ "), then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach
prior to the expiration of the Parent Cure Period, provided Parent, during the
Parent Cure Period, continues to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such
inaccuracy or breach (it being understood that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) with respect to such inaccuracy
or breach if such inaccuracy or breach is cured prior to the expiration of

   9. | INDEMNIFICATION, ETC. 
---|--- 

9.1 Survival of Representations, Etc.

(a) _General Survival_. Subject to Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.1(d), the
representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement and the
representations and warranties set forth in the Company Closing Certificate
and the Merger Consideration Certificate, in each case other than the
Specified Representations, shall survive the Effective Time and shall expire
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the Termination Date, any
Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the Stockholders Agent a
written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any
of such representations and warranties and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Termination Date until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(b) _Specified Representations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 9.1(a), but subject to Section 9.1(d), the Specified
Representations (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.14, which shall survive until 30 days after the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable thereto (including any extensions thereof))
shall survive the Effective Time until the earlier of: (i) 30 days after the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto (including any
extensions thereof); or (ii) the third anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the applicable expiration
date referred to in this sentence, any Indemnitee (acting in good faith)
delivers to the Stockholders Agent a written notice alleging the existence
an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of such Specified Representations and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 9.2 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
Termination Date until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(c) _Parent Representations_. All representations and warranties made by
Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire as of the Effective Time, and
any liability of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to such representations and
warranties shall thereupon cease.



 

48\. (d) _Intentional Misrepresentation; Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b), the limitations
set forth in Section 9.1(a) and 9.1(b) shall not apply in the case of claims
based upon intentional misrepresentation or fraud. For the purposes of
this Section 9, the term "fraud" is intended to encompass circumstances
involving a misrepresentation made knowingly, intentionally or with reckless
indifference to the truth, rather than mere negligence or gross negligence.

(e) _Representations Not Limited_. The representations, warranties, covenants
and obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, and the rights and
remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnitees, shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by or as a result of any information furnished to, or any
investigation made by or knowledge of, any of the Indemnitees or any of their
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, no
party hereto makes any representations or warranties whatsoever as to the
accuracy of any estimates, projections, forecasts and budgets (it being
understood, however, that: (i) the Company represents and warrants to Parent
that all such estimates, projections, forecasts and budgets have been prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions and information that the Company
reasonably believed to be true and correct as of the time such estimates,
projections, forecasts or budgets were made available to Parent; and (b) no
provision in this sentence or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit any
partys rights or remedies in the case of fraud).

(f) _Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or
other item of information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or in any
update to the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

9.2 Indemnification.

(a) _Indemnification by the Stockholders_. From and after the Effective Time
(but subject to Section 9.1), each Effective Time Holder (collectively, the "
_Indemnitors_ "), severally and not jointly, shall hold harmless and
indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages which are directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of
the Indemnitees may otherwise directly or indirectly become subject
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim)
and which arise directly or indirectly from or as a result of, or are directly
or indirectly connected with: 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement (without giving
effect to: (i) any materiality or similar qualification limiting the scope of
such representation or warranty; or (ii) any update of or modification to the
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date
of this Agreement);

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company: (i) in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty was
made on and as of the Closing; or (ii) in the Company Closing Certificate (in
each case, without giving effect to: (A) any materiality or similar
qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty; or (B)
any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to
have been made on or after the date of this Agreement);

(iii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in the Merger Consideration Certificate;

 

(iv) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company in this
Agreement;



 

49\. (v) the exercise by any stockholder of the Company of such
stockholders appraisal rights under the DGCL for any amount in excess of
what is payable by Parent in accordance with Section 1.5 hereof; or

(vi) any Legal Proceeding relating to any breach or alleged breach or any
other matter of the type referred to in clause "(i)," "(ii)," "(iii)," "(iv)"
or "(v)" above (including any Legal Proceeding commenced by any Indemnitee
for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this Section 9).

(b) _Damage to Parent_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the
Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any
Damages as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting
any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall
also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving
Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with
such inaccuracy or breach; _provided, however_ , that any recovery by either
party of such Damages shall preclude recovery of such Damages by the other
party.

(c) _Tax Matters_. All indemnity payments made under this Agreement shall be
treated as purchase price adjustments for federal and state income tax
purposes.

9.3 Limitations.

(a) _Basket_. Subject to Section 9.3(b), the Indemnitors shall not be required
to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section
9.2(a)(ii) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement until such time as the total amount of all Damages
(including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all other
Damages arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any representations
or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by
any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the
Indemnitees has or have otherwise directly or indirectly become subject,
exceeds $75,000 in the aggregate. If the total amount of such Damages exceeds
$75,000 in the aggregate, then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to be
indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the entire amount of
such Damages, and not merely the portion of such Damages exceeding $75,000.

(b) _Applicability of Basket_. The limitations set forth in Section 9.3(a)
shall not apply: (i) in the case of intentional misrepresentation or fraud;
(ii) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Specified Representations;
(iii) to the matters referred to in Sections 9.2(a)(iii), 9.2(a)(iv) and
9.2(a)(v); or (v) to the matters referred to in Section 9.2(a)(vi) (to the
extent related to any of the matters referred to in clauses "(i)" through
"(iii)" of this sentence).

(c) _Recourse to Escrow_. Subject to Section 9.3(d), recourse by the
Indemnitees to the Escrow Amount shall be the Indemnitees sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary Damages resulting from the matters referred to in Section
9.2.

(d) _Applicability of Liability Cap_. The limitations set forth in Section
9.3(c) shall not apply: (i) in the case of intentional misrepresentation or
fraud; (ii) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Specified
Representations; (iii) to the matters referred to in Sections 9.2(a)(iii),
9.2(a)(iv) and 9.2(a)(v); or (iv) to the matters referred to in Section
9.2(a)(vi) (to the extent related to any of the matters referred to in clauses
"(i)" through "(iii)" of this sentence). Except in the case of intentional
misrepresentation or fraud, the total amount of indemnification payments that
each Indemnitor can be required to make to the Indemnitees pursuant to Section
9.2 shall be limited to the Merger Consideration received by such Indemnitor.



 

50\. 9.4 No Contribution. Each Indemnitor waives, and acknowledges and agrees that
he shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or
assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against Merger Sub or the Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he may become
subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or
document delivered to Parent in connection with this Agreement.

9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
Merger Sub, the Company, Parent or any other Person) with respect to which
any Indemnitor may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9, Parent shall have the right,
at its election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Stockholders Agent. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim
or Legal Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of Section 9, all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitors;

(b) each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents and
materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

(c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Legal Proceeding; _provided, however,_ that if Parent settles, adjusts or
compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the
Stockholders Agent, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be
conclusive evidence of the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding (it being understood that if
Parent requests that the Stockholders Agent consent to a settlement,
adjustment or compromise, the Stockholders Agent shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent).

Parent shall give the Stockholders Agent prompt written notice of the
commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company; _provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent to so
notify the Stockholders Agent shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnitors under Section 9 (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). If Parent does not elect to
proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the
Stockholders Agent may proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent; _provided,
however,_ that the Stockholders Agent may not settle, adjust or compromise
any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

9.6 Setoff. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9, in addition to
any rights of setoff or other similar rights that Parent or any of the other
Indemnitees may have at common law or otherwise, Parent shall have the right
to withhold and deduct any sum that may be owed to any Indemnitee under
this Section 9 from any amount otherwise payable by any Indemnitee to any
Indemnitor in respect of shares of such Indemnitors Company Capital Stock (it
being understood that: (a) if there are any Available Escrow Funds (as defined
below), Parent shall seek recovery of any indemnification claim against such
Available Escrow Funds prior to seeking recovery pursuant to the setoff rights
described in this Section 9.6; and (b) " _Available Escrow Funds_ " shall
mean any portion of the Escrow Fund that remains in the Escrow Fund and is
not subject to pending claims).



 

51\. ---|--- 

10.1 Stockholders Agent.

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement, the
Indemnitors irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint Donald A. Sullivan as
the agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of the stockholders (the "
_Stockholders  Agent_"), with full power of substitution, to act in the
name, place and stead of the Indemnitors for purposes of executing any
documents and taking any actions that the Stockholders Agent may, in his sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection
with any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under
Section 9 or under the Escrow Agreement. Donald A. Sullivan hereby accepts his
appointment as Stockholders Agent.

(b) _Authority_. The Indemnitors grant to the Stockholders Agent full
authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of
such Indemnitors (in the name of any or all of the Indemnitors or otherwise)
any and all documents that the Stockholders Agent may, in his sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such
forms and containing such provisions as the Stockholders Agent may, in his
sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing his duties as
contemplated by Section 10.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby: (i) each Indemnitee shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders Agent on all matters
relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
under Section 9 or under the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) each Indemnitee shall
be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Indemnitor by the Stockholders Agent, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any stockholder by the Stockholders Agent,
as fully binding upon such stockholder. 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Indemnitors recognize and intend that the power
of attorney granted in Section 10.1(a): (i) is coupled with an interest and
is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Stockholders Agent; and (iii)
shall survive the death or incapacity of each of the Indemnitors.

(d) _Replacement_. If the Stockholders Agent shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder,
the Indemnitors shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a
majority of the Merger Consideration), within 30 days after such death,
disability or inability, appoint a successor to the Stockholders Agent (who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter notify
Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed the
Stockholders Agent as Stockholders Agent hereunder. If for any reason there
is no Stockholders Agent at any time, all references herein to the
Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnitors.

(e) _Stockholder s Agent Escrow Fund_. The Company and the Stockholders
Agent will, at least two days prior to the Closing Date, direct by joint
written notice(s) to the Paying Agent that on the Closing Date a portion of
the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Effective Time Holders, in
an amount equal to the Stockholders Agent Escrow Amount, shall be withheld
and paid directly by the Paying Agent to an account maintained by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement in a form to be agreed to
by the Company and the Stockholders Agent (the  



 

52\.  "Stockholders Agent Escrow Agreement") as designated in such notice, as a
fund for the fees and expenses of the Stockholders Agent incurred in
connection with this Agreement (the " _Stockholders  Agent Escrow Fund_"),
with any balance of the Stockholders Agent Escrow Fund not used for such
purposes to be returned to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with the
Stockholders Agent Escrow Agreement. The Effective Time Holders, by approval
of this Agreement, agree that all interest or other income earned from the
investment of the Stockholders Agent Escrow Fund in any Tax year shall be
reported as allocated to the Effective Time Holders in proportion to their
interests in the Stockholders Agent Escrow Fund.

(f) _Exculpation_. The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to any
Effective Time Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders
Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment,
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Effective Time Holders shall
jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholders Agent and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.
Nothing in this paragraph shall limit Parents rights against the
Stockholders Agent.

10.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.3 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 1.5 and 9, the Escrow Agreement
and _Exhibit B_ , each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees,
costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are incurred in the future
by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party

the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought against any
party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to
which the prevailing party may be entitled).

(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

(b) _Venue_. Except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement or in

enforcement of any provision of this Agreement (including a Legal Proceeding
based upon intentional misrepresentation or fraud) may be brought or
otherwise commenced in any state or federal court located in the State of
Delaware. Each party to this Agreement: (i) expressly and irrevocably consents
and submits to the jurisdiction of each state and federal court located in
the State of Delaware (and each appellate court located in the State of
Delaware) in connection with any such Legal Proceeding; (ii) agrees that each
state and federal court located in the State of Delaware shall be deemed to be
a convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such Legal Proceeding commenced in any state or
federal court located in the State of Delaware, any claim that such party is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that such Legal
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such
proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court.

(c) _Indemnification Claims_. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 (and, at the option of any Indemnitee,
any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based
upon intentional misrepresentation or fraud, relating to this Agreement or the
Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively in
accordance with _Exhibit B_ being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt
and without limiting any portion of Section 10.8(b): (i) at the option of any
Indemnitee, any claim based upon intentional misrepresentation or fraud may
be brought and resolved in accordance with Section 10.8(b) rather than in
accordance with _Exhibit B_ ; and (ii) nothing in this Section 10.8(c) shall
prevent Parent from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction).

10.9 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon: (a) the
Company and its successors and assigns (if any); (b) Parent and its successors
and assigns (if any); and (c) Merger Sub and its successors and assigns (if

performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other provision; and (ii) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach; and (b) such other party shall not be

55\. 10.11 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived
any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not
be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it
is given.

10.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES

Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 10.8(c) of the Agreement: (i)
until the earlier of the termination of the Escrow Agreement or the time at
which the aggregate amount of the claims made by the Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 9 of the Agreement exceed the Escrow Amount (such time being referred
to as the " _Direct Claim Time_ "), any claim for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 of the Agreement (and, at
the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as
in the case of a claim based upon intentional misrepresentation or fraud,
relating to the Agreement or the Merger after the Closing) shall be brought
and resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Escrow Agreement; and (ii) from and after the Direct Claim Time, any claim
for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 of
the Agreement (and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a
monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon intentional
misrepresentation or fraud, relating to the Agreement or the Merger after the
Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively as follows:

(a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or suffered
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under Section 9 of the Agreement or for which it is or may
otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement or the
Merger, such Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to
the Stockholders Agent. Each Claim Notice shall: (i) state that the
Indemnitee believes in good faith that the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 of
the Agreement or is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy
relating to the Agreement or the Merger; (ii) contain a brief description of
the facts and circumstances supporting the Indemnitees claim; and (iii) if
practicable, contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the
amount to which the Indemnitee claims to be entitled (the aggregate amount of
such estimate, as it may be modified by the Indemnitee in good faith from time
to time, being referred to as the " _Claimed Amount_ ").

(b) During the 20-business day period commencing upon receipt by the
Stockholders Agent of a Claim Notice from an Indemnitee (the "Dispute
Period"), the Stockholders Agent may deliver to the Indemnitee a written
response (the "Response Notice") in which the Stockholders Agent: (i) agrees
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that
part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii)
indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. If the
Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause "(ii)" or "(iii)" of
the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief
description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Stockholders
Agents claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to
the Indemnitee, as the case may be (any part of the Claimed Amount that is not
agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Indemnitees Claim Notice
being referred to as the " _Contested Amount_ "). If a Response Notice is not
received by the Indemnitee from the Stockholders Agent prior to the
expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Stockholders Agent shall be
conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the full Claimed
Amount is owed to the Indemnitee.

(c) If the Stockholders Agent in its Response Notice agrees that the full
Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, or if no Response Notice is received
by the Indemnitee from the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the
Dispute Period, the Indemnitors shall, within 10 business days following the
earlier of the delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the
Dispute Period, pay (and the Stockholders Agent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Indemnitors to pay) the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnitee. (d) If the Stockholders Agent in the Response Notice agrees that part, but
not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee (the " _Agreed
Amount_ "), the Indemnitors shall, within 10 business days following the
delivery of such Response Notice, pay (and the Stockholders Agent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Indemnitors to pay) the Agreed
Amount to the Indemnitee.

(e) If any Response Notice expressly indicates that there is a Contested
Amount, the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Stockholders
Agent and the Indemnitee resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be
binding on the Stockholders Agent, the Indemnitors and such Indemnitee and a
settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Indemnitee (the "
_Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be signed by such Indemnitee and
the Stockholders Agent. The Indemnitors shall, within 10 business days
following the execution of such settlement agreement, or such shorter period
of time as may be set forth in the settlement agreement, pay (and the
Stockholders Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Indemnitors to pay) the Stipulated Amount to the Indemnitee.

(f) In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Claim Notice or
Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between the Indemnitee, on the one
hand, and the Stockholders Agent, on the other hand, or it is a matter that
is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by a third
party brought against the Indemnitee or the Company in a litigation or
arbitration), such dispute (an " _Arbitrable Dispute_ ") shall be settled by
binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this
_Exhibit B_ shall prevent the Indemnitee from seeking preliminary injunctive
relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any
Arbitrable Dispute.

(i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance with JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _JAMS Rules_ ") then in
effect. However, in all events, the provisions contained herein shall govern
over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the
JAMS Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be
entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies
that would be available if any judicial proceeding was instituted to resolve
an Arbitrable Dispute. The final decision of the arbitrator, as entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction, will be furnished by the arbitrator to
the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee in writing and will constitute a
final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue in question,
binding upon the Stockholders Agent, the Indemnitors and the Indemnitee, and
an order with respect thereto may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the
Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent or by JAMS, but based upon reasonable
hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties
are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Indemnitee and the
Stockholders Agent. In the event the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent
are unable to agree within 20 business days following submission of the
dispute to JAMS by one of the parties, JAMS will have the authority to select
an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in
clause "(iv)" hereof. (iv) No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or
other relationship with the Indemnitee, the Company, the Stockholders Agent,
any of the Indemnitors or any "affiliate" (as such term is defined in Rule
12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")),
director or officer thereof, unless following full disclosure of all such
relationships, the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent agree in writing to
waive such requirement with respect to an individual in connection with
any dispute.

(v) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold up to five eight hour, one day
hearings regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his designation and
to render a written award, including a written opinion, no later than 10
business days after the conclusion of such hearing, in each case unless
otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders
Agent.

(vi) The Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent (on behalf of
the Indemnitors) will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to
the arbitrator in any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and
other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration proceedings; _provided,
however,_ that: (A) the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled
to an award of attorneys fees and costs; and (B) all costs of arbitration,
other than those provided for above, will be paid by the losing party, and the
arbitrator will be authorized to determine the identity of the prevailing
party and the losing party.

(vii) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have
the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or any other provisions contained in this _Exhibit B_ or the
Agreement.

(viii) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this _Exhibit B_ or the
Agreement, arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties
for any Arbitrable Dispute or any other dispute arising out of or relating to
this _Exhibit B_ or the Agreement.

(g) Upon resolution of the arbitration described in clause "(f)" of this
_Exhibit B_ , the Indemnitors shall, within 10 business days following the
entry of the arbitrators decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, or
such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the arbitrators decision,
pay (and the Stockholders Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Indemnitors to pay) the amount of the award specified in the
arbitrators decision, if any, to the Indemnitee. EXHIBIT C
