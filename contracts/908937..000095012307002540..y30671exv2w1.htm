  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of February 19, 2007  (this "
_Agreement_ ") is by and among Sirius  Satellite Radio Inc., a Delaware
corporation  (" _Sirius_ "), Vernon Merger Corporation, a  Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of  Sirius (" _Merger
Co_."), and XM Satellite Radio  Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _XM_
"). 

  



  

   _WITNESSETH_ :   

  



  

  WHEREAS, each of the respective Boards of Directors of Sirius,  Merger Co.
and XM has approved, and deemed it advisable and in  the best interests of
its stockholders to consummate, the  business combination transaction
provided for herein, including  the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Co.
with  and into XM in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "),  and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth  herein; 

  



  

  WHEREAS, Sirius and XM intend the Merger to qualify as a  reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and  regulations promulgated thereunder (the  "
_Code_ "); and 

  



  

  WHEREAS, Sirius and XM desire to make certain representations, 
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the  Merger and also
to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  



  

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the  respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements  set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows: 

        ARTICLE I 
           The Merger           1.1 __Effective Time of 
Merger_._ Subject to the provisions of this  Agreement, a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of  Merger_ ") shall be duly prepared, executed by
XM and  thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of 
Delaware for filing, as provided in the DGCL, on the Closing  Date (as
defined in Section 1.2). The Merger shall become  effective upon the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the  Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such time  thereafter as is agreed upon in writing by Sirius
and XM and  provided in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective  Time_
"). 

       1.2 __Closing_._ The closing  of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place  at 10:00 a.m. on the date (the " _Closing  Date_ ") that is
the second business day after the  satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the  conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding
conditions  that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date 
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions),  unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the  parties hereto. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of  Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425
Lexington Avenue,  New York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed
to in  writing by the parties hereto. 

       1.3 __Effects of the  Merger_._ At the Effective Time, Merger
Co.  shall be merged with and into XM and the separate existence of  Merger
Co. shall cease and XM shall continue as the surviving  corporation in the
Merger. The Merger will have the effects set  forth in the DGCL. As used in
this Agreement,  " _Constituent Corporations_ " shall mean each of  Merger
Co. and XM, and " _Surviving Corporation_ "  shall mean XM, at and after the
Effective Time, as the surviving  corporation in the Merger. 

       1.4 __Certificate of  Incorporation_._ At the Effective Time,
the  certificate of incorporation of XM as in effect immediately  prior to
the Effective Time shall be the certificate of  incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter  changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable law. 

       1.5 __By-Laws_._ At the  Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger
Co. as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-
laws of  the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as 
provided therein or by applicable law. 

       1.6 __Officers and Directors of Surviving  Corporation_._ The
officers of XM as of the  Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving  Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal 
or otherwise ceasing to be 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  an officer or until their respective successors are duly elected  and
qualified, as the case may be. The directors of Merger Co.  as of the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving  Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or  otherwise ceasing to be a
director or until their respective  successors are duly elected and
qualified. 

        ARTICLE II 
           Effects of  the Merger           2.1 __Effect on
Capital  Stock_._ At the Effective Time, by virtue  of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder  of any shares of the XM Common
Stock: 

  



  

  (a) __Cancellation of Treasury  Stock_._ All shares of Class A common 
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of XM (the " _XM  Common Stock_ ") and
shares of Series A Convertible  Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of XM (the  " _XM Series A Preferred Stock_" and,  together with the XM
Common Stock, the " _XM Merger  Stock_ ") that are owned by XM as treasury
stock shall be  canceled and shall cease to exist, and no shares of common 
stock, par value $.001 per share, of Sirius (the  " _Sirius Common Stock_ ")
or other consideration  shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  



  

  (b) __Conversion of the XM Common  Stock_._ Subject to Section 2.3, each 
share of the XM Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be  canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(a),  (ii) shares owned by Sirius immediately prior to the 
Effective Time, which shares shall be cancelled and  extinguished, and (iii)
shares owned by any direct or  indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined
in  Section 3.1(a)(i)) of Sirius or any direct or indirect  wholly-owned
Subsidiary of XM immediately prior to the Effective  Time, which shares shall
remain outstanding) shall be canceled  and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to  receive 4.60 (the " _Common Exchange Ratio_ ") 
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Sirius Common Stock  (together with
any cash paid in respect of fractional shares in  accordance with Section
2.3, the " _Common Merger  Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, all such
shares  of the XM Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall 
automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to  exist, and
each certificate previously representing any such  shares shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the  Common Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares upon the  surrender of the certificate representing
such shares in  accordance with Section 2.2 (or in the case of a lost, 
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit  (and bond, if
required) in the manner provided in  Section 2.4). The Common Exchange Ratio
shall be  appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock 
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any  dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Sirius  Common Stock or XM Common
Stock), reorganization,  recapitalization, reclassification or other like
change with  respect to Sirius Common Stock or XM Common Stock having a 
record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the  Effective Time. 

  



  

  (c) __Conversion of XM Series A Preferred  Stock_._ Each share of the XM
Series A  Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be canceled in  accordance with
Section 2.1(a), (ii) shares owned by  Sirius immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which shares  shall be cancelled and extinguished, (iii)
shares owned by  any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sirius or
any  direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of XM immediately  prior to
the Effective Time, which shares shall remain  outstanding, and (iv) shares
held by holders who have  properly demanded and perfected (and not withdrawn
or lost)  appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with  Section
262 of the DGCL) shall be canceled and extinguished  and automatically
converted into the right to receive 4.60 (the  " _Preferred Exchange Ratio_
") fully paid and  nonassessable shares of a newly-designated series of
Sirius  Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 3.2(b)) (the  " _Sirius
Mirror Preferred Stock_ ") having the  same powers, designations,
preferences, rights and  qualifications, limitations and restrictions (to the
fullest  extent practicable) as the shares of XM Series A Preferred  Stock
so converted, except that the holders thereof shall be  entitled to vote,
together with the holders of the shares of  Sirius Common Stock (and any
other class or series that may  similarly be entitled to vote with the shares
of Sirius Common  Stock) as a single class, upon all matters upon which
holders of  Sirius Common Stock are entitled to vote, with each share of 
Sirius Preferred Stock entitled to 1/5th of one vote on  such matters (the "
_Preferred Merger  Consideration_ " and, together with the Common Merger 
Consideration, 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such  conversion, all such shares of
the XM Series A Preferred  Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be  canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and
each  certificate previously representing any such shares shall  thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Preferred  Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares upon the  surrender of the certificate representing
such shares in  accordance with Section 2.2 (or in the case of a lost, 
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit  (and bond, if
required) in the manner provided in  Section 2.4). The Preferred Exchange
Ratio shall be  appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock  split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any  dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into XM  Series A Preferred Stock,
XM Common Stock or Sirius Common  Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or  other like change with respect to XM Series A
Preferred  Stock, XM Common Stock or Sirius Common Stock having a record 
date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (d) __Merger Co. Capital Stock_._ Each  share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger  Co. outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be  automatically converted into and become one fully
paid and  non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving 
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such  shares of common
stock of Merger Co. shall thereafter evidence  ownership of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

       2.2 __Surrender and  Payment_._ (a) Sirius shall appoint an 
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably  acceptable to XM for the purpose
of exchanging certificates  which immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced shares  of XM Merger Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") for the 
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to an exchange agent  agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to XM.  At or as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within two  (2) business days) after the
Effective Time, Sirius shall  deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange  Agent, the Merger Consideration to be exchanged or paid in 
accordance with this Article II, and Sirius shall make  available from time
to time after the Effective Time as  necessary, cash in an amount sufficient
to pay any cash payable  in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3
and  any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of XM  Merger
Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).  The Surviving Corporation
shall send, or shall cause the  Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record of shares of XM  Merger Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
whose  shares were converted into the right to receive the applicable 
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, promptly  after the Effective
Time, (i) a letter of transmittal for  use in such exchange (which shall be
in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Sirius and XM and shall
specify that  the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title in 
respect of the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper  delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and  (ii) instructions to effect the
surrender of the  Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger 
Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any  fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends  or other distributions
payable in respect thereof pursuant to  Section 2.2(c). 

  



  

  (b) Each holder of shares of XM Merger Stock that have been  converted
into a right to receive the applicable Merger  Consideration, cash payable in
respect thereof in lieu of any  fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and
any dividends  or other distributions payable in respect thereof pursuant
to  Section 2.2(c), upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a  Certificate
or Certificates, together with a properly completed  letter of transmittal
covering such shares and such other  documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, shall be  entitled to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration payable  in respect of such shares of XM Merger Stock. The
holder of such  Certificate, upon its delivery thereof to the Exchange
Agent,  shall also receive any dividends or other distributions to which 
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash  payable in
respect of any fractional shares pursuant to  Section 2.3. Certificates
surrendered shall forthwith be  canceled as of the Effective Time. Until so
surrendered, each  such Certificate, following the Effective Time, shall
represent  for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable Merger 
Consideration, cash payable in respect thereof in lieu of any  fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends  or other distributions
payable in respect thereof pursuant to  Section 2.2(c). No interest shall be
paid or accrued for  the benefit of holders of the Certificates on cash
amounts  payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this 
Section 2.2. 

  



  

  (c) Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared  or made after
the date hereof with respect to Sirius Common  Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time, such  declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in  respect of all shares of Sirius Common Stock and Sirius
Mirror  Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No  dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the  Effective Time with
respect to Sirius 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall  be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with  respect to the Sirius
Common Stock or Sirius Mirror Preferred  Stock such holder is entitled to
receive until the holder of  such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance  with the provisions of this Section 2.2. Subject
to  applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate,  there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates  representing whole
Sirius Common Stock and Sirius Mirror  Preferred Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest,  at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other  distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time  theretofore paid with respect to such whole Sirius Common Stock  and
Sirius Mirror Preferred Stock. 

  



  

  (d) In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of  XM Merger
Stock is not registered in the stock transfer  books or ledger of XM, or if
any certificate for the applicable  Merger Consideration is to be issued in a
name other than that  in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is  registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance thereof
that  the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly 
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that  the Person
requesting such exchange shall have paid to the  Exchange Agent any transfer
or other taxes required as a result  of the issuance of a certificate for
Sirius Common Stock or  Sirius Mirror Preferred Stock in any name other than
that of the  registered holder of such shares of XM Merger Stock, or 
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such  tax has been
paid or is not payable. For purposes of this  Agreement, " _Person_ " means
an individual, a  corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership,
an  association, a trust or any other entity or organization,  including a
government or political subdivision or any agency or  instrumentality
thereof. 

  



  

  (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further  registration of
transfers of shares of XM Merger Stock. If,  after the Effective Time, any
Certificate formerly representing  shares of XM Merger Stock is presented to
the Surviving  Corporation, it shall be canceled and exchanged for the 
applicable Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance  with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II. 

  



  

  (f) None of Sirius, Merger Co., XM or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be liable to any  holder of shares of XM
Merger Stock for any Merger  Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any  applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  



  

  (g) Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation  and Sirius
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the  Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of shares  of XM Merger Stock, and from any
cash dividends or other  distributions that the holder is entitled to receive
under  Section 2.2(c), such amounts as the Exchange Agent, the  Surviving
Corporation or Sirius is required to deduct and  withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the  Code, or any provision of United States 
(" _U.S._ ") federal, state or local tax law or any  other  non-U.S. tax 
law or any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent  that amounts
are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the  Surviving Corporation or Sirius,
such amounts withheld from the  Merger Consideration and other such amounts
payable under  Section 2.2(c) shall be treated for all purposes of this 
Agreement as having been received by the holder of the shares of  XM Merger
Stock in respect of which such deduction and  withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving  Corporation or Sirius. 

  



  

  (h) Any portion of the certificates evidencing the Sirius  Common Stock or
the Sirius Mirror Preferred Stock, the cash to  be paid in respect of
fractional shares pursuant to  Section 2.3, and the cash or other property in
respect of  dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) 
supplied to the Exchange Agent which remains unclaimed by the  holders of
shares of XM Merger Stock twelve  (12) months after the Effective Time shall
be returned to  Sirius, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged  his shares of XM Merger Stock for the applicable Merger 
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to  the time of
demand shall thereafter look only to Sirius for  payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration, and any cash  payable in respect thereof in lieu of any
fractional shares  pursuant to Section 2.3 and any dividends or
distributions  with respect to Sirius Common Stock to which they were
entitled  pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without interest. 

       2.3 __Fractional  Shares_._ No certificates representing less 
than one share of Sirius Common Stock shall be issued in  exchange for shares
of XM Common Stock upon the surrender  for exchange of a Certificate. In lieu
of any such fractional  share, each holder of shares of XM Common Stock who
would  otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Sirius 
Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange (or in  the case of
a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon  delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner  provided in 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  Section 2.4) shall be paid upon such surrender (and after  taking into
account and aggregating shares of XM Common  Stock represented by all
Certificates surrendered by such  holder) cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the  product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional
share  interest to which such holder (after taking into account and 
aggregating all shares of XM Common Stock represented by  all Certificates
surrendered by such holder) would otherwise be  entitled by (b) the closing
price for a share of Sirius  Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
on the last  trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.
Fractional  shares of Sirius Mirror Preferred Stock may be issued in 
exchange for shares of XM Series A Preferred Stock. 

       2.4 __Lost, Stolen or Destroyed  Certificates_._ In the event
any  Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the  Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or  destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that  fact by the holder
thereof, the applicable Merger Consideration,  any cash payable in respect
thereof in lieu of any fractional  shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and any
dividends or other  distributions as may be required pursuant to this 
Article II in respect of the shares of XM Merger Stock  represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Sirius
may, in its  discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof,  require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates 
to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as  indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Sirius or  the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to  have been lost, stolen or
destroyed. 

       2.5 __Options and Other XM Stock  Awards_._ Prior to the
Effective Time, XM  and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to
ensure  that from and after the Effective Time, (x) options to  purchase
shares of the XM Common Stock (each, an  " _XM Option_ ") held by any
employee, consultant,  independent contractor and director and (y) other
awards  based on XM Common Stock (collectively with the XM Options,  the "
_XM Stock Awards_ ") held by any employee,  consultant, independent
contractor and director which are  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be  converted into and become, respectively, (x) options
to  purchase shares of Sirius Common Stock (each, a  " _Converted Option_ ")
and, (y) with respect  to all other XM Stock Awards, awards based on shares
of Sirius  Common Stock (the " _Converted Stock Awards_ " and,  together
with the Converted Options, the " _Converted  Equity Awards_ "), in each
case, on terms substantially  identical to those in effect immediately prior
to the Effective  Time under the terms of the stock incentive plan or other 
related agreement or award pursuant to which such XM Stock  Award was
granted; _provided_ , _however_ , that from  and after the Effective Time,
(i) each such Converted  Option may be exercised solely to purchase shares of
Sirius  Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Sirius Common  Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Converted Option shall be  equal to the number
of shares of the XM Common Stock that  were issuable upon exercise under the
corresponding  XM Option immediately prior to the Effective Time  multiplied
by the Common Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the  nearest whole share,
(iii) the per share exercise price  under such Converted Option shall be
determined by dividing the  per share exercise price of the corresponding XM
Option  immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Common Exchange 
Ratio and rounded up to the nearest whole cent, (iv) the  number of shares of
Sirius Common Stock subject to such  Converted Stock Awards shall be
determined by multiplying the  number of the shares of XM Common Stock
subject to the  corresponding XM Stock Award immediately prior to the 
Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio and rounded down to  the nearest
whole share, (v) to the extent that the  transfer of shares of XM Common
Stock issuable upon  exercise of any XM Option (or issued in connection with
any  previously exercised XM Option) is conditioned upon the  fair market

shares of Sirius Common Stock  (each, a " _Converted Warrant_ ") on terms 
substantially identical to those in effect immediately prior to  the
Effective Time under the terms of the warrant or other  related agreement or
award pursuant to which such XM Warrant was  granted; _provided_ , _however_
, that, subject to the  terms of the XM Warrants, from and after the
Effective  Time, (i) each such Converted Warrant may be exercised  solely to
purchase shares of Sirius Common Stock, (ii) the  number of shares of Sirius
Common Stock issuable upon exercise  of such Converted Warrant shall be equal
to the number of shares  of the XM Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise under  the corresponding XM Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective  Time multiplied by the Common Exchange Ratio and rounded down to 
the nearest whole share and (iii) the per share exercise  price under such
Converted Warrant shall be determined by  dividing the per share exercise
price of the corresponding XM  Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Common  Exchange Ratio and rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.

" _Governmental Entity_ ") is required by or with  respect to XM or any
Subsidiary of XM in connection with the  execution and delivery of this
Agreement by XM or the  consummation by XM of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the  failure to make or obtain which, individually or in the

effect on XM or (y) prevent, delay or  impede XMs ability to perform its
obligations hereunder or  to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for  (A) the filing with the SEC of the Joint Proxy

(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to  the date hereof, as of
the date of such filing), the XM SEC  Documents complied in all material
respects with the  requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the  case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder 
applicable to such XM SEC Documents, and none of the XM SEC  Documents when
filed contained any untrue statement of a  material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in  light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not  misleading. The financial statements of XM included in the XM 
SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates  of filing

respect thereto (except, in the  case of unaudited statements, as permitted

present in all material respects the consolidated  financial position of XM
and its consolidated Subsidiaries and  the consolidated results of
operations, changes in  stockholders equity and cash flows of such companies

comments from the Staff of the SEC with respect to any of the XM  SEC
Documents.

or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a material adverse
effect on XM,  (D) liabilities incurred pursuant to the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, and (E) liabilities or  obligations
discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this  Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with  past practice, XM and its
Subsidiaries do not have, and since  September 30, 2006, XM and its
Subsidiaries have not  incurred (except as permitted by Section 4.1), any 
liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether  accrued,
absolute, matured, determined, contingent or otherwise  and whether or not
required to be reflected in XMs  financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted  accounting principles). 

  



  

  (e) __Compliance with Applicable Laws and Reporting  Requirements_._ (i)
XM and its  Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, 
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are  material to the
operation of the businesses of XM and its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(the " _XM  Permits_ "), and XM and its Subsidiaries are and have  been in
compliance with the terms of the XM Permits and all  applicable laws and
regulations and their own privacy policies,  including the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended, and the  rules, regulations and published decisions,
orders, rulings and  notices of the FCC (the " _Communications Laws_ "), 
except where the failure so to hold or comply, individually or  in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a  material adverse
effect on XM. 

  



  

  (ii) The businesses of XM and its Subsidiaries are not  being and have not
been conducted in violation of any law,  ordinance or regulation of any
Governmental Entity (including  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
Communications Laws),  except for possible violations which, individually or
in the  aggregate, do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to 
have, a material adverse effect on XM. 

  



  

  (iii) XM and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a  system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined  in  Rules
13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f) of  the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the  preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. XM  (A) has
designed and maintains disclosure controls and  procedures (as defined in 
Rules 13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e) of  the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information required  to be disclosed by XM in the reports that it
files or submits  under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and  reported within the time periods specified in the SECs  rules and
forms and is accumulated and communicated to XMs  management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding  required disclosure, and (B) has
disclosed, based on its  most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls
and  procedures prior to the date hereof, to XMs auditors and  the audit
committee of XMs Board of Directors (1) any  significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design  or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which  are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material  respect XMs ability to record, process, summarize and  report
financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or  not material, that
involves management or other employees who  have a significant role in XMs
internal controls over  financial reporting. 

  



  

  (f) __Legal Proceedings_._ There is no  claim, suit, action, litigation,
arbitration, investigation or  other demand or proceeding (whether judicial,
arbitral,  administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of XM, 
threatened, against or affecting XM or any Subsidiary of XM as  to which
there is a significant possibility of an adverse  outcome which would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a  material adverse effect on XM, nor
is there any judgment,  decree, injunction, rule, award, settlement,
stipulation or  order of or subject to any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator  outstanding against XM or any Subsidiary of XM having or which 
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a
material adverse effect on XM. To the knowledge of  XM, no investigation by
any Governmental Entity with respect to  XM or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or threatened, other  than, in each case, those the outcome of which,
individually or  in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
a  material adverse effect on XM. 

  



  

  (g) __Taxes_._ XM and each of its  Subsidiaries have filed all material
tax returns required to be  filed by any of them and have paid (or XM has
paid on their  behalf) all taxes shown as due on such returns, and the most 
recent financial statements contained in the XM SEC Documents  reflect an
adequate reserve, in accordance with generally  accepted accounting
principles, for all taxes payable by XM and  its Subsidiaries accrued 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  through the date of such financial statements. No material  deficiencies
or other claims for any taxes have been proposed,  asserted or assessed
against XM or any of its Subsidiaries that  are not adequately reserved for.
For the purpose of this  Agreement, the term " _tax_ " (including, with 
correlative meaning, the terms " _taxes_ " and  " _taxable_ ") shall mean (i)
all Federal,  state, local and foreign income, profits, franchise, gross 
receipts, payroll, sales, employment, use, property,  withholding, excise,
occupancy and other taxes, duties or  assessments of any nature whatsoever,
together with all  interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to
such  amounts, (ii) liability for the payment of any amounts of  the type
described in clause (i) as a result of being or  having been a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or  unitary group, and (iii) liability for
the payment of any  amounts as a result of being party to any tax sharing
agreement  or as a result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify 
any other person with respect to the payment of any amounts of  the type
described in clause (i) or (ii). Neither XM nor  any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action or knows of any  fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance
that could  reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as 
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of  the Code. 

  



  

  (h) __Certain Agreements_._ Except as  disclosed in or filed as exhibits
to the XM SEC Documents filed  prior to the date of this Agreement and except
for this  Agreement, neither XM nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to 
or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or  understanding (i) with
respect to the service of any  directors, officers, employees, or independent
contractors or  consultants that are natural persons, involving the payment
of  $10 million or more in any 12 month period,  (ii) which is a "material
contract" (as such term  is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of  Regulation S-K 
of the SEC), (iii) which limits the ability of XM or any of  its Subsidiaries
to compete in any line of business, in any  geographic area or with any
person, or which requires referrals  of business and, in each case, which
limitation or requirement  would reasonably be expected to be material to XM
and its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) with or to a labor  union or
guild (including any collective bargaining agreement),  (v) which is a
significant contract, arrangement or  understanding with an automobile
manufacturer, (vi) which  is a contract, arrangement or understanding with a
content  provider involving the payment of $10 million or more in  any 12
month period, or (vii) which would prevent,  delay or impede the
consummation, or otherwise reduce the  contemplated benefits, of any of the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. XM has previously made
available to Sirius or  its representatives complete and accurate copies of
each  contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type 
described in this Section 3.1(h) (collectively referred to  herein as the "
_XM Contracts_ "). All of the XM  Contracts are valid and in full force and
effect, except to the  extent they have previously expired in accordance with
their  terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect,  individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be  expected to have a material
adverse effect on XM. Neither XM nor  any of its Subsidiaries has, or is
alleged to have, and to the  knowledge of XM, none of the other parties

comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not  reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on  Sirius. 

  



  

  (ii) The businesses of Sirius and its Subsidiaries are not  being and have
not been conducted in violation of any law,  ordinance or regulation of any
Governmental Entity (including  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
Communications Laws),  except for possible violations which, individually or
in the  aggregate, do not have, and would not reasonably be expected to 
have, a material adverse effect on Sirius. 

  



  

  (iii) Sirius and its Subsidiaries have designed and  maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting  (as defined in  Rules
13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f) of  the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the  preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Sirius  (A) has
designed and maintains disclosure controls and  procedures (as defined in 
Rules 13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e) of  the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information required  to be disclosed by Sirius in the reports that
it files or  submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, 
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the  SECs rules
and forms and is accumulated and communicated  to Siriuss management as
appropriate to allow timely  decisions regarding required disclosure, and (B)
has  disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such  disclosure
controls and procedures prior to the date hereof, to  Siriuss auditors and
the audit committee of Siriuss  Board of Directors (1) any significant
deficiencies and  material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal  controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to 
adversely affect in any material respect Siriuss ability  to record,
process, summarize and report financial information  and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves  management or other employees who
have a significant role in  Siriuss internal controls over financial
reporting.

  (f) __Legal Proceedings_._ There is no  claim, suit, action, litigation,
arbitration, investigation or  other demand or proceeding (whether judicial,
arbitral,  administrative or other) pending or, to the knowledge of Sirius, 
threatened, against or affecting Sirius or any Subsidiary of  Sirius as to
which there is a significant possibility of an  adverse outcome which would,
individually or in the aggregate,  have a material adverse effect on Sirius,
nor is there any  judgment, decree, injunction, rule, award, settlement, 
stipulation or order of or subject to any Governmental Entity or  arbitrator
outstanding against Sirius or any Subsidiary of  Sirius having, or which
would reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on  Sirius. To the knowledge of Sirius, no
investigation by any  Governmental Entity with respect to Sirius or any of
its  Subsidiaries is pending or threatened, other than, in each case,  those
the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate,  would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse  effect on Sirius. 

  



  

  (g) __Taxes_._ Sirius and each of its  Subsidiaries have filed all
material tax returns required to be  filed by any of them and have paid (or
Sirius has paid on their  behalf) all taxes shown as due on such returns, and
the most  recent financial statements contained in the Sirius SEC  Documents
reflect an adequate reserve, in accordance with  generally accepted
accounting principles, for all taxes payable  by Sirius and its Subsidiaries
accrued through the date of such  financial statements. No material
deficiencies or other claims  for any taxes have been proposed, asserted or
assessed against  Sirius or any of its Subsidiaries that are not adequately 
reserved for. Neither Sirius nor any of its Subsidiaries has  taken any
action or knows of any fact, agreement or plan or  other circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent  the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the  meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  



  

  (h) __Certain Agreements_._ Except as  disclosed in or filed as exhibits
to the Sirius SEC Documents  filed prior to the date of this Agreement and
except for this  Agreement, neither Sirius nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party  to or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or 
understanding (i) with respect to the service of any  directors, officers,
employees, or independent contractors or  consultants that are natural
persons, involving the payment of  $10 million or more in any 12 month
period,  (ii) which is a "material contract" (as such term  is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of  Regulation S-K  of the SEC), (iii) which limits the
ability of Sirius or  any of its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of
business, in  any geographic area or with any person, or which requires 
referrals of business and, in each case, which limitation or  requirement
would reasonably be expected to be material to  Sirius and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (iv) with or  to a labor union or guild (including any
collective bargaining  agreement), (v) which is a significant contract, 
arrangement or understanding with an automobile manufacturer,  (vi) which is
a contract, arrangement or understanding with  a content provider involving

would  prevent, delay or impede the consummation, or otherwise reduce  the
contemplated benefits, of any of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement. Sirius has previously made  available to XM or its representatives
complete and accurate  copies of each contract, arrangement, commitment or 
understanding of the type described in this Section 3.2(h)  (collectively
referred to herein as " _Sirius  Contracts_ "). All of the Sirius Contracts
are valid and  in full force and effect, except to the extent they have 
previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the  failure to be in
full force and effect, individually or in the  aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect on Sirius. Neither
Sirius nor any of its  Subsidiaries has, or is alleged to have, and to the
knowledge of  Sirius, none of the other parties thereto have, violated any 
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no  event or
condition exists, which, with or without notice, lapse  of time or both would
constitute a default under the provisions  of, any Sirius Contract, except in
each case for those  violations and defaults which, individually or in the
aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
adverse  effect on Sirius. 

  



  

  (i) __Benefit  Plans_._ (i) Section 3.2(i) of the  Sirius Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list  of each material Sirius Benefit
Plan. A " _Sirius Benefit  Plan_ " is a Benefit Plan (x) maintained,
entered  into or contributed to by Sirius or any of its Subsidiaries  under
which any present or former employee, director,  independent contractor or
consultant of Sirius or any of its  Subsidiaries has any present or future
right to benefits or  (y) under which Sirius or any of its Subsidiaries
could  reasonably be expected to have any present or future liability.  No
Sirius Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or  Title IV of ERISA of
section 412 of the Code. 

  



  

  (ii) With respect to each material Sirius Benefit Plan,  Sirius has made
available to XM a current, accurate and complete  copy thereof, and, to the

  (iii) With respect to the Sirius Benefit Plans,  individually and in the
aggregate, no event has occurred and, to  the knowledge of Sirius, there
exists no condition or set of  circumstances in connection with which Sirius
or any of its  Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would 
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on  Sirius under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law. 

  



  

  (iv) No Sirius Benefit Plan exists that could result in the  payment to
any person of any money or other property or  accelerate or provide any other
rights or benefits to any person  as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  whether alone or in connection with any
other event, and whether  or not such payment would constitute a parachute
payment within  the meaning of Code Section 280G. 

  



  

  (v) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a  material adverse
effect on Sirius or any of its Subsidiaries,  (A) no liability under Title IV
or section 302 of  ERISA has been incurred by Sirius, or by any trade or
business,  whether or not incorporated, that together with Sirius would be 
deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of  section 4001(b) of ERISA (a
" _Sirius ERISA  Affiliate_ "), that has not been satisfied in full, and 
(B) no condition exists that presents a risk to Sirius or  any Sirius ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability.

material  adverse effect on Sirius. All of the shares of capital stock of

mutually acceptable proxy materials  which shall constitute the proxy
statement/prospectus relating  to the matters to be submitted to the XM
stockholders at the XM  Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(b))
and to  the Sirius stockholders at the Sirius Stockholders Meeting (as 
defined in Section 5.1(c)) (such joint proxy  statement/prospectus, and any
amendments or supplements thereto,  the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_
"), and  Sirius shall prepare, together with XM, and file with the SEC a 
registration statement on  Form S-4  (of which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall be a part)  with respect to the issuance of Sirius

  (ii) Each of Sirius and XM shall use reasonable best  efforts to have the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by  the SEC and the  Form S-4 
declared effective by the SEC, to keep the  Form S-4  effective as long as
is necessary to consummate the Merger and  the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and to mail the  Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
their respective  stockholders as promptly as practicable after the  Form
S-4  is declared effective. Sirius and XM shall, as promptly as  practicable
after receipt thereof, provide the other party with  copies of any written
comments and advise the other party of any  oral comments with respect to the
Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus or  Form S-4  received from the SEC. Each

such filings made with the  SEC. 

  



  

  (iii) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by  XM or Sirius
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the  (A) Form S-4  will, at
the time the  Form S-4  is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes

material  fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated 
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not  misleading, and the
(B) Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus  will, at the date of mailing to
stockholders and at the times of  the meetings of stockholders to be held in
connection with the  Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit  to state any material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of  the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in  all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act  and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder, except that  no representation or warranty shall be made by
either such party  with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference  therein based on information supplied by the other party for 
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus or  Form S-4.

Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange  Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Sirius shall use  its reasonable best efforts to take

notice thereof, of the time when the  Form S-4  has become effective, the
issuance of any stop order, the  suspension of the qualification of the
Sirius Common Stock  issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in  any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the 
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the  Form S-4.  If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information  relating to either of the parties, or
their respective  affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered
by  either party which should be set forth in an amendment or  supplement to
any of the  Form S-4  or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such
documents  would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to 
state any material fact necessary to make the statements  therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were  made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information  shall promptly notify the other party
hereto and, to the extent  required by law, rules or regulations, an
appropriate amendment  or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly  filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of XM  and
Sirius. 

  



  

  (vi) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no  amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by  reference) to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the  Form S-4  shall be made without the approval of
XM and Sirius, which  approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed;  _provided_ that XM, in connection with a Change in XM 
Recommendation, and Sirius, in connection with a Change in  Sirius
Recommendation, may amend or supplement the proxy  statement for XM, the
proxy statement for Sirius or the  Form S-4  (including by incorporation by
reference) pursuant to a  Qualifying Amendment to effect or reflect such
change, and in  such event, the right of approval set forth in this  Section
5.1(a)(vi) shall not apply to such Qualifying  Amendment; _provided_ that the
right of approval shall  continue to apply with respect to such information
relating to  the other party or its business, financial condition or

statement for XM,  the proxy statement for Sirius or the  Form S-4 
(including by incorporation by reference) which effects or  reflects a Change
in XM Recommendation or a Change in Sirius  Recommendation (as the case may
be); provided that any such  amendment or supplement is limited to (A) a
Change in XM  Recommendation or a Change in Sirius Recommendation (as the
case  may be), (B) a discussion of the reasons of the Board of  Directors of
XM or Sirius (as the case may be) for making such  Change in XM
Recommendation or Change in Sirius Recommendation  (as the case may be) and

stockholders in  accordance with applicable legal requirements. The Board
of  Directors of XM shall include the XM Recommendation in the Joint  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and shall not (x) withdraw or  modify in any manner
adverse to Sirius, the XM Recommendation or  (y) publicly propose to, or
publicly announce that the  Board of Directors of XM has resolved to, take
any such action  (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in XM  Recommendation_
"), except as and to the extent expressly  permitted by Section 5.4(b).
Notwithstanding any Change in  XM Recommendation, unless earlier terminated
in accordance with  Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be submitted to the 
stockholders of XM at the XM Stockholders Meeting for the  purpose of
adopting this Agreement and nothing contained herein  shall be deemed to
relieve XM of such obligation.

expressly  permitted by Section 5.4(b). Notwithstanding any Change in 
Sirius Recommendation, unless earlier terminated in accordance  with Section
7.1, this Agreement shall be submitted to the  stockholders of Sirius at the

comprising the Required  Sirius Votes and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to  relieve Sirius of such obligation.

XM Stockholders Meeting and the Sirius  Stockholders Meeting to be held on
the same date. 

       5.2 __Access to Information;  Confidentiality.__ (a) Upon

entered  into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make

applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the  receipt of all such
consents, waivers, orders, approvals,  permits, rulings, authorizations and
clearances under such other  Applicable Antitrust Laws or from such
authorities as soon as  practicable. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in  this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.3  shall require, or be
deemed to require, (i) Sirius or XM  (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) to take 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  any action, agree to take any action or consent to the taking of  any
action (including with respect to selling, holding separate  or otherwise
disposing of any business or assets or conducting  its (or its Subsidiaries)
business in any specified  manner) if doing so would, individually or in the
aggregate,  reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
on  Sirius after the Effective Time, or (ii) Sirius or XM (or  any of their
respective Subsidiaries) to take any such action  that is not conditioned on
the consummation of the Merger.  Neither party shall take or agree to take
any action identified  in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence 
without the prior written consent of the other party. 

  



  

  (c) Each of Sirius and XM shall, in connection with the  efforts
referenced in Section 5.3(a), use its reasonable  best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each  other in connection with any filing or
submission and in  connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including  any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly 
inform the other party of the status of any of the matters  contemplated
hereby, including providing the other party with a  copy of any written
communication (or summary of oral  communications) received by such party

Justice,  the Federal Trade Commission, FCC or any other Governmental 
Entity and of any written communication (or summary of oral  communications)
received or given in connection with any  proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the  transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii)
to the extent  practicable, consult with each other in advance of any
meeting  or conference with any such Governmental Entity or, in  connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any such  other person, and to
the extent permitted by any such  Governmental Entity or other person, give
the other party the  opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and  conferences. 

  



  

  (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants  of the parties
contained in this Section 5.3, if  (i) any objections are asserted with
respect to the  transactions contemplated hereby under any law, rule, 
regulation, order or decree, (ii) any administrative or  judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be  instituted) by any
Governmental Entity or private party  challenging the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated  hereby as violative of any law, rule, regulation,
order or  decree or which would otherwise prevent, delay or impede the 
consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the contemplated  benefits, of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated  hereby, or (iii) any law,
rule, regulation, order or decree  is enacted, entered, promulgated or
enforced by a Governmental  Entity which would make the Merger or the other
transactions  contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prevent, delay
or  impede the consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the 
contemplated benefits, of the Merger or the other transactions  contemplated
hereby, then each of XM and Sirius shall use its  reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections, actions  or proceedings so as to permit the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
subject  to Section 5.3(b), selling, holding separate or otherwise 
disposing of or conducting its or its Subsidiaries  business or asset in a
specified manner, or agreeing to sell,  hold separate or otherwise dispose of
or conduct its or its  Subsidiaries business or assets in a specified
manner,  which would resolve such objections, actions or proceedings. 

  



  

  (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants  of the parties
contained in this Section 5.3, but subject  to first complying with the
obligations of Section 5.3(d),  if any of the events specified in Section
5.3(d)(ii) or  (iii) occurs, then each of Sirius and XM shall cooperate in 
all respects with each other and use its reasonable best  efforts, subject to
Section 5.3(b), to contest and resist  any such administrative or judicial
action or proceeding and to  have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
judgment,  injunction or other decree or order, whether temporary, 
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents,  materially
delays or materially impedes the consummation, or  otherwise materially
reduces the contemplated benefits, of the  Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  and to have such law, rule, regulation, order
or decree  repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  and each of
Sirius and XM shall use its reasonable best efforts  to defend, at its own
cost and expense, any such administrative  or judicial actions or
proceedings. 

  



  

  (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of  this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.3 shall limit a  partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as
such party has  otherwise complied with its obligations under this  Section
5.3 prior to such termination. 

  



  

  (g) Sirius shall agree to execute and deliver, at or prior  to the
Effective Time, supplemental indentures, loan amendments  and other

  outstanding debt, guarantees and other securities to the extent  required
by the terms of such debt, guarantees and securities  and the instruments and
agreements relating thereto, and XM  shall assist Sirius in accomplishing the
same. 

  



  

  (h) Each of XM and Sirius and their respective Boards of  Directors shall,
if any "moratorium," "control  share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover
law  or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger,  or any
other transactions contemplated hereby, use its  reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated  as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and  otherwise to minimize the effect of such law or
regulation on  this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby. 

  



  

  5.4 __Acquisition  Proposals_._ (a) Each of Sirius and XM  agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of  the officers and directors
of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and  that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and  its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
representatives  (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant 
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or  indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly  facilitate the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to,  or a transaction to effect, a merger,
reorganization, share  exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization,  liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
it or  any of its Significant Subsidiaries (other than any such  transaction
permitted by Section 4.1(e) or (f) in the  case of XM, and Section 4.2(e) or
(f) in the case of  Sirius) or any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the 
consolidated assets (including, without limitation, stock of its 
Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or  any purchase
or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its  voting securities that, if
consummated, would result in any  person (or the stockholders of such person)
beneficially owning  securities representing 15% or more of its total voting
power  (or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) of any  of
its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or  transaction (other
than a proposal or offer made by the other  party to this Agreement) being
hereinafter referred to as an  " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) have any 
discussions with or provide any confidential information or data  to any
person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in  any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or  knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement  an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or
recommend, or  propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into,
any  letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,  asset
purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or  other similar
agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal or  propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, either
party to this Agreement or its respective Board  of Directors shall be
permitted to (A) to the extent  applicable and being otherwise in compliance
with this  Section 5.4(b), comply with  Rule 14d-9  and  Rule 14e-2 
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition  Proposal,
or make any disclosure that the Board of Directors may  determine (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is  required to be made under
applicable law, (B) effect a  Change in XM Recommendation or a Change in
Sirius Recommendation  (as applicable, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), 
and (C) engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or  provide any
confidential information or data to, any person in  response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal by any such person first
made after the date of this  Agreement, if and only to the extent that, 

  



  

  (i) in any such case referred to in clause (B) or  (C) above, (I) such
partys Required Stockholders  Meeting shall not have occurred, (II) such
party has  complied in all material respects with this Section 5.4,  and
(III) its Board of Directors, after consultation with  its outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that failure  to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary  duties under applicable law, 

  



  

  (ii) in the case of clause (B) above,  (I) there has been a development,
event or occurrence after  the date of this Agreement (an " _Occurrence_ ")
as  a result of which the Board of Directors, after consultation  with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors,  determines in good faith that
failure to effect a Change in  Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties  under applicable law, (II) it has notified the other
party  to this Agreement, at least seven business days in advance of a  date
(in the case of a notification by XM, the " _Sirius  Election Date_ ", and in
the case of a notification by  Sirius, the " _XM Election Date_ ") of its 
intention to effect a Change in Recommendation (a  " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ "), and  furnished to the other party to this
Agreement any material  information possessed by it with respect to such
Occurrence 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  (including, if the Occurrence is the receipt of an Acquisition  Proposal
from a third party, the material terms and conditions  of such Acquisition
Proposal, the identity of the party making  such Acquisition Proposal and a
copy of any relevant proposed  transaction agreements with the party making
such Acquisition  Proposal and any other material documents received by it or
its  representatives in connection therewith), and (III) prior  to effecting
such a Change in Recommendation, it has (together  with its financial and
legal advisors) engaged in reasonable,  good faith negotiations with the
other party to this Agreement,  and has considered in good faith, after
consulting with its  financial and legal advisors, any modifications to the
terms and  conditions of this Agreement proposed by the other party hereto 
to determine whether such modifications cause the Board of  Directors to
conclude that such Occurrence no longer requires a  Change in
Recommendation; 

  



  

  (iii) in the case of clause (C) above, its Board  of Directors, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and  financial advisors, concludes in
good faith that there is a  reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes  or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, and  prior to providing any information or data to any person in 
connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, its  Board of
Directors receives from such person an executed  confidentiality agreement
having provisions that are no less  favorable to the party providing such
information than those  contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that  the provisions in such confidentiality agreement with
respect to  treatment of certain sensitive confidential information to 
ensure compliance with Applicable Antitrust Laws may differ due  to the
nature of the person or entity making such Acquisition  Proposal. 

  



  

  (c) Each of Sirius and XM shall notify the other party to  this Agreement
of any Acquisition Proposal received by, any  information related to an
Acquisition Proposal requested from,  or any discussions with or negotiations
by, it or any of its  representatives, indicating, in connection with such
notice, the  identity of such person and the material terms and conditions
of  any such Acquisition Proposal or request for information  (including a
copy thereof if in writing and any related  available documentation or
correspondence), and in any event  each of Sirius and XM shall provide
written notice to the other  party of any Acquisition Proposal, request for
information or  initiation of such discussions or negotiations within  48
hours of such event. Each of Sirius and XM agrees that  it will promptly keep
the other party informed of the status and  terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including whether  withdrawn or rejected), the status and nature of
all information  requested and delivered, and the status and terms of any
such  discussions or negotiations, and in any event each of Sirius and  XM
shall provide the other party with written notice of any  material
development thereto within 48 hours thereof. Each  of Sirius and XM also
agrees to provide the other party hereto  with copies of any written
information that it provides to the  third party making the request therefor
within 24 hours of  the time it provides such information to such third
party,  unless the other party hereto (i) has already been provided  with
such information or (ii) is restricted from receiving  such information to
ensure compliance with Applicable Antitrust  Laws; _provided_ that in such
case, such party shall inform  the other party of the type of information to
be provided to the  third party making the request. 

  



  

  (d) Each of Sirius and XM agrees that (i) it will and  will cause its
Subsidiaries, and its and their officers,  directors, agents, representatives
and advisors to, cease  immediately and terminate any and all existing
activities,  discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted 
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and  (ii) it will not
release any third party from, or waive any  provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to  which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to  any Acquisition Proposal. Each of
Sirius and XM agrees that it  will use reasonable best efforts to promptly
inform its and its  Subsidiaries respective directors, executive officers
and  financial and legal advisors of the obligations undertaken in  this
Section 5.4. Each party shall, if it has not already  done so, promptly
request, to the extent it has a contractual  right to do so, that each
person, if any, that has heretofore  executed a confidentiality agreement
within the six months prior  to the date of this Agreement in connection with
its  consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy  all
confidential information or data heretofore furnished to any  person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (e) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall (x) permit  either party to
terminate this Agreement or (y) affect any  other obligation of the parties
under this Agreement. Neither  party shall submit to the vote of its
stockholders any  Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to the 
termination of this Agreement. XM shall not amend, modify or  waive any
provision of the Rights Agreement, and shall not take  any action to redeem
the Rights or render the Rights  inapplicable to any transaction, other than
the Merger, prior to  any termination of this Agreement.

  (f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior  Proposal_ " means a bona
fide written Acquisition  Proposal which the Board of Directors of Sirius or
XM, as the  case may be, concludes in good faith, after consultation with 
its financial advisors and legal advisors, taking into account  the legal,
financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of  the proposal and the
person making the proposal (including any  break-up  fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to  consummation): (i) is more
favorable to the stockholders of  Sirius or XM, as the case may be, from a
financial point of  view, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  (after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and 
provisions of this Agreement committed to in writing by Sirius  or XM, as the
case may be, in response to such Acquisition  Proposal) and (ii) is fully
financed or reasonably capable  of being fully financed, reasonably likely to
receive all  required governmental approvals on a timely basis and
otherwise  reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; 
_provided_ that, for purposes of this definition of  "Superior Proposal," the
term Acquisition Proposal  shall have the meaning assigned to such term in 
Section 5.4(a), except that the reference to "15% or  more" in the definition
of "Acquisition Proposal"  shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority"
and  "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer  to a transaction
involving Sirius or XM, as the case may be. 

       5.5 __Affiliates_._ XM shall  use all reasonable efforts to cause
each person who is an  "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the 
Securities Act) to deliver to Sirius, as soon as reasonably  practicable and
in any event prior to the XM Stockholders  Meeting, a written agreement, in
form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to Sirius, relating to required
transfer  restrictions on the Sirius Common Stock received by them in the 
Merger pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities Act. 

       5.6 __Stock Exchange  Listing_._ Sirius shall use all
reasonable  efforts to cause (i) the shares of Sirius Common Stock to  be
issued in the Merger and (ii) the shares of Sirius  Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon the exercise,  vesting or payment under any
Converted Equity Award, to be  approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to
official notice of  issuance, prior to the Closing Date. 

       5.7 __Employee Benefit  Plans_._ Sirius and XM agree that,
except  as otherwise provided herein (including as set forth in  Section 5.7
of the XM Disclosure Schedule or  Section 5.7 of the Sirius Disclosure
Schedule, as  applicable) and unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing,
the  Sirius Benefit Plans and XM Benefit Plans in effect at the date  of
this Agreement shall remain in effect after the Effective  Time with respect
to employees covered by such plans at the  Effective Time, and the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to  formulate Benefit Plans for Sirius and its
Subsidiaries that,  following the formulation of such Benefit Plans, shall
provide  benefits for services on a similar basis to employees who were 
covered by the Sirius Benefit Plans and XM Benefit Plans  immediately prior
to the Effective Time. 

       5.8 __Section 16  Matters_._ Assuming that XM delivers to 
Sirius the Section 16 Information (as defined below)  reasonably in advance
of the Effective Time, the Board of  Directors of Sirius, or a committee of
Non-Employee Directors  thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of 
Rule 16b-3(d)  under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter  and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution 
providing that the receipt by the Insiders (as defined below) of  Sirius
Common Stock in exchange for shares of XM Common Stock,  the receipt of
Converted Options in exchange for XM Options, and  the receipt of Converted
Stock Awards in exchange for XM Stock  Awards, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated  hereby and to the extent such securities are
listed in the  Section 16 Information provided by XM to Sirius prior to  the
Effective Time, is intended to be exempt from liability  pursuant to Section
16(b) under the Exchange Act such that  any such receipt shall be so exempt.
" _Section 16  Information_" shall mean information accurate in all 
material respects regarding the Insiders, the number of shares  of the
capital stock held by each such Insider, and the number  and description of
options, stock appreciation rights,  restricted shares and other stock-based
awards held by each such  Insider. " _Insiders_ " shall mean those officers 
and directors of XM who are subject to the reporting  requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act and who  are listed in the Section 16
Information. 

       5.9 __Fees and  Expenses_._ Whether or not the Merger is 
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with  this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be  paid by the
party incurring such expense, except as otherwise  provided in Section 7.2
and except that (a) if the  Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay, or  cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes
imposed  on the parties hereto in connection with the Merger, and  (b)
expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing  and mailing the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the  Form S-4  shall be shared equally by

  (a) On or prior to the Effective Time, Siriuss Board  of Directors shall
take such actions as are necessary to amend  its By-Laws to cause the number
of directors that will comprise  the Board of Directors of Sirius at the
Effective Time to be 12  persons. Immediately following the Effective Time,
the Board of  Directors of Sirius shall consist of: (i) four members 
selected by Sirius, each of whom shall qualify as an independent  director
pursuant to the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules in effect from  time to time (an "

Independent Director at all times that Sirius  Common Stock is listed on

General  Motors and the other of whom shall be a designee of American  Honda
(the " _Designated Directors_ ");  (iv) the Chief Executive Officer of Sirius
and (v) the  Chairman of the Board of Directors. For all purposes
hereunder,  the Designated Directors shall not be deemed to qualify as 
Independent Directors. Prior to the Effective Time,  Siriuss Board of
Directors shall approve by a vote of at  least two-thirds of the directors in
office at such time the  composition of Siriuss Board of Directors as set
forth in  this Section 5.10(a), effective immediately following the 
Effective Time. 

  



  

  (b) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Sirius Board of  Directors
shall take such actions as are necessary to appoint  Mel Karmazin as Chief
Executive Officer of Sirius, effective as  of the Effective Time. On or prior
to the Effective Time, the  Sirius Board of Directors shall take such actions
as are  necessary to appoint Gary M. Parsons as Chairman of the Board of 
Directors of Sirius, effective as of the Effective Time. In the  event that
either Mr. Karmazin or Mr. Parsons is or  will be unable to serve in his
designated position beginning as  of the Effective Time, either as notified
in writing to the  parties by such individual prior to the Effective Time or
as a  result of such individuals death or disability, then the  individual
to replace Mr. Karmazin or Mr. Parsons, as  the case may be (in either case,
the  " _Successor_ "), shall be determined by joint  agreement of the
parties, each of whom shall cooperate in good  faith with the other party and
use its reasonable best efforts  to identify, as promptly as practicable and
in any event prior  to the Effective Time, the appropriate Successor. In the
event  that the parties have been unable to identify and reach  agreement
with each other regarding a Successor within  30 days after the occurrence of
the event giving rise to  the need to select such Successor (" _Deadlock_
"),  the parties shall follow the procedures set forth on  Section 5.10(b)
of each of the XM Disclosure Schedule and  the Sirius Disclosure Schedule. 

  



  

  (c) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Sirius Board of  Directors
shall take such actions as are necessary to establish  three standing
committees: a Nominating and Corporate Governance  Committee, an Audit
Committee and a Compensation Committee.  Members of the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee,  Audit Committee and Compensation Committee
shall qualify as  Independent Directors. The Chairman of the Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee shall be selected by directors  designated by
Sirius. The Chairman of the Audit Committee and  the Chairman of the
Compensation Committee shall be selected by  directors designated by Sirius
and XM, with each designating one  such chairman. The composition of the
members of the Nominating  and Corporate Governance Committee, Audit
Committee and  Compensation Committee, including the respective chairman of 
each such committee, shall be designated in equal shares by  directors
designated by Sirius and directors designated by XM. 

  



  

  (d) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Sirius Board of  Directors
shall take such actions as are necessary to amend its  By-Laws to provide
that, for a period of two years following the  Effective Time, (i) any
termination or replacement of  either the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman
of the Board of  Directors as of the Effective Time (or such individuals 
successor) and (ii) any sale, transfer or other disposition  of assets,
rights or properties which are material, individually  or in the aggregate,
to Sirius (or the execution of any  agreement to take any such action), shall
require the prior  approval of a majority of the Independent Directors. 

       5.11 __Indemnification; Directors  and  Officers Insurance_._
(a) From  and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,  to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses  to, each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the  date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an  officer, director or employee of XM or any of its
Subsidiaries  (the " _XM Indemnified Parties_ ") against all  losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or  judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement of or in  connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or  investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole  or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a  director,
officer or employee of XM 

  
 ##### Table of Contents

  

  

  or any Subsidiary of XM, and pertaining to any matter existing  or
occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to  the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at  or after, the Effective
Time (including matters, acts or  omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this  Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or
have  the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this  Agreement
by XM pursuant to XMs Certificate of  Incorporation, By-laws and
indemnification agreements, if any,  in existence on the date hereof with any
directors, officers and  employees of XM and its Subsidiaries. 

  



  

  (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the  Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the  current policies of
directors and officers liability  insurance maintained by XM ( _provided_
that the Surviving  Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a 
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage  and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less  advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from  facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation  shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for
such  insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the  premiums
paid as of the date hereof by XM for such insurance  (" _XM s Current
Premium_"), and if such  premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed
300% of  XMs Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall  cause
to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the  Surviving Corporations
good faith determination, provide  the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium equal to  300% of XMs Current Premium. 

  



  

  (c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all  expenses,
including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel,  which an indemnified
person may incur in enforcing the indemnity  and other obligations provided
for in this Section 5.11. 

  



  

  (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors  or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other  person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation  or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its 
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such  case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so  that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as  the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this  Section 5.11. 

  



  

  (e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended  to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each  Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and representatives and are  in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to  indemnification or contribution that any such
person may have by  contract or otherwise. 

       5.12 __Public  Announcements.__ Sirius, Merger Co. and XM  shall
use reasonable best efforts (i) to develop a joint  communications plan, (ii)
to ensure that all press releases  and other public statements with respect
to the transactions  contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such
joint  communications plan, and (iii) except in respect of any  announcement
required by applicable law or by obligations  pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of NASDAQ in  which it is impracticable to consult
with each other as  contemplated by this clause (iii), to consult with each 
other before issuing any press release or, to the extent  practical,
otherwise making any public statement with respect to  this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In  addition to the foregoing, except to
the extent disclosed in or  consistent with the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in  accordance with the provisions of Section 5.1 or
as  otherwise permitted under Section 4.3, no party shall issue  any press
release or otherwise make any public statement or  disclosure concerning the
other party or the other partys  business, financial condition or results of
operations without  the consent of such other party, which consent shall not
be  unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

       5.13 __Additional  Agreements.__ In case at any time after the

stockholders or result in additional liability  to XMs or Siriuss directors
or officers.

Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or  Schedules, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit or  Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise

meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words  "include",
"includes" or  "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be  deemed
to be followed by the words "without  limitation". The phrase "made
available" in this  Agreement shall mean that the information referred to has
been  made available by the party to whom such information is to be  made
available. The phrases "herein,"  "hereof," "hereunder" and words of
similar  import shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole, 
including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and not to any  particular
provision of this Agreement. The word "or"  shall be inclusive and not
exclusive. Any pronoun shall include  the corresponding masculine, feminine
and neuter forms. The  phrases "known" or "knowledge" mean, with  respect to
either party to this Agreement, the actual knowledge  of such partys

Agreement (including  the documents and the instruments referred to herein) 
(a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all  prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral,  between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof,  other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive  the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (b) except 
as provided in Section 5.11 (which is intended for the  benefit of only the
persons specified therein), is not intended  to confer upon any person other
than the parties hereto any  rights or remedies hereunder. 

       8.6 __Governing Law_._ This  Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance  with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect  to choice of law principles thereof). 

       8.7 __Severability_._ Any  term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or  unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that 
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or 
unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or 
unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the  major portion
of the economic benefits of the Merger that they  currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom, shall not render  invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of  this Agreement or affect the validity or
enforceability of any  of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other  jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as  to
be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be  only so broad as
is enforceable.

rights, interests or obligations  of the parties hereunder shall be assigned
by either of the  parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) 
without the prior written consent of the other party, and any  attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall  be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this  Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and  permitted assigns. 

       8.9 __Submission to  Jurisdiction_._ Each party hereto 
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of (i) the Supreme  Court of the
State of New York, New York County, and  (ii) the United States District
Court for the Southern  District of New York, for the purposes of any suit,
action or  other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any 
transaction contemplated hereby. Each party hereto agrees to  commence any
action, suit or proceeding relating hereto either  in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of  New York or, if such suit,
action or other proceeding may not be  brought in such court for reasons of
subject matter  jurisdiction, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New  York County. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally  waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit  or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby in (A)
the Supreme Court of the State  of New York, New York County, or (B) the
United States  District Court for the Southern District of New York, and
hereby  further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to 
plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or  proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an  inconvenient forum. Each
party hereto further irrevocably  consents to the service of process out of
any of the  aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or other 
proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail to such  party at its
address set forth in this Agreement, such service  of process to be effective
upon acknowledgment of receipt of  such registered mail; _provided_ that
nothing in this  Section 8.9 shall affect the right of any party to serve 
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The consent  to
jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.9 shall not  constitute a general
consent to service of process in the State  of New York and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as  provided in this Section. The parties
hereto agree that a final  judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
shall be  conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on 
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. 

       8.10 __Enforcement_._ The  parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event  that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed  in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or 
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the  parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or other equitable  relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce  specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any  court identified in the Section above, this being in
addition to  any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. 

       8.11 __WAIVER OF JURY  TRIAL_._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
WAIVES  TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY, IN 
ANY MATTERS (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN  ANY WAY
ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH, THIS  AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
