45    v.    AGREEMENT AND PLAN  OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION   This
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of August 1, 2000 (the "Execution Date"), by and
among: Terayon Communication Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"); MN Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); Mainsail Networks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"); and the parties identified on Exhibit A (the
"Designated Stockholders"). Certain other capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit B.   Recitals   A. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company in
accordance with this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"Merger"). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist,
and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.   B. It is
intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). For accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger
be treated as a "purchase."   C. This Agreement has been approved by the
respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.   D.
As set forth opposite each party\'s name on Exhibit A, the
Designated Stockholders own a total of 12,000,000 shares of the Common Stock
(par value $0.0001 per share) of the Company ("Company Common Stock");
300,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (par value $0.0001 per share)
of the Company ("Series A Preferred Stock"); and warrants to purchase 286,458
shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Warrants"). Contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Designated Stockholder is
executing and delivering to Parent a Stockholder Agreement of even date
herewith in the Form of Exhibit O.   Agreement   The parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:  SECTION 1. Description of Transaction   1.1
Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").  
1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law.   1.    1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward llp, One
Maritime Plaza, 20/th/ Floor, San Francisco, California 94111 at 10:00 a.m.
on a date to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no
later than the fifth business day after which the last condition set forth in
Sections 6 and 7 has been fulfilled or waived. Contemporaneously with or as
promptly as practicable after the Closing, a properly executed certificate of
merger conforming to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law
shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective at the time such certificate of merger is filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Effective
Time").   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and
Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent and the Company prior to the
Effective Time:   (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform
to Exhibit C;   (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and   (c) the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the individuals identified on Exhibit D.   1.5
Conversion of Shares.   (a) Subject to Sections 1.9(c) and 1.10, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company
(the "Company Stockholders"):   (i) each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal
Shares (as  defined in Section 1.10(c)) shall be converted into the right to
receive  the "Applicable Fraction" (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(i)) of a
share of  the common stock (par value $0.01 per share) of Parent ("Parent
Common  Stock");   (ii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock (if any) 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal 
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the fraction of a  share
of Parent Common Stock (A) having a numerator equal to $0.1666666 
(representing the "Liquidation Preference" of each share of Series A 
Preferred Stock under the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation), and (B) 
having a denominator equal to the Designated Parent Stock Price (as defined 
in Section 1.5(b)(iv));   (iii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock (par
value $0.0001  per share) of the Company ("Series B Preferred Stock") (if
any) outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Appraisal Shares) shall  be converted into the right to receive the fraction
of a share of Parent  Common Stock (A) having a numerator equal to $0.3333333
(representing the  "Liquidation Preference" of each share of Series B  
2.    Preferred Stock under the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation),
and (B)  having a denominator equal to the Designated Parent Stock Price (as
defined  in Section 1.5(b)(iv));   (iv) each share of Series C Preferred
Stock (par value  $0.0001) of the Company ("Series C Preferred Stock") (if
any) outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Appraisal Shares) shall  be converted into the right to receive the fraction
of a share of Parent  Common Stock (A) having a numerator equal to $4.32
(representing the  maximum amount payable in respect of a share of Series C
Preferred Stock  under the liquidation provisions of the Company\'s
Certificate of  Incorporation), and (B) having a denominator equal to the
Designated Parent  Stock Price (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(iv)); and  
(v) each share of the common stock (par value $0.0001) of  Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be  converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) For purposes
of this Agreement:   (i) The "Applicable Fraction" shall be the fraction:
(A)  having a numerator equal to the amount by which the Aggregate Merger
Amount  (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(ii)) exceeds the Aggregate Preferred
Stock  Liquidation Preference (as defined in Section 1.5(b)(iii)); and (B)
having  a denominator equal to the amount determined by multiplying (1) the 
Adjusted Fully Diluted Company Share Amount (as defined in Section 
1.5(b)(iv)) by (2) the Designated Parent Stock Price (as defined in Section 
1.5(b)(v)).   (ii) The "Aggregate Merger Amount" shall be the amount by 
which Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) exceeds the Identified 
Stockholder Expenses (as defined in Section 10.3).   (iii) The "Aggregate
Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference"  shall be the sum of the following
three items:   (1) $0.1666666 (representing the "Liquidation  Preference"
of each share of Series A Preferred Stock under the  Company\'s Certificate
of Incorporation) multiplied by the aggregate  number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time;   (2)
$0.3333333 (representing the "Liquidation  Preference" of each share of
Series B Preferred Stock under the  Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation)
multiplied by the aggregate  number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time; and   (3) $4.32
(representing the maximum amount payable in  respect of a share of Series C
Preferred Stock under the liquidation  provisions of the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation) multiplied  by the aggregate number of shares
of Series C Preferred Stock  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   3.    (iv) The "Adjusted Fully Diluted Company Share Amount"
shall be  the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
such  shares that are subject to a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture
under  any restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement), and (B)
the  aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under
or  otherwise subject to all Company Options (as defined in Section 1.7(a)) 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including all shares  of
Company Common Stock that may ultimately be purchased under Company  Options
that are unvested or are otherwise not then exercisable).   (v) The
"Designated Parent Stock Price" shall be Sixty-Two  Dollars and Fifty Cents
($62.50).   (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then
the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends.   1.6 Indemnification Escrow. At the Effective
Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equivalent to ten percent
(10%) of the number resulting from the division of the Aggregate Merger
Amount by the Designated Parent Stock Price (such shares being the
"Indemnification Escrow Shares") shall be deposited into escrow pursuant to
an Escrow Agreement in the form of Exhibit E (the "Indemnification Escrow
Agreement"). The Indemnification Escrow Shares so deposited shall be referred
to herein as the "Indemnification Escrow Fund." The Indemnification Escrow
Shares shall be deducted from each Company Stockholder\'s proportionate share
of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger on a pro rata
basis at or immediately following the Effective Time. The Indemnification
Escrow Shares will be paid out to the extent and upon the terms set forth in
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.   1.7 Employee Stock Options.   (a)
At the Effective Time, each stock option that is then outstanding under the
Company\'s 1997 Stock Option Plan, whether vested or unvested (a "Company
Option"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company\'s 1997 Stock Option
Plan and the stock option agreement by which such Company Option
is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under
outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time,   (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely 
for shares of Parent Common Stock,   (ii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each such  assumed Company Option shall be equal to
the number of shares of Company  Common Stock that were subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to  the   4.    Effective Time
multiplied by the Applicable Fraction, rounded down to the  nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock,   (iii) the per share exercise
price for the Parent Common Stock  issuable upon exercise of each such
assumed Company Option shall be  determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock  subject to such Company Option, as in
effect immediately prior to the  Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction,
and rounding the resulting  exercise price up to the nearest whole cent,  
(iv) and all restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed  Company
Option shall continue in full force and effect, and the term, 
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company  Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each such  assumed
Company Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to  further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock  split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction  effected by
Parent after the Effective Time.   (b) The Company and Parent shall take all
action that may be necessary (under the Company\'s 1997 Stock Option Plan and
otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7.   (c)
Following the Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an assumed Company
Option a written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Option and (ii) the exercise
price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Company Option.   1.8 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books. At the
Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of the Company\'s
capital stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of the Company\'s capital stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of such
shares of the Company\'s capital stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section
1.9.   1.9 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) At or as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent will send to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate to Parent for exchange, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by Parent, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1, and the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as  
5.   contemplated by this Section 1.9, each Company Stock Certificate shall
be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock) as contemplated by this Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing
Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver
a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate.   (b) No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any
fractional share shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder
surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.9
(at which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends
and distributions and such cash payment).   (c) No fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no
certificates for any such fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such
fractional shares, any holder of capital stock of the Company who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock
Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such
fraction by the Designated Parent Stock Price.   (d) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder
of capital stock of the Company pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to deduct or withhold
therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (e)
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or
former holder of capital stock of the Company for any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash
amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   1.10 Appraisal
Rights.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company (the "Company
Shares") that constitute Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 1.10(c))
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Parent Common
Stock in accordance with Section 1.5, and each holder of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Appraisal Shares
as may be granted to such   6.   holder in Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Appraisal Shares shall not have and shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of Parent. If any holder
of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or shall otherwise lose such
holder\'s right of appraisal under Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, then (i) any right of such holder to require Parent to
purchase the Appraisal Shares for cash shall be extinguished, and (ii) such
Appraisal Shares shall automatically be converted into and shall
represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such Appraisal Shares) Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 1.5.   (b) The Company (i) shall give Parent
written notice of any demand by any stockholder of the Company for appraisal
of such stockholder\'s Company Shares pursuant to the Delaware General
Corporation Law, and (ii) shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand.   (c) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Appraisal Shares" shall refer to any Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by
stockholders who are entitled to demand and who properly demand appraisal of
such Company Shares pursuant to, and who comply with the
applicable provisions of, Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law.   1.11 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.   1.12 Accounting
Treatment. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be treated as a
"purchase."   1.13 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and
to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.  SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties of the Company and
the Designated  Stockholders   The Company and the Designated Stockholders
jointly and severally represent and warrant, to and for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, as follows:   2.1 Due Organization; No Subsidiaries; Etc.  
(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all necessary power
and authority: (i) to conduct its business in the manner in which its
business is currently being conducted; (ii) to   7.   own and use its
assets in the manner in which its assets are currently owned and used; and

contractor of the Company that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other such Contracts, will, or could reasonably be
expected to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any

2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each salary, bonus, deferred

supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-sharing, pension or retirement
plan, program or agreement (collectively, the "Plans") sponsored, maintained,
contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company for the
benefit of any employee of the Company ("Employee"), except for Plans
which would not require the Company to make payments or provide benefits
having a value in excess of $25,000 in the aggregate.   (b) Except as set
forth in Part 2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not
maintain, sponsor or contribute to, and, to the best of the knowledge of the
Company and the Designated Stockholders, has not at any time in the past
maintained, sponsored or contributed to, any employee pension benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not excluded from coverage
under specific Titles or Merger Subtitles of ERISA) for the benefit of
Employees or former Employees (a "Pension Plan").   18.    (c) The
Company maintains, sponsors or contributes only to those employee welfare
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, whether or not excluded
from coverage under specific Titles or Merger Subtitles of ERISA) for the
benefit of Employees or former Employees which are described in Part 2.15(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Welfare Plans"), none of which is
a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA).   (d)
With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent:   (i) an
accurate and complete copy of such Plan (including all  amendments
thereto);   (ii) an accurate and complete copy of the annual report, if 
required under ERISA, with respect to such Plan for the last two years;  
(iii) an accurate and complete copy of the most recent summary  plan

such Plan, including service provider agreements, insurance contracts, 
minimum premium contracts, stop-loss agreements, investment management 
agreements, subscription and participation agreements and recordkeeping 
agreements; and   (vi) an accurate and complete copy of the most recent 
determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service with  respect

of the Code).   (e) The Company is not required to be, and, to the knowledge
of the Company and the Designated Stockholders, has never been required to
be, treated as a single employer with any other Person under Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. The
Company has never been a member of an "affiliated service group" within the
meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code. To the knowledge of the Company and
the Designated Stockholders, the Company has never made a complete or partial
withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, as such term is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal liability," as such term is defined
in Section 4201 of ERISA (without regard to subsequent reduction or waiver of
such liability under either Section 4207 or 4208 of ERISA).   (f) The
Company does not have any plan or commitment to create any additional Welfare
Plan or any Pension Plan, or to modify or change any existing Welfare Plan or
Pension Plan (other than to comply with applicable law) in a manner that
would affect any Employee except as agreed hereunder.   19.    (g) Except
as set forth in Part 2.15(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Welfare Plan
provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or not insured) with
respect to any current or former Employee after any such Employee\'s
termination of service (other than (i) benefit coverage mandated
by applicable law, including coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, (ii) deferred compensation benefits
accrued as liabilities on the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet, and (iii)
benefits the full cost of which are borne by current or former Employees (or
the Employees\' beneficiaries)) .   (h) With respect to each of the Welfare
Plans constituting a group health plan within the meaning of Section
4980B(g)(2) of the Code, the applicable provisions of Section 4980B of the
Code ("COBRA") have been complied with in all material respects.   (i) Each
of the Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, including but not limited to
ERISA and the Code.   (j) Each of the Plans intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code either (A) has received a favorable determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, or (B) may rely on an opinion letter
issued to a prototype plan sponsor with respect to a standardized plan
adopted by the Company in accordance with the requirements for such reliance,
and neither the Company nor any of the Designated Stockholders is aware of
any reason why any such determination letter should be revoked.   (k)
Except as set forth in Part 2.15(k) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the consummation of
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will result in any payment (including any bonus, golden parachute
or severance payment) to any current or former Employee or director of the
Company (whether or not under any Plan), or materially increase the benefits
payable under any Plan, or result in any acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such benefits (except as required under Section 411(d)(3)
of the Code).   (l) Part 2.15(l) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list
of all salaried employees of the Company as of the date of this Agreement,
and correctly reflects, in all material respects, their salaries, any
other compensation payable to them (including compensation payable pursuant
to bonus, deferred compensation or commission arrangements), their dates of
employment and their positions. The Company is not a party to any collective
bargaining contract or other Contract with a labor union involving any of its
Employees. All of the Company\'s employees are "at will" employees.   (m)
Part 2.15(m) of the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Employee who is not
fully available to perform work because of disability or other leave and sets
forth the basis of such leave and the anticipated date of return to full
service.   (n) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Legal Requirements and Contracts relating to employment,
employment practices, wages, bonuses and terms and conditions of employment,
including employee compensation matters.   (o) Except as set forth in Part
2.15(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has good labor relations, and
none of the Designated Stockholders has any reason to   20.   believe
that any of the Company\'s employees intends to terminate his or
her employment with the Company.   2.16 Environmental Matters. The Company
is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws, which compliance includes the possession by the Company of all permits
and other Governmental Authorizations required under applicable Environmental

not received any notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise),
whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that
alleges that the Company is not in compliance with any Environmental Law,
and, to the knowledge of the Company and Designated Stockholders, there are
no circumstances that may prevent or interfere with the Company\'s compliance
with any Environmental Law in the future. To the knowledge of the Company and
the Designated Stockholders, no current or prior owner of any property leased

however, that the maximum liability under Section 9.2(a) for each Venture
Capital Fund shall in no event exceed 15% of the entire
consideration received pursuant to this Agreement by such Venture Capital
Fund; and   (iii) For all Company Stockholders who are neither Designated 
Stockholders nor Venture Capital Funds, the maximum liability under Section 
9.2(a) shall be the pro rata share of such Company Stockholder in the 
Indemnification Escrow Fund.   9.4 Administration of Claims. All claims for
indemnification by any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement
including, but not limited to, any requirement for submission of claims to
binding arbitration.   39.    9.5 Satisfaction of Indemnification Claim.
In the event any Designated Stockholder or Venture Capital Fund
(collectively, the "Identified Stockholders") shall have any liability to any
Indemnitee under this Section 9 in excess of the value of such Identified
Stockholder\'s pro rata share of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, such
Identified Stockholder shall satisfy such liability by delivering to such
Indemnitee the number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing
(a) the aggregate dollar amount of such liability by (b) the Designated
Parent Stock Price.   9.6 No Contribution. Each Designated Stockholder
waives, and acknowledges and agrees that he or she shall not have and shall
not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or
any other liability to which he may become subject under or in connection
with this Agreement, the Company\'s Closing Certificate or the Designated
Stockholders\' Closing Certificate.   9.7 Interest. Any Designated
Stockholder who is required to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9 with respect to any
Damages shall also be liable to such Indemnitee for interest on the amount of
such Damages (for the period commencing as of the date on which such
Designated Stockholder first received notice of a claim for recovery by such
Indemnitee and ending on the date on which the liability of such
Designated Stockholder to such Indemnitee is fully satisfied by such
Designated Stockholder) at a floating rate equal to the rate of interest
publicly announced by Bank of America, N.T. and S.A. from time to time as its
prime, base or reference rate.   9.8 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the
event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal
Proceeding (whether against the Surviving Corporation, against Parent or
against any other Person) with respect to which any of the Indemnitees shall
have the right to seek indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, Parent
shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding on its own. If Parent so proceeds with the defense
of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:   (a) all reasonable expenses
relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be borne and
paid exclusively out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund or, with regards to
any claim or Legal Proceeding related to the Identified Representations, by
the Designated Stockholders and the Venture Capital Funds;   (b) each
Designated Stockholder shall make available to Parent any documents and
materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to the defense
of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and   (c) Parent shall have the right to
settle, adjust or compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent
of the Company Stockholders\' Agent (as defined in Section 10.1); provided,
however, that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Parent
shall give the Company Stockholders\' Agent prompt notice of the commencement
of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Surviving Corporation;
provided, however, that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Company Stockholders\' Agent shall not limit any of the rights of
the Indemnitees under this Section 9 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).   40.   
9.9 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No
Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof as
permitted pursuant to Section 10.11) shall be permitted to assert any
indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement
unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof as permitted
pursuant to Section 10.11) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.   9.10
Exclusive Remedy. Remedies provided by this Section 9 and the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies available to Parent and any
other Indemnitee for monetary damages for any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation contained in this
Agreement and any Legal Proceeding relating to the foregoing, except (i) in
the instance of fraud or (ii) as provided by Section 8.4   SECTION 10.
