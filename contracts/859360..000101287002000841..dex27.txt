OF CERTIFICATES   Section 3.1 Effect on Company Capital Stock. As of the
Effective Time, by  ------------------------------ virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders of any shares of Company Common
Stock, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (X) (other
than any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Major Stockholder and the
Major Stockholder Affiliates, any shares of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.2 and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive (a) 0.6876 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a fully paid
and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Merger
Consideration") and (b) an amount in cash equal to $2.50 per share without
interest, less any required withholding tax (the "Cash
Merger Consideration"); (Y) held by the Major Stockholder Affiliates shall be

Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. As of the Effective Time,
each Company Certificate, without any action on the part of the Parent, the
Company or the holder of such share of Company Common Stock, shall be deemed
to represent the right to receive the merger consideration as provided by the
second preceding sentence. Each holder of a Company Certificate shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon
the surrender of any such Company Certificates, certificates representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Company Certificate in accordance with Section 3.3 and
cash in lieu of fractional interests pursuant to Section 3.4.   Section 3.2

---------------------------------------------------- share of Company Common

Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than
shares in trust accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and the like
that are beneficially   12    owned by third parties) shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.   Section 3.3 Exchange of Company Certificates. 
--------------------------------   (a) As soon as practicable, the Parent
shall designate the Exchange Agent to act as agent for the holders of Shares
to receive in trust the shares of Parent Common Stock, funds to be paid for
fractional shares and funds to pay the Cash Merger Consideration, to which
holders of the Shares shall become entitled pursuant to this Article 3. From
time to time after the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Shares
the aggregate consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.1.   (b) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Company Certificates,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass,
only upon receipt of the Company Certificates by the Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions not inconsistent with this
Agreement as the Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of Company Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock together with any dividends and
other distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares and the Cash Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be credited
in street name through Depository Trust Company if delivered in street name
unless a physical certificate is specifically requested or is otherwise
required by applicable Law) and payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article 3 and (y)
cash in an amount equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Company Certificate and (II) the
Cash Merger Consideration, and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall
be cancelled. If certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock are
to be registered in the name of a Person, cash in lieu of fractional shares
is to be paid or the Cash Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of such certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock that the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate.   
13     (c) At the close of business on the day during which the Effective
Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.   (d) No dividends or
other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.4 and no Cash
Merger Consideration shall be paid to any such holder, until the surrender of
such Company Certificate in accordance with this Article 3. Subject to the
effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4 and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the
Cash Merger Consideration, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.   (e) All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 3.3(d) or 3.4) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Company Certificates, subject, however, to the obligation
of the Surviving Corporation, if any, to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 3,
except as otherwise provided by Law.   Section 3.4 No Fractional Shares. No
certificates representing fractional  --------------------- shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the
Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Shares converted pursuant to Section 3.1 who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Price.  
Section 3.5 Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest 
--------------------------- any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be payable to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent on demand.   Section 3.6 Termination of
Exchange Fund. At any time following twelve 
------------------------------ months after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to   
14    it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had been made available to
the Exchange Agent and which has not been disbursed to holders of
Company Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional interests in a share of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and the Cash
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Company
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company Certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional interests in a share of
Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Company Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   Section 3.7 Certain Adjustments. If between the date hereof and
the  ------------------- Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number
of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other
securities shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period,
or if the Rights become exercisable, the Exchange Ratio, Affiliate Share
Fraction and Major Share Fraction shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or dividend or issuance of
Rights.   Section 3.8 Company Options.  ----------------   (a) As of the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option shall thereafter entitle the
holder thereof to receive, upon the exercise thereof, (i) that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the
Exchange Ratio, and (ii) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Cash Merger
Consideration (unreduced by any withholding Taxes), at an exercise price per
share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option divided by
(z) the Exchange Ratio.   (b) As of the Effective Time, the Parent shall
assume in full each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, together with
all Company Stock Plans. The assumption of a Company Option by the Parent
shall not terminate or modify (except as required hereunder or as provided by
the existing terms of the Company Option, Company Stock Plans or any
Employment Agreement) any right of first refusal, right of repurchase,
vesting schedule or other restriction on transferability relating to a
Company Option or the stock issuable upon the exercise thereof. Continuous
employment with the Company shall be credited to an optionee for purposes of
determining the number of shares subject to exercise, vesting or repurchase
after the Effective    15    Time, and the provisions in the applicable
Company Stock Plans and stock option agreement evidencing the terms and
conditions of any Company Option relating to the exercisability of any
Company Option upon termination of an optionee\'s employment or service as a
director shall not be deemed triggered until such time as such optionee shall
be neither an employee or officer nor serving as a director of the Parent or
any Subsidiary of the Parent except as or as provided by the existing terms
of the Company Option, Company Stock Plans or any Employment Agreement. After
such assumption, the Parent shall issue, upon any partial or total exercise
of any Company Option, in lieu of shares of Company Common Stock, the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock as described in Section 3.8(a) together with
the Cash Merger Consideration. The Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a registration statement
on Form S-8 under the Securities Act, covering, to the extent permissible,
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Company
Options assumed pursuant to this Section 3.8(b). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall make such amendments, if any, to the Company Stock Plans as
shall be necessary to permit the assumption contemplated by this Section
3.8(b).   (c) Except provided by Section 3.8(a) or as may be otherwise
agreed to by the Parent and the Company, all stock option plans established
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall terminate as of the Effective
Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deleted, terminated
and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time.   (d) If and to
the extent necessary or required by the terms of the plans governing Company
Options or pursuant to the terms of any Company Option granted thereunder,
each of the Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of each holder of outstanding Company Options to the
foregoing treatment of such Company Options.   (e) The Company shall
terminate the Company ESPP in accordance with its terms immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Participants in the Company ESPP shall be notified of the
cancellation of the Company ESPP and shall have the opportunity to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock through the Company ESPP in accordance
therewith prior to the Closing.   Section 3.9 Appraisal Rights. Any
Dissenting Shares shall not be  ---------------- converted into, or be
exchangeable for, the right to receive Parent Common Stock and Cash Merger
Consideration but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the DGCL unless and until such Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be Dissenting Shares under the DGCL. The Company shall give
the Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal of Shares or the
existence of any Dissenting Shares (and shall also give the Parent prompt
notice of any withdrawals of such demands for appraisal rights). The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, enter into
negotiations or proceedings or voluntarily make any payments with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal rights. If, after
the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as
Dissenting Shares, the Parent shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such
stockholder of a Company Certificate, the number of shares of   
16    Parent Common Stock and Cash Merger Consideration to which such
stockholder would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Article 3 (and cash
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.4).   Section 3.10 Lost,
Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates. If any 
---------------------------------------------- Company Certificates are lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common
Stock (and cash for the Cash Merger Consideration and in lieu of fractional
shares) as may be required pursuant to Section 3.1, provided, however, that
the Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Certificates to indemnify the Parent against any claim that may be
made against the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   Section 3.11 Withholding Rights. The Parent or the Surviving 
------------------ Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Exchange Agent to deduct or withhold, from the shares of Parent
Common Stock and Cash Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts
as it reasonably determines it was required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of such shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.   Section 3.12 Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. As of
the  -------------------------------------- Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the holder of shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock, each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 3.13 Taking of Necessary Action; Further
Action. If, at any  ------------------------------------------ time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of their
corporation or otherwise to take, and will use good faith efforts to take,
all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not
inconsistent with this Agreement.   17     ARTICLE 4

and approvals under any of the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s

------------------   (a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

conditions to Closing. In addition, no party hereto shall take any action
after the date of this Agreement to materially delay the obtaining of, or
result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any

Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other covenant in this
Agreement, in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under
the HSR Act, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to divest or hold separate or otherwise take, or commit to take, any
action that limits the Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s freedom of
action with, or their ability to retain, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any material portions thereof or any of the businesses, product
lines, properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, without
the Parent\'s prior written consent (which may be withheld in the Parent\'s
sole and absolute discretion).   (b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall
promptly consult with the other parties hereto with respect to, provide any
necessary information with respect to, and provide the other parties (or
their respective counsel) with copies of, all filings made by such party with
any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions, except to the extent any such information is sensitive
competitive information. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of
any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
Transactions. If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional   42    information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Transactions, then such party
shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. To the extent that
transfers, amendments or modifications of permits (including environmental
permits) are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
consummation of any of the Transactions, the Company shall and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to effect such
transfers, amendments or modifications.   (c) The Company and the Parent

thereafter as practicable, the Company and the Parent shall each request
early termination of the HSR Act waiting period.   (d) Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to

restrict its conduct of business or (y) commence any litigation against any
entity in order to facilitate the consummation of any of the Transactions or
to defend against any litigation brought by any Governmental Entity seeking
to prevent the consummation of any of the Transactions. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Parent and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain any government clearances required for the Merger
(including through compliance with the HSR Act and any applicable
foreign government reporting requirements) and to respond to any requests
for information from any Governmental Entity, including any so-called
"Second Request" under the HSR Act.   Section 6.5 No Solicitation of
Competing Transaction.  ----------------------------------------   (a)
Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall (and the Company
shall cause the officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents of
the Company, each Affiliate of the Company, and their respective investment
bankers, financial advisers, attorneys, accountants and other agents, not
to), directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or
initiate or resume (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public
information), or take any action designed to facilitate, any discussions,
inquiries, negotiations or any other action that could be expected to lead to
the making of any proposals with respect to or concerning any Competing
Transaction. Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 or any other provision of
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company\'s board of
directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant
to Rule 14d-9 or Rule l4e-2 under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making such
disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of
the board of directors of the Company, after consultation with outside
counsel, is required under applicable law; provided, that the Company may
not, except as permitted by Section 6.5(b), withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, its position with respect this Agreement or to the  
43     Merger or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend
any Competing Transaction, or enter into any agreement with respect to any
Competing Transaction. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company will
immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Company stockholder
approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement, the Company may
furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to any
corporation, partnership, Person or other entity or group pursuant to
appropriate confidentiality agreements (which shall be no more permissive
than the Confidentiality Agreement and shall permit the disclosure
contemplated by this Section 6.5(a)), and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such entity or group concerning a Competing
Transaction if such entity or group has, on an unsolicited basis and without
violation of this Section 6.5, submitted a bona fide written proposal to the
board of directors of the Company relating to any such transaction which
the board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
and financial advisors, is or may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.   The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify the Parent of the existence of any proposal, discussion,
negotiation or inquiry of the type referred to in this Section 6.5(a)
received by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
representatives, and the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) communicate to the Parent the material terms of any proposal,
discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective representatives may receive and the identity of the party
making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or
negotiation. The Company will promptly provide to the Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company provided any other party which was not
previously provided to the Parent.   (b) Except as set forth in this Section
6.5(b), neither the Company\'s board of directors nor any committee thereof
shall effect a Change in Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to receipt of the Company stockholder approval of the Merger
and adoption of this Agreement, the Company\'s board of directors may
withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger, approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, or terminate this Agreement
and enter into an agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii), in each
case at any time after 48 hours following the Parent\'s receipt of written
notice from the Company advising the Parent that the board of directors of
the Company has received a Superior Proposal which it intends to accept,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal. Nothing in
this Agreement shall permit the Company to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with any third party making or proposing to make
a Competing Transaction providing for the payment of fees or reimbursement of
expenses if the Parent makes a proposal in response to such Superior
Proposal, other than in an agreement entered into in accordance with the
preceding sentence concurrently with termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(ii).   Section 6.6 Publicity. The initial press release
with respect to the  --------- execution of this Agreement shall be a joint
press release reasonably acceptable to each of the Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, until the Effective Time, or the date this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article 8 (whichever occurs first), neither the
Company, the Parent nor any of their   44    respective Affiliates shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without
prior consultation with the other party, except as advised by outside counsel

exchange or trading market, in which case, prior consultation with the other
party will be made to the extent reasonably practicable.   Section 6.7
Notification of Certain Matters. Each Party shall give prompt 
------------------------------- notice to the other party, of (a) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which caused or would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at or prior to the Effective Time and (b) any material
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies of the other party.   Section 6.8
Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance and Indemnification. 
------------------------------------------------------   (a) For six years
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the
Surviving Corporation) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
fees and expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and
judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(provided, that any such settlement is effected with the written consent of
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation) arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the full extent required under
applicable Delaware law, the terms of the Company\'s certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or indemnity agreements in the form filed as exhibits
to Company SEC Documents, each as in effect at the date hereof; provided,
that if any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of any and all such claims. For a period of
six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation (and
its successors) shall establish and maintain from and after the Effective
Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws concerning
the indemnification and exoneration of the Company\'s former and current
officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to
those persons than the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof.   (b) Prior to or
concurrent with the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six year
extension of the discovery period from the Effective Time under the
Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
policy; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company and the
Surviving Corporation together be required to expend in excess of $3 million
for such six year extension; provided, further, that prior to the execution
of such extension Parent shall be given the opportunity to review any
material enhancements to such extension as compared to the Company\'s current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy; and provided, further,
that if the Company is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by
this sentence of this Section 6.8(b) for such aggregate premiums, the Company
shall obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for aggregate premiums not
in excess of $3 million. If for any reason the coverage described in the
previous sentence should not be in full effect, the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain the Company\'s existing officers\' and
directors\'   45    liability insurance for a period of not less than
six years after the Effective Date; provided, that the Parent may substitute
therefor policies of coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable
to such former directors or officers as currently in effect for directors and
officers of the Parent; provided, further, that in no event shall the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums under this
Section 6.8(b) in excess of 150% of the premium paid by the Parent for
coverage of its directors and officers in the twelve months prior to the date
of this Agreement; and provided, further, that if the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required by this
sentence of this Section 6.8(b) for such aggregate premiums, the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much insurance as can be obtained
for aggregate premiums not in excess of 150% of the premium paid by the
Parent for coverage of its directors and officers in the twelve months prior
to the date of this Agreement.   (c) The rights of each Indemnified Party
hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights
such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified
Parties. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.8. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity contained in
this Section 6.8.   Section 6.9 State Takeover Laws. Notwithstanding any
other provision in  ------------------- this Agreement, in no event shall
the approval of the Transactions by the board of directors of the Company
under section 203 of the DGCL be withdrawn, revoked or modified by the board
of directors of the Company. If any state takeover statute becomes or is
deemed to become applicable to the Agreement, the acquisition of Shares
pursuant to the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary shall take all action necessary to render such
statute inapplicable to all of the foregoing. If under the Parent Rights Plan
(i) a Person will become an "Acquiring Person" and (ii) "Share Acquisition
Date" or "Distribution Date" will occur in each case, as a result of the
approval, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall take all action necessary to prevent the foregoing
and render such Parent Rights Plan inapplicable to all of the foregoing.

the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the  
46    Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act. The Parent shall also take any action required to be
taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the
conversion of Company Options into options to acquire Parent Common Stock,
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options as may reasonably be
requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be made by the Parent without the Company\'s prior consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and without providing the Company the
opportunity to review and comment thereon; provided that with respect to
documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of
approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
party or its business, financial condition or results of operations; and
provided further that the Company, in connection with a change in the
recommendation of its board of directors, or as otherwise required, may amend
or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement
(including by incorporation by reference). The Parent will advise the Company
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the
share of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to the Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company and the Parent.   (b) The
Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting (the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting") of its stockholders
entitled to vote thereon in accordance with the DGCL for the purpose of
obtaining the approval of the Company\'s stockholders and shall, subject to
the provisions of Section 6.5(b), through its board of directors, recommend
to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement.   (c) The Parent shall,
as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, duly give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting (the "Parent Stockholders\' Meeting") of its stockholders entitled to
vote thereon in accordance with   47    the DGCL for the purpose of
obtaining the approval of the Parent\'s stockholders and shall, through its
board of directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval of this
Agreement.   Section 6.11 Tax Treatment. Each of the Parent, the Company and
their  ------------- respective Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and to obtain the opinions of
counsel referred to in Sections 7.2(e) and 7.3(e). Neither the Parent, nor
the Company, nor their respective Subsidiaries, shall take any action which
could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code.   Section
6.12 Conveyance Taxes. The Company and the Parent shall cooperate 
---------------- in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,

permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.   Section 6.13

exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Transactions is
intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.   (b)

Rule 16b-3.   Section 6.14 Affiliate Legends. Section 6.14 of the Company
Disclosure  ----------------- Letter sets forth a list of those persons who
are, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment, as of the date of this Agreement,

agreement become "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act, the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Parent
shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing
any shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by Rule 145 Affiliates of
the Company in the Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock. The Company shall

to enter into an affiliate agreement with Parent (the "Rule 145 Affiliate
Agreements") substantially in the form set forth in Section 6.14 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.   Section 6.15 Service Credit. Following the

prior service with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for purposes of
(a) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Benefit Plans, (b) determination
of benefits levels under any Parent Benefit Plan or policy relating to
vacation or severance and (c) determination of "retiree" status under any
Parent Benefit Plan, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is

duplication of benefits or (ii) otherwise cause Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or any Parent Benefit Plan or trust relating thereto to accrue or
pay for benefits that relate to any time period prior to the Continuing
Employee\'s participation in the Parent Benefit Plan.   Section 6.16
