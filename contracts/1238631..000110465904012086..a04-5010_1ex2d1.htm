the Purchase Price Adjustment multiplied by the percentage resulting from
dividing the number of Common Shares held by the Sellers by the number of
Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Closing.  Within ten
business days after final determinations are made pursuant to Sections
2.4(b), (c) and (d), (a) if the Sellers Purchase Price Adjustment is owing to
Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to payment of such amount from the Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the balance of such Escrow Amount, if any, shall
be distributed to Sellers in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Seller Purchase
Price Adjustment owing to Buyer is greater than the Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount, Buyer shall offset such difference from the Indemnification Escrow
Amount if such difference is less than $1,000,000; _provided, further_ ,
that if such difference exceeds $1,000,000, then Buyer may pursue any
available remedies to recover the full amount of the difference, including
offsetting such difference from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, or (b) if
the Sellers Purchase Price Adjustment is owing to Sellers, the entire Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be distributed to Sellers in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement and Buyer shall pay the amount of the
Sellers Purchase Price Adjustment to the Sellers, pro rata in accordance with
their respective ownership of Common Shares as set forth on Schedule 1 to
this Agreement, either by bank cashiers or certified check payable to the
order of a Seller, or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by such Seller.  

  



  

The Purchase Price shall not be adjusted under this Section 2 as a result of
Sellers breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, and the
indemnification provisions of Section 11.2 shall be the exclusive remedy of
Buyer with respect to any such breach by Sellers. Buyer shall not have any
right to seek or obtain indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2 for any
disputed item in the Preliminary Closing Statement.

  



  

## 2.6 NO RIGHT OF OFFSET

  

## 

  

Buyer may not offset any amounts to which it may be entitled under the terms

available to it hereunder.

43      
   



  

## 6.4 ACCESS

  

## 

  

### (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause
the Company to afford to Buyer and their authorized representatives
reasonable access at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice to the
offices, properties, books, records and officers of the Company, and the work
papers of the Companys independent accountants relating to work done by such
accountants with respect to the Company, and otherwise provide such
assistance as is reasonably requested by Buyer; provided, however, that the
Parties acknowledge that Buyer shall not be provided with any competitively
sensitive information prior to Closing, whether or not such disclosure would
be permitted by applicable anti-trust rules and regulations or any other
Legal Requirement. The parties acknowledge that access will be provided at
times that minimize business disruption. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) shall be directed to such Person as may
be designated by the Company. Buyer and Sellers shall, and the Sellers shall
cause the Company to, cooperate fully (including providing introductions
where necessary) in setting up and jointly executing a communications plan to
contact the vendors, suppliers and referral sources of the Company that
Buyer, in good faith, deems reasonably necessary to complete its due
diligence.

  

### 

  

### (b) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause
the Company to deliver to Buyer monthly unaudited consolidated balance sheets
and statements of earnings of the Company, prepared in a manner consistent
with prior periods; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the
Sellers makes any representation or warranty regarding the accuracy or

### 

  

## 6.5 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

  

## 

  

Sellers will promptly notify Buyer of any material change at the Company,
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, or the commencement or threat
of any material litigation. Until the Closing, or unless this Agreement is
otherwise terminated pursuant to Section 10 below, Sellers will promptly
notify Buyer in writing if any Seller should discover that any representation
or warranty made in this Agreement by such Seller was when made, or has
subsequently become, untrue in any respect. Sellers shall also use their
best efforts to deliver to Buyer prior to March 8, 2004 any
supplementing amendments to the Disclosure Letter required to cause the
representations and warranties made in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement, as
qualified by the Disclosure Letter as amended to such date, to be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that such
supplementing amendments to the Disclosure Letter (plus any additional
amendments provided to Buyer after March 8, 2004) shall be deemed to amend or
supplement the Disclosure Letter in order to prevent or cure any inaccuracy,
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of agreement by Sellers under
this Agreement for purposes of the right to indemnification under Section
11.2, but such supplementing amendments shall not be considered for purposes
of determining whether the conditions to Closing have been satisfied.  As a
matter of clarification and subject to the limitations set forth in the above
sentence, Sellers shall have the right to update the Disclosure Letter until
the Closing Date and not after that. If the Closing occurs, then Buyer shall
be deemed to have accepted the

  



  

44      
   



  

Disclosure Letter as so amended for all purposes under this Agreement,
including for indemnification under Section 11. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the update to Part 3.35 of the Disclosure Letter delivered
by Sellers to Buyer as contemplated by the last sentence of Section 3.35
shall be deemed to update and amend the Disclosure Letter upon delivery to
Buyer.

  



  

## 6.6 TRANSFER TAXES

  

## 

  

The Sellers agree to pay all applicable transfer, sales, stamp or other
Taxes, if any, associated with the sale of the Shares to Buyer.

  



  

## 6.7 TAX MATTERS

  

## 

  

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Buyer, Sellers and the Company for certain Tax matters following the
Closing Date:

  



  

### (a) The Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Company and
Buyer and hold them harmless from and against any loss, claim, liability,
expense or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Company for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Pre-
Closing Tax Period"), and (ii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than
the Company) imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract
or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, for a Pre-Closing Tax Period;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sellers shall be liable only to the extent
that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes (excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) on the face of the Interim Financials (rather
than in any notes thereto); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if
the indemnification provided by the Sellers under this Section 6.7
combined with the indemnification provided by the Sellers under Section 11
exceeds $12,500,000, the amount of such excess, to the extent that it is less
than the total amount of indemnification provided by the Sellers under
this Section 6.7, shall be the several and not joint liability of each
Seller. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the Company which are
the undisputed liability of Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.7(a)
within fifteen (15) business days after receiving written notice from Buyer
of the payment of such Taxes by Buyer or Company. If Sellers have disputed
their liability with respect to such claim within 15 business days after
receipt of Buyers notice, Buyer and Sellers will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute.  Buyer and Sellers agree that Buyer
shall recover any indemnification provided by the Sellers under this Section
6.7 first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount held by the Escrow Agent
before pursuing any other remedies.

  

### 

  

### (b) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date, (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date and the amount of Taxes other than Taxes
based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company that relates to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount

  



  

45      
   



  

### of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company which are due after the Closing Date for
periods ending on or before or including the Closing Date.  Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice (to the
extent past practice complies with applicable Tax law), and on such Tax
Returns, no positions shall be taken, elections made or methods adopted that
are inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in
preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods except as and to
the extent required by a Taxing Authority pursuant to the provisions
of applicable Tax law. Buyer shall permit Sellers Representative to review
and comment on all such Tax Returns and shall make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative. If
Buyer amends any Tax Returns, which were filed prior to the Closing Date, in
a manner that would change the taxable income of the Company and such
amendment affects the Tax liability of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, then Buyer shall obtain the approval of the Sellers Representative,
and such approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld by the
Sellers Representative.

  

### 

  

## 6.8 TAX INFORMATION

  

## 

  

The Sellers Representative and Buyer will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as each of them reasonably may request of the
other in filing any return, amended return or claim for refund of Taxes,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or in
conducting any audit or proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Company. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant
returns of Taxes of the Company or portions thereof, together with associated
schedules and related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Taxing Authorities. Each party and the Company shall make
its employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanation
of any documents or information provided hereunder and shall retain and
provide records and information reasonably relevant to any such
return preparation, liability determination, refund request, audit or
other proceeding.

  



  

## 6.9 401(K) PLAN AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITIES

  

## 

  

Effective as of a date prior to Closing, the Company shall terminate its
401(k) plan and shall cause all active participants to become fully (100%)
vested in their plan accounts as of such termination date. Prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall cause the Company to pay and discharge the payment of
any pro-rata matching and/or employer contribution under any 401(k) plan,
retirement plan, and non-qualified deferred compensation plan, arising out of
or relating to the employment of the Companys employees by the Company prior
to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, any continuation coverage
required pursuant to IRC Section 4980B as the result of any "qualifying
event" (within the meaning of IRC Section 4980B(f)(3)) occurring with respect
to any employee of the Company (or any spouse or dependent of any such
employees) after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall
also cause the Company to properly

  



  

46      
   



  

accrue and reserve for, in accordance with GAAP, employee benefits under the
Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

## 6.10 CONFIDENTIALITY

  

## 

  

### (a) Sellers will keep confidential and protect, and will not divulge,
allow access to or use in any way, (i) trade secrets, product specifications,
data, know-how, formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches,
photographs, graphs, drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past, current
and planned research and development, current and planned manufacturing and
distribution methods and processes, customer lists, current and anticipated
customer requirements, price lists, market studies, business plans, computer
software and programs (including object code and source code), computer
software and database technologies, systems, structures and architectures
(and related processes, formulae, compositions, improvements, devices, know-
how, inventions, discoveries, concepts, ideas, designs, methods, and
information, (ii) any and all nonpublic information concerning the Company
(including historical financial statements, financial projections and
budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending budgets and plans,
the names and backgrounds of key personnel, personnel training and techniques
and materials, however documented, and (iii) any and all notes, analyses,
compilations, studies, summaries, and other material containing or based, in
whole or in part, on any information including in the foregoing (the
"Confidential Information"). Sellers acknowledge that such Confidential
Information constitutes a unique and valuable asset of the Company and
represents a substantial investment of time and expense by the Company, and
that any disclosure or other use of such Confidential Information other than
for the sole benefit of the Company would be wrongful and would cause
irreparable harm to the Company and the Buyer. After the Closing Date, Sellers
will deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy, at the request and option of
Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of such Confidential
Information that relates to the Company that are in the possession of
Sellers.

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers agree that the provisions and restrictions contained in this
Section 6.10 are necessary to protect the legitimate continuing interests of
Buyer in acquiring the Company, that this Section 6.10 has been
specifically bargained for, that any violation or breach of such provisions
and restrictions will result in irreparable injury to Buyer for which a
remedy at law would be inadequate and that, in addition to any relief which
may be available to Buyer for such violation or breach, and regardless of any
other provision contained in this Agreement, Buyer will be entitled to seek
injunctive and other equitable relief restraining such violation or breach
(without any requirement that Buyer provide any bond or security) and Sellers
agree to waive any defense that a monetary remedy would be adequate.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event that Sellers are requested or required (by oral question
or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, that Sellers will notify Buyer
promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.10.  If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder,

  



  

47      
   



  

### Sellers are, on advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information, Sellers may disclose the Confidential Information to the
tribunal; provided, however, that Sellers will use their best efforts to
obtain at the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed as Buyer may designate.

### 

  

### (h) any excess of the Purchase Price Adjustment owing to buyer over the
Price Adjustment Amount.

  

### 

  

If Buyer has a claim for indemnification under this Section 11.2, Buyer will
deliver to Sellers Representative one or more written notices of Damages.
Any written notice will state in reasonable detail the basis for such Damages
to the extent then known by Buyer and the nature of Damages for which
indemnification is sought, and it may state the amount of Damages claimed by
Buyer. If such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of
Damages claimed and Sellers Representative notifies Buyer that Sellers do
not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify Buyer
within 20 business days after delivery of such notice by Buyer whether
Sellers dispute the claim described in such notice, such Damages in the
amount specified in Buyers notice will be admitted by Sellers, and Sellers
will pay the amount of such Damages to Buyer. If Sellers have timely disputed
their liability with respect to such claim, Buyer and Sellers will proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If a written notice
does not state the amount of Damages claimed, such omission will not preclude
Buyer from recovering from Sellers the amount of Damages with respect to the
claim described in such notice if any such amount is promptly provided once
determined.  Buyer and Sellers agree that (i) subject to Section 2.5 for
any indemnification under Section 11.2(h), (ii) except for Section 11.2(b)
and (iii) except for any indemnification under Section 11.2(f) which in the

  



  

57      
   



  

aggregate exceeds $1,000,000, and for which the Buyer may pursue any
available remedies for the aggregate amount, Buyer shall recover any
indemnification provided by Sellers under this Section 11.2 first from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount held by the Escrow Agent before pursuing any
other remedies, if available.

  



  

## 11.3 INDEMNIFICATION AND PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY BUYER

  

## 

  

Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, and will pay to Sellers the
amount of any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection
with:

  



  

### (a) any untruth or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

  

### 

  

### (b) the failure by Buyer to observe or perform any covenant or obligation
of Buyer in this Agreement;

  

### 

  

### (c) any Claims or Threatened Claims against an indemnified party arising
in connection with the actions or inactions of the Company or the Buyer or
the officers, directors, partners, employees or agents of the Company with
respect to the business of the Company or its real property or other assets
after Closing; or

  

### 

  

### (d) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finders fees or commissions
or similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by such Person with Buyer (or any Person acting on its behalf) in
connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions.

  

### 

  

If Sellers have a claim for indemnification under this Section 11.3, Sellers
Representative will deliver to Buyer one or more written notices of Damages.
Any written notice will state in reasonable detail the basis for such Damages
to the extent then known by Sellers and the nature of Damages for which
indemnification is sought, and it may state the amount of Damages claimed by
Sellers. If such written notice (or an amended notice) states the amount of
Damages claimed and Buyer notifies Sellers Representative that Buyer does
not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify Sellers
Representative within 20 business days after delivery of such notice by
Sellers Representative whether Buyer disputes the claim described in such
notice, such Damages in the amount specified in Sellers Representatives
notice will be admitted by Buyer, and Buyer will pay the amount of such
Damages to Sellers.  If Buyer has timely disputed its liability with respect
to such claim, Buyer and Sellers Representative will proceed in good faith
to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If a written notice does not
state the amount of Damages claimed, such omission will not preclude Sellers
from recovering from Buyer the amount of Damages with respect to the claim
described in such notice if any such amount is promptly provided once
determined.

  



  

## 11.4 TIME LIMITATIONS

  

## 

  

If the Closing does not occur, Sellers will have no liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to any representation or warranty

before the 18th month anniversary of the Closing Date Buyer notifies Sellers
of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to
the extent then known by Buyer. If the Closing occurs, a claim with respect
to (i) Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 may be made at any time,
and (ii) Sections 3.11, 3.13, 3.14, 3.21, 3.23, 3.24, 3.28, 3.29, 3.30
and 3.33, or a claim for indemnification or reimbursement based upon any
covenant or obligation of Sellers set forth in this Agreement may be made
only until the earlier of six (6) years following the Closing Date or the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for such matters.  If
the Closing occurs, Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to any representation or warranty (other
than pursuant to Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3), or covenant or obligation to
be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, unless on or before
the 18th month anniversary of the Closing Date Sellers notify Buyer of
a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to
the extent then known by Sellers.

the matters described in Section 11.2, other than Sections 11.2(b), (e), (f)
and (h), until the total of all Damages with respect to all such matters
exceeds $1,250,000. Once this amount has been exceeded, Damages shall be
calculated based on the full amount of the Damages, including this threshold
amount. No claim for indemnification, except for claims arising pursuant to
Section 11.2(h), may be asserted except to the extent that the dollar value
of such claim exceeds $25,000, provided that, for purposes of this
determination, a "claim" will be deemed to arise from a single circumstance
or a collection of circumstances based on similar facts that gives rise to a
single claim or cause of action, whether or not such cause of action is
pursued in any court proceeding. In no event will the Sellers be liable for
any Damages in excess of $12,500,000, other than with respect to Sections
11.2(b), (e), (f) and (h). Each individual Sellers liability
for indemnification with respect to the matters described in Sections 11.2
and 6.7 shall be limited to the portion of the Sellers Purchase Price
received by such Seller (net of amounts previously repaid pursuant to
Sections 11.2 and 6.7 hereof).

  

### 

  

### (b) Buyer shall take, and shall cause the Company to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Damages upon and after becoming
aware of any event, which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
Damages.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers will not be liable to, or indemnify any Indemnified Persons
for, any punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential Damages, or
diminution of value under Section 11.2.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers will not be liable to, or be required to indemnify any

under any other section of this Agreement.

  



  

59      
   



  

## 11.6 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNTBUYER

  

## 

  

Buyer will have no liability for indemnification with respect to the matters
described in Section 11.3 until the total of all Damages with respect to such
matters exceeds $1,250,000. Once this amount has been exceeded, Damages shall

this threshold amount. In no event will the Buyer be liable for any Damages
with respect to the matters described in Section 11.3 in excess of $
12,500,000.

  



  

## 11.7 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATIONTHIRD PARTY CLAIMS

  

## 

  

### (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 11.2
or Section 11.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against
it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party
of the commencement of such claim.

  

### 

  

### (b) If any Proceeding referred to in Section 11.7(a) is brought against
an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim
involves Taxes, be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the
extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to
such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying
party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its
financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with
respect to such Proceeding) to assume the defense of such Proceeding with
counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under
this Section 11 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred
by the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party
assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established
for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are
within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such claims  may be effected by the indemnifying party without
the indemnified partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission
of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any
Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party
will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such
claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying
party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does
not, within ten days after the indemnified partys notice is given, give
notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in
such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified
party.

  

### 

  

### (c) Sellers hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court
in which a Proceeding is brought against any indemnified party for purposes
of any claim

  



  

60      
   



  

### that an indemnified party may have under this Agreement with respect to
such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and agree that process may be
served on Sellers with respect to such a claim anywhere in the United States
of America.

  

### 

  

## 11.8 MATERIALITY AND KNOWLEDGE LIMITATIONS

  

## 

  

The parties agree that, for purposes of the indemnification provisions of
this Section 11, a determination of whether a breach of a representation or
warranty has occurred shall be made taking into account any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers, but without taking into account any
knowledge qualifiers other than the knowledge qualifiers contained in
Sections 3.8, 3.18(d)(i)(B), 3.21 (with respect to Knowledge regarding
intended termination by employees of the Company), 3.26 (with respect to
relationships with third party payors) and 3.36; however, the amount of
any Damages arising from the breach of the representation or warranty shall
be the entire amount of the Damages incurred, suffered or sustained by the
indemnified party as a result of such breach, and not just the portion of the
Damages that exceeds the relevant level of materiality.  

  



  

## 11.9 SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

  

## 

  

After the Closing, the rights set forth in this Section 11 shall be each
partys sole and exclusive remedies against the other parties hereto for
breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or warranties or breaches of
covenants contained in this Agreement or all other agreements created in
connection with the Agreement and contemplated herein, and in furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties on behalf of itself and its Related
Persons, hereby waives and releases the other parties hereto (and such other
parties Related Persons) from, to the fullest extent permitted under any
Legal Requirements, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or its
Related Persons may have against the other party hereto except as provided
herein; provided, that this limitation shall not apply in the event of fraud;
and provided further any party hereto is entitled to seek
emergency, provisional or summary relief under applicable Legal Requirement
with respect to any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or all
other agreements created in connection with the Agreement and contemplated
herein, and accordingly such party may pursue injunctive relief with respect
to any such breach, including specific performance of any covenants, promises
or agreements or an order enjoining a party from any threatened, or from the
continuation of any, actual breach of covenants, promises or agreements. Any
indemnification of the Sellers pursuant to Section 11.3 shall be effected by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
recipient within 15 days after the determination thereof.

  



  

## 11.10 DETERMINATION OF DAMAGES.  

  

## 

  

The amount of any Damages indemnified under this Section 11 shall be net of
the present value (computed at the time that any such indemnification recover
is made using a discount rate equal to the Near Close Federal Funds rate at
the end of the day on the Closing date, as cited on the Wall Street Journal)
of any income Tax benefits inuring to the indemnified party under this
Section 11 as the result of the state of facts which entitled such
indemnified party to recover the Damages under Section 11 and of any income
Tax burdens to which the indemnified party will be subject as a result of
such recovery (taking into account the timing differences in the

  



  

61      
   



  

realization of any such benefits), with such benefits calculated using the
then-effective consolidated federal income tax rate of the indemnified party.
For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat all payments made under this
Section 11 as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

## 12.5 GOVERNING LAW

  

## 

  

### (a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects
shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the
law of the State of New York without regard to the conflict of law principles
thereof.

  



  

63      
   



  

### (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv)
EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS SECTION 12.5.

  

### 

  

## 12.6 FURTHER ASSURANCES

  

## 

  

The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further
information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other such other documents,
and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as the other party may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this
Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

## 12.7 WAIVER

  

## 

  

The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative.  Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege; provided, however, that in the event that the Closing occurs,
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived the right to claim a breach of any
representation and warranty which was actually known to Buyer before the
Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver
or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other
party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except
in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to
or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of
such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action.

  



  

## 12.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION

  

## 

  

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements between the parties with
respect to its subject matter (including the proposal letter of the Buyer
dated January 26, 2004) and constitutes (along with the documents referred to
in this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of

  



  

64      
   



  

the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject
matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement
executed by the Sellers and a duly authorized officer of the Buyer
specifically stating that it amends this Agreement.

  



  

## 12.9 DISCLOSURE LETTER

  

## 

  

In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement and those in the Disclosure Letter (other than an exception set
forth as such in the Disclosure Letter), the statements in the body of this
Agreement will control. The information furnished in the Disclosure Letter is
arranged in Sections corresponding to the Sections contained in
this Agreement, and the disclosures in any Section of the Disclosure Letter
shall qualify (i) the corresponding Section of this Agreement, (ii)
any other Section of this Agreement which is specifically cross-referenced in
such disclosure, and (iii) other Sections of this Agreement to the
extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) it would
be clear to any prudent Person based on a reasonable reading of the
disclosure (without any additional investigation or inquiry concerning the
subject matter of the disclosure) and such other Sections of this
Agreement that such disclosure would also be applicable to such other
Sections of this Agreement.

  



  

The Disclosure Letter and the information and disclosures contained in the
Disclosure Letter is intended only to qualify and limit the representations
and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed
to expand in any way the scope of any such representation, or warranties or
covenants.  The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Letter shall
not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such information is
material or outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

  



  

## 12.10 ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

  

## 

  

Except as provided in Section 6.14, neither party may assign any of its
rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of the other parties;
provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right, without the consent of
any of the Sellers, to assign all or any portion of its rights, duties and
obligations under this Agreement to any Related Person of Buyer. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all
respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement
will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement
any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

  



  

## 12.11 SEVERABILITY

  

## 

  

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid
or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
fully or partially

  



  

65      
   



  

invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefore in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

## 12.12 SECTION HEADINGS, CONSTRUCTION

  

## 

  

The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only
and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references
to "Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of
this Agreement. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of
such gender or number as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise
expressly provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words
or terms. Buyer and the Seller agree that any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against the party that drafted it is of no application and
is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

## 12.13 TIME OF ESSENCE

  

## 

  

With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

## 12.14 COUNTERPARTS

  

## 

  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which,
when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.
