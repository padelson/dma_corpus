Section 1.05 _Effective Time; Closing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, Buyer Bank,

the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof.

(b) The Bank Merger shall become effective as set forth in the articles of
merger providing for the Bank Merger (the " _Articles of Bank Merger_ ") that

Effective Time or as promptly as practicable thereafter.

(c) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place beginning immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such date, the " _Closing Date_ ") at the offices of Kutak Rock LLP, 124

required to be delivered under ARTICLE VI hereof.

 



2 Section 1.06 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Buyer shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Company, Company Bank, Companys
Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors shall be deemed to
have granted to Buyer and Buyer Bank, and each or any of them, an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such official corporate
capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any other
acts as are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of Buyer or Buyer Bank, as
applicable, are authorized in the name of Company, Company Bank and Companys
Subsidiaries or otherwise to take any and all such action.

ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 2.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Bank, Company Bank, Company or
any shareholder of Company:

(a) Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned directly by Buyer (other than
shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of
customers or shares held as collateral for outstanding debt previously
contracted) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock and shares described
in _Section 2.01(b)_ above) shall automatically and without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof be converted into the right to
receive the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock determined using the
Exchange Ratio.

Section 2.02 _Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all unvested Company Restricted
Shares shall vest in full so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or
vesting requirements pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plans, and all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for
all purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, for
purposes of the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto. The Board of Directors of the Company (" _Company Board_ ") (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
effect the foregoing.

 



3 (b) On the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company
shall (i) terminate and cancel each issued and outstanding Company Stock
Option and Company SAR and (ii) pay each holder thereof a cash payment equal
to the difference between the per share exercise price, as set forth in such
holders award agreement with respect to such Company Stock Option or Company
SAR, and the Company Stock Price.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(a)_ with respect to
Company Restricted Shares, Company shall take all requisite action so that,
prior to the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options, Company SARs, the
Treasury Warrants, and any other Rights, contingent or accrued, to acquire or
receive Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of such shares,
and each award of any kind consisting of Company Common Stock that may be
held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under
the Company Stock Plans, or otherwise, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action, terminated and cancelled. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any
actions (including obtaining any consents) that may be necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 2.02_.

 

(d) Buyer may at any time and without the approval of Company change the
method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement
if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable; provided,
however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount of the
consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock as Merger
Consideration as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) reasonably be
expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (iii)
adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger, or (iv) require submission to or
approval of the Companys shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in
this Agreement has been approved by the Companys shareholders. In the event
that Buyer elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the change.

Section 2.03 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of Company
Common Stock, when converted as provided in _Section 2.01(c)_, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Shares previously
evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
for each such share of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with
this ARTICLE II. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Company, other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as provided under this ARTICLE II.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

Section 2.04 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of
a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock, rounded to the nearest
one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest and rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest in Buyer Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by the Buyer Average Stock Price.

 



4 Section 2.05 _Plan of Reorganization_. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used
in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. The business purpose of the Merger and
the Bank Merger is to combine two financial institutions to create a strong
community-based commercial banking franchise. From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 2.06 _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
Closing Date, and provided that Company has delivered, or caused to be
delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange
Agent shall mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock (" _Holder_ ") appropriate and customary
transmittal materials, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent, as well as instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration as provided for in this Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
").

 

Section 2.07 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates representing the number
of shares of Buyer Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and Buyer shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger Consideration
(together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.04_) (collectively, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), and Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay
such Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with this Agreement.

(b) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as
any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with this  _Section 2.07_ and _Section 2.08(a)_ shall
thereafter look only to Buyer for the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest
thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for shares of
Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not
claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer Common Stock or cash
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other applicable Law, become the property of Buyer (and to
the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor

 



5  any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for
any Merger Consideration (or any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of
those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common
Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, Buyer and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of
competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and file legal proceedings interpleading all
parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

Section 2.08 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal timely
delivered to the Exchange Agent, a Holder will be entitled to receive as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor (with such cash rounded to the nearest
whole cent) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s). The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as
the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares of
Buyer Common Stock to a Holder to which such Holder would otherwise be
entitled as a result of the Merger until such Holder surrenders the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing the shares of Company Common
Stock for exchange as provided in this ARTICLE II, or, an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such amount as may
be required in each case by Buyer (but not more than the customary amount
required under Buyers agreement with its transfer agent).

(b) All shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Buyer in respect of the Buyer
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Buyer Common Stock shall be
paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
until such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE II. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to
such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

 



6 (c) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority and upon such remittance shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

 

Section 2.09 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event that on or after the
first trading day used in determining the Buyer Average Stock Price and
before the Effective Time Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of
a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer
Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted; _provided that_
, for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to
the Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common
Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party
transaction, or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director stock options,
restricted stock awards, grants or similar equity awards or Buyer issues Buyer
Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of any such options, grants or awards.

in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.16(a)_. Neither Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members has any stated plan, intention or
commitment to establish any new company benefit plan or to modify any Company
Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by Law).

 

(b) Company has provided Buyer with true and complete copies of all Company
Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and

(c) All Company Benefit Plans are in compliance in form and operation with

which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Company
401(a) Plan_ "), has received a favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS, and neither Company nor Company Bank is aware of any
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination or opinion letter or the loss of the
qualification of such Company 401(a) Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code,
and nothing has occurred that would be expected to result in the Company
401(a) Plan ceasing to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
All Company Benefit Plans have been administered in accordance with their
terms. There is no pending or, to Companys Knowledge, threatened litigation
or regulatory action relating to the Company Benefit Plans. Neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Members has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including a Company
401(a) Plan that could subject Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Controlled Group Members to a tax or penalty under any Law including, but not
limited to, Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. No Company
401(a) Plan has been submitted under or been the subject of an IRS voluntary
compliance program submission. There are no audits, investigations, inquiries
or proceedings pending or threatened by the IRS or the Department of Labor
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

or formerly maintained by Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Controlled Group
Members or any entity which is considered one employer with Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "). Neither Company, Company
Bank nor any ERISA Affiliate (or their predecessor) has ever maintained a plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of Company,
Company Bank, or any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to (or been obligated to
contribute to) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA at any time and neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled
Group Members has incurred, and does not expect to incur, any withdrawal
liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No
notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
has been required to be filed for any Company Benefit Plan or by any ERISA
Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(e) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Company Benefit
Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the consolidated
financial statements of Company. No Company Benefit Plan or single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or
not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.

(f) Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.16(f)_, no Company
Benefit Plan provides or has any liability to provide life insurance, medical
or other employee welfare benefits to any Company Employee, or any of their
affiliates, upon his or her retirement or termination of employment for any
reason, except as may be required by Law, and neither Company nor any
Subsidiary has ever represented or contracted (whether in oral or written
form) to any Company Employee (either individually, or to Company Employees as
a group) that such Company Employee(s) would be provided with life insurance,
medical or other employee welfare benefits, upon their retirement or
termination of employment.

 

(g) All Company Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been operated
in compliance with the group health plan continuation requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and all other applicable sections of ERISA and the Code.
Company may amend or terminate any such Company Benefit Plan at any time
without incurring any liability thereunder for further benefits coverage at
any time after such termination.

(h) Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.16(h)_ or otherwise
provided for in this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement, shareholder
approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any Company Employee to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting (except as required by Law) or trigger any payment or funding (through
a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Company Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation

 



18  of, or a default under, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any
payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as
those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to
whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services
performed or to be performed in the future, (v) limit or restrict the right of
Company or Company Bank or, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or
terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans, or (vi) result in payments under
any of the Company Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section
280G of the Code.

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan or
arrangement is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable. All elections made with respect to compensation deferred under an
arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code have been made in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409A(a)(4) of the Code, to the extent
applicable. Neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group
Members (i) has taken any action, or has failed to take any action, that has
resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in the interest and tax
penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code being owed by any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan or (ii) has agreed to reimburse or
indemnify any participant in a Company Benefit Plan for any of the interest
and the penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be
currently due or triggered in the future.

 

(j) _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.16(j)_ contains a schedule showing the
present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in
such schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement, such as tax indemnification payments in respect of income
or excise taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or
similar contract, plan or arrangement with or which covers any present or
former director, officer or employee of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Controlled Group Members who may be entitled to any such amount and
identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due under
any Company Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code) for each such person, specifying the assumptions in such schedule
and providing estimates of other required contributions to any trusts for any
related fees or expenses.

 

(k) Company and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals who
directly or indirectly perform services for the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members for purposes of each Company Benefit
Plan, ERISA, the Code, unemployment compensation Laws, workers compensation
Laws and all other applicable Laws.

that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking
to compel Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike

appropriate notices to employees and/or customers in accordance with
applicable Law and the Companys privacy policy and, during such period, shall
from time to time furnish promptly to the Buyer all information concerning
the business, properties and personnel of Company and its Subsidiaries as the
Buyer may reasonably request.

 

(b) In addition to Buyers continuing right of access to Company and Company
Banks properties, books, records and personnel set forth in _Section
5.08(a)_, not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Company shall obtain and cause to be delivered simultaneously to Company and
Buyer for their respective review and approval a current valuation, as of a
date not more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, of all
securities in the investment portfolio of Company Bank. Such valuation shall
initially be prepared by First Tennessee Bank, N.A. (" _FTN_ "), and shall
follow the methodology, procedures and approach consistent with those employed
in the May 31, 2014 investment portfolio valuation prepared by FTN for Company
and Company Bank. Neither party will discuss the valuation with FTN or
attempt to influence FTNs valuation in any way. Each party shall have one (1)
Business Day after receipt to evaluate the FTN report, including the Closing
Date Mark-to-Market Valuation, and either accept it or request a second
valuation. If either party requests a second valuation then both Buyer and
Company will jointly present a request for a second Closing Date Mark-to-
Market Valuation (the " _Second Valuation_ ") to Standard and Poors Securities
Evaluations, Inc. (" _S andP_"). To the extent any of the securities in Company
Banks investment portfolio are not valued by SandP, a third nationally
recognized valuation service to be selected by mutual agreement of the
parties shall value those specific securities, such valuation to comprise part
of the Second Valuation. If the resulting Closing Date Mark-to-Market
Valuation arrived at using the Second Valuation differs from the resulting
Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation determined using the FTN valuation by
one percent (1%) or less, the resulting Closing Date Mark-to-Market valuation
provided by FTN will be used by the parties in connection with the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the resulting Closing Date
Mark-to-Market Valuation arrived at using the Second Valuation differs from
the resulting Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation using the FTN valuation
by more than one percent (1%), the mean average of the Closing Date Mark-to-
Market Valuations in the FTN valuation and the Second Valuation will be used
by the parties in connection with the Closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The (i) FTN Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation or (ii)
mean average of such valuation and the Closing Date Mark-to-Market Valuation
contained as part of the Second Valuation, whichever is applicable, is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Securities Valuation_."

(c) No investigation by Buyer or its representatives shall be deemed
to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Company or Company Bank set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the
respective obligations of Buyer and Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



43 Section 5.09 _No Solicitation by Company; Superior Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective officers, directors and employees not to, and will not authorize
any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, affiliates or other agents of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take
any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than Buyer) any information or data with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to
enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which the
Company is a party; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle
or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or
resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in
principle or letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any
violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Company Representatives,
whether or not such Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not
such Company Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company
or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any
Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean (A)
any transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any
transaction pursuant to which any third party or group acquires or would
acquire (whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or
indirectly, a significant portion of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including
by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or more of the votes
attached to the outstanding securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if

 



44  consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning
20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction which is similar in form, substance or
purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the
foregoing.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
Company or Company Bank, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 75% of the outstanding Company Common Stock
or more than 75% of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities and (ii) that
Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) is reasonably capable
of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and
the person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) taking into account any
changes to this Agreement proposed by Buyer in response to such Acquisition
Proposal, as contemplated by paragraph (c) of this _Section 5.09_, and all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such takeover proposal,
including all conditions contained therein and the person making such
proposal, is more favorable to the shareholders of Company from a financial
point of view than the Merger.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.09(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, the Company may take any
of the actions described in clause (ii) of _Section 5.09(a)_ if, but only
if, (i) the Company has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.09_; (ii) the
Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
and having considered the advice of its outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) it is required to take such
actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under applicable Law; (iii) the Company has provided Buyer with at least three
(3) Business Days prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior
to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement
with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement with Buyer. The Company shall promptly provide to
Buyer any non-public information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person which was not previously provided to Buyer, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other party.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer
in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate
the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making
such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails

 



45  or other electronic communications) except to the extent that such materials
constitute confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal
under an effective confidentiality agreement). The Company agrees that it
shall keep Buyer informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such proposal,
offer or request).

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify,
in a manner adverse to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Merger), the Company Recommendation, fail to
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following a
request by Buyer, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with
the Company Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Company Recommendation
(it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification
of the Company Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related
to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement
entered into in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.09(b)_) or (B)
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.09(d)_, prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company Board may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Company
Recommendation (a " _Company Subsequent Determination_ ") after the fifth
(5th) Business Day following Buyers receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Buyer that the Company Board
has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this  _Section 5.09_)
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that it is
required to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law, (ii) during the five (5) Business
Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by Buyer (the "
_Notice Period_ "), the Company and the Company Board shall have cooperated
and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make such adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable the Company to proceed with the Company Recommendation without a
Company Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that Buyer shall not have
any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms
as may have been proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company Board has again in good faith made the
determination (A) in clause (i) of this _Section 5.09(e)_ and (B) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Buyer and again comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.09(e)_, except that the Notice Period shall
be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

 



46 (f) Notwithstanding any Company Subsequent Determination, this Agreement shall
be submitted to the Companys shareholders at the Company Meeting for the
purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation; provided, however, that
if the Company Board shall have made a Company Subsequent Determination, then
the Company Board may submit this Agreement to the Companys shareholders
without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Companys
shareholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.09_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from complying with the Companys obligations required
under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however,
that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the Company
Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation
in such disclosure.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in
any event subject to the provisions of  _Section 5.10(b)(iv)_, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of
Company and Company Bank (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative arising out of actions or omissions of such persons in the
course of performing their duties for Company or Company Bank occurring at or
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each a " _Claim_ "), to the same extent as such persons have the
right to be indemnified pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Company or Company Bank, in effect on the date of this Agreement, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
5.10_ shall promptly notify Buyer upon learning of any Claim, provided that
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Buyer under this
_Section 5.10_, unless, and only to the extent that, Buyer is materially
prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the event of any
such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time), (i) Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Buyer
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses
or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii)
Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent and (iv) Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in violation of any
applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that
a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations, whether
or not related to banking Laws.

 



47 (c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to provide directors and officers
liability insurance (herein, " _D andO Insurance_") that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of Company or its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), which
insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as that
coverage currently provided by Company; _provided_ that if Buyer is unable to
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section 5.10_, Buyer
will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably available (subject
to the limitations described below in this _Section 5.10(c)_); and _provided,
further,_ that officers and directors of Company or its Subsidiaries may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance. In no event shall Buyer be required to expend for such tail
insurance a premium amount in excess of an amount equal to 200% of the annual
premiums paid by the Company for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum D andO Tail Premium_"). If the cost of such tail
insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, Buyer shall obtain tail
insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

(d) If Buyer or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 

Section 5.11 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) All Company Employees to whom Buyer in its sole discretion offers
employment at or prior to the Effective Time shall be retained as "at will"
employees after the Effective Time as employees of Buyer Bank so long as such
Company Employees accept the terms and conditions of employment specified by
Buyer; provided, that continued retention by Buyer Bank of such
employees subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject to Buyer Banks
normal and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary
background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment
performance. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyers
reasonable request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and Company
Employees a reasonable time in advance of the Closing Date regarding
employment, consulting or other arrangements to be effective prior to or
following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, any interaction
between Buyer and Company Employees shall be coordinated by Company or Company
Bank.

 

(b) Company Employees (other than those listed on _Disclosure Schedule Section
5.11_ who are parties to an employment, change of control or other type of
agreement which provides

 



48  for severance) as of the date of the Agreement who remain employed by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and whose
employment is terminated by Buyer or Buyer Bank (absent termination for cause
as determined by the employer) within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time shall receive severance pay in accordance with Buyers standard
practices (which may include a severance agreement and general release of
claims to be provided by the terminated employee) equal to one (1) week of
base weekly pay for each completed year of employment service commencing with
any such employees most recent hire date with Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and ending with such employees termination date with Buyer, with
a minimum payment equal to two (2) weeks of base pay and a maximum payment
equal to twelve (12) weeks of base pay. Subject to the terms and execution of
the severance agreement and general release of claims by such employee, such
severance payment will be made in accordance with the terms stated in the
severance document and such severance payments will be in lieu of any
severance pay plans that may be in effect at Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. No officer or employee of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is, or shall be, entitled to receive duplicative
severance payments and benefits under (i) an employment or severance
agreement; (ii) a severance or change of control plan; (iii) this _Section
5.11_; or (iv) any other program or arrangement.

 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, not later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall take all action
required to (i) cause any Company Benefit Plan that has liabilities in respect
of its participants, to be fully funded to the extent necessary to pay out all
required benefits, (ii) terminate all such plans effective as of Closing and
(iii) commence the process to pay out any vested benefits thereunder to
participating and eligible Company Employees in such form or forms as Company
or Company Bank elects and as permitted or required under applicable
Law. Distributions of benefits under any profit sharing plan of the Company
or Company Bank shall occur in accordance with such plans terms, and a
participant in such plan will be allowed to take, at the participants option:
(x) a direct distribution from such plan, (y) a rollover to an Individual
Retirement Account, or (z) a rollover to a tax qualified retirement plan of
Buyer or Buyer Bank to the extent the plan sponsored by Buyer or Buyer Bank
accepts rollover contributions, if such participant is employed by Buyer or
Buyer Bank.

(d) Company Employees who are retained by Buyer or Buyer Bank shall be
entitled to participate in Buyer Benefit Plans to the same extent as
similarly-situated employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood that
inclusion of Company Employees in the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans). To the extent feasible
under any of such plans, Company Employees shall be given credit for prior
service or employment with Company or Company Bank and eligible for any
increased benefits under such plans that would apply to such employees as if
they had been eligible for such benefits as of the Effective Time, based on
the length of service or employment with Company or Company Bank. With regard
to insured Buyer Benefit Plans, applicable waiting periods may apply.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may amend or terminate any Buyer Benefit
Plan at any time in its sole discretion.

(e) If employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank upon
termination of such plan of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to

 



49  cause each such plan to (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations to
the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health,
or dental plans of Buyer or Buyer Bank, (ii) subject to approval from Buyers
insurance carrier, provide full credit under such plans for any deductible
incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the
calendar year prior to such participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be
applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs.

(f) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this _Section
5.11_, Buyer shall honor, and Buyer shall be obligated to perform, all
employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or "change-in-
control" agreements, plans or policies of Company or Company Bank, but only
if such obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies are set forth in
_Disclosure Schedule Section 5.11_. Buyer acknowledges that the consummation
of the Merger and Bank Merger will constitute a "change-in-control" of
Company and Company Bank for purposes of any benefit plans, agreements and
arrangements of Company and Company Bank. Nothing herein shall limit the
ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of the Company
Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any
time, subject to vested rights of employees and directors that may not be
terminated pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 5.11_. Without limiting the foregoing, no
provision of this _Section 5.11_ will create any third party beneficiary
rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of Company
or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment)
or any other matter. Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ is intended (i) to amend
any Company Benefit Plan or any Buyer Benefit Plan, (ii) interfere with
Buyers right from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan that is not terminated prior to the Effective Time or
Buyer Benefit Plan, (iii) interfere with Buyers right from and after the
Effective Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by any
director, employee, independent contractor or consultant or (iv) interfere
with Buyers indemnification obligations set forth in  _Section 5.10_.

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, all unvested Company Restricted Shares
granted under the Company Stock Plans shall vest in full so as to no longer
be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements pursuant to the terms of
the Company Stock Plans, and all such Company Restricted Shares shall be
considered outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for all purposes of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, for purposes of the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto and the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to effect the foregoing prior to
the Effective Time.

(i) On the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company
shall (i) terminate and cancel each issued and outstanding Company Stock
Option and Company SAR and (ii) pay each holder thereof a cash payment equal
to the difference between the per share exercise price, as set forth in such
holders award agreement with respect to such Company

 



50  Stock Option or Company SAR, and the Company Stock Price. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement with respect to Company Restricted
Shares, Company shall take all requisite action so that, prior to the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, Company SAR or other Right,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Company Common Stock or benefits
measured by the value of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting
of Company Common Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or
reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans, or otherwise, will be
terminated and cancelled. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions (including obtaining any consents) that may be necessary to
effectuate the foregoing prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Changes_. Buyer and Company shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or which it believes
would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its or its respective
Subsidiaries representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. From
time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to the Closing
Date), Company will supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedules delivered in
connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedule which has
been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to any
Disclosure Schedule or provision of information relating to the subject matter
of any Disclosure Schedule after the date of this Agreement shall operate to
cure any breach of a representation or warranty made herein or have any effect
for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.02(a)_ or _Section 6.03(b)_ hereof, as the case may be, or
compliance by Buyer or Company with the respective covenants and agreements of
such parties set forth herein.

 

Section 5.13 _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, each of Company and Buyer will cause one or
more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent
basis (not less than weekly) with representatives of the other party and to
report the general status of the ongoing operations of Company and
its Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Company agrees to provide to Buyer (i) a copy of each
report filed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental
Authority within one (1) Business Day following the filing thereof and (ii)
by 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on each Business Day, a copy of Companys daily
statement of condition and daily profit and loss statement for the preceding
Business Day.

 

Section 5.14 _Board Packages_. Company shall distribute a copy of any Company
or Company Bank board package, including the agenda and any draft minutes, to
Buyer via secure email or similar electronic means at the same time in which
it distributes a copy of such package to the board of directors of Company or
Company Bank; provided, however, that Company shall not be required to copy
Buyer on any documents that disclose confidential discussions of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter that
Companys or Company Banks board of directors has been advised by counsel
that such distribution to Buyer may violate a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or may result in a waiver of the
Companys attorney-client privilege.

 



51 Section 5.15 _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion_. From and after
the date hereof, Buyer and Company shall use their commercially reasonable
best efforts to facilitate the integration of Company with the business of
Buyer following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the
data processing and related electronic informational systems of Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (the " _Informational Systems Conversion_ ") to those
used by Buyer, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of Company and each of
its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective Time, of
personal property leases and software licenses used by Company and each of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the systems operations; (c) retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion;
(d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or
self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and
appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Company on request for any
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that Company may incur as a
result of taking, at the request of Buyer, any action prior to the Effective
Time to facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion.

 

Section 5.16 _Access to Customers and Suppliers_. From and after the date
hereof, Company shall, upon Buyers reasonable request, introduce Buyer and
its representatives to suppliers of Company and its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of facilitating the integration of Company and its business into that
of Buyer. In addition, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.01(a)_ and _Section 6.01(b)_, the Company shall, upon Buyers
reasonable request, introduce Buyer and its representatives to customers of
Company and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating the integration
of Company and its business into that of Buyer. Any interaction between Buyer
and Companys and any of its Subsidiaries customers and suppliers shall be
coordinated by Company. Company shall have the right to participate in any
discussions between Buyer and Companys customers and suppliers.

Section 5.17 _Environmental Assessments_.

 

(a) Upon Buyers request, and to the extent that Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not have reasonably current Phase I reports meeting the
standards described below already in its possession, Company shall cooperate
with and grant access to an environmental consulting firm selected and paid

actions Buyer may reasonably request in connection with negotiating any

exceed its budget for Company Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.21_, Company shall not incur any investment

survive termination, for any reason whatsoever, of this Agreement, and,
without limiting the remedies of the parties hereto in the event of any breach

analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure; provided, however, that neither party nor any of its
Representatives shall disclose any information relating to such tax treatment
or tax structure to the extent nondisclosure is necessary in order to comply
with applicable securities or tax laws.

 

(c) To the extent that any Confidential Information includes materials subject
to the attorney-client privilege, the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and
shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work-product
protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges
as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including any
Confidential Information relating to pending or threatened litigation) to the
Receiving Party or any of its Representatives.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, no investigation by either of the parties or
their respective Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement.

with any of the terms of either that certain Confidentiality Agreement
between the Company and Buyer dated April 9, 2014 or that certain

fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action
or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a

Section 7.02 _Termination Fee; Liquidated Damages_.

 

(a) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone
by Buyer while structuring and pursuing the Merger, in the event Buyer
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_, Company shall pay to
Buyer a termination fee equal to $7.9 million, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within two (2) Business Days after receipt of Buyers
notification of such termination.

(b) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)_ or _Section 7.01(e)_ by reason of
Companys or Company Banks material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement contemplated by _Section 7.01(d)_ or _Section 7.01(e)_ that is
not timely cured as provided in such sections, or if Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_, the actual damages sustained by
Buyer, including the expenses incurred by Buyer preparatory to entering into
this Agreement and in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement, would be significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged
by the circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is executed, and that
in lieu of Buyer being required to pursue its damage claims in costly
litigation proceedings in such event, the parties agree that Company shall pay
a reasonable estimate of the amount of such damages, which the parties agree
is the sum of $1,750,000 (the " _Liquidated Damages Payment_ "), as
liquidated damages to Buyer, which payment is not intended as a penalty,
within two (2) Business Days after Buyers notification of such termination.

 

(c) Company and Buyer each agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due under
this _Section 7.02_, Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the
date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from
time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any
successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the
date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs
and expenses of Buyer (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. 

 



62 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 7.01(d)_, _Section 7.01(e)_, _Section 7.01(g)_ or _Section
7.01(h)_ and if Company pays or causes to be paid to Buyer or to Buyer Bank
the termination fee in accordance with _Section 7.02(a)_, or, if applicable,

entity and (ii) Company Bank will merge with and into Buyer Bank, with Buyer
Bank as the surviving entity (collectively, the "Merger"), and in
connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock

to the number of shares of Company Common Stock as indicated on the signature

WHEREAS, it is a material inducement to the willingness of Buyer to enter into
the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to, Buyer

incurred by Buyer in connection therewith, Shareholder and Buyer agree as
follows:

 

 _Section 1_. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that, while this

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or
indirectly, the sole right to vote or direct the voting, (i) in favor of

any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay,
postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. 
---|--- 

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of Company, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

 _Section 2_. _No Transfers_. While this Agreement is in effect, Shareholder
agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or

arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,

such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in which case this Agreement

agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing, prior to such
transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (c) transfers in
connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to

agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, and (d) such transfers as Buyer may otherwise permit in its sole
discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of
this _Section 2_ shall be null and void.

_Section 3_. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder
represents and warrants to and agrees with Buyer as follows:



     | (a) | Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to
enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Shareholder, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Buyer, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the
performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the 

---|---|--- 
 



A-2 hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any
agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration
award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which
Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder
is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is a corporation,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other
organizational document of Shareholder. 
---|--- 



     | (d) | Shareholder is the record and beneficial owner of, or is the
trustee that is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the
beneficial owners of, and has good title to all of the Shares, and the Shares
are owned free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other
encumbrances. The Shares do not include shares over which Shareholder
exercises control in a fiduciary capacity for any other person or entity that
is not an Affiliate of Shareholder, and no representation by Shareholder is
made with respect thereto. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares, and
none of the Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement,
arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of the Shares, except
as contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

_Section 4_. _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof until the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6_ hereof, Shareholder, in
his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Company, shall not, nor shall
such Shareholder authorize any partner, officer, director, advisor
or representative of, such Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates
to (and, to the extent applicable to Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to prohibit any of his, her or its
representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any person (other than Buyer) any information or data with
respect to Company or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c)
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding or similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, (d) solicit proxies with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any party in
taking or planning any action that would compete with, restrain or otherwise
serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, or (e) initiate a
shareholders vote or action by consent of Companys shareholders with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

 _Section 5_. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 5_, by execution of this Agreement, Shareholder does hereby appoint
Buyer with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as Shareholders
true and lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full extent of
Shareholders rights with respect to the Shares, to vote, if Shareholder is
unable to perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement, each of
such Shares that Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the
matters set forth in _Section 1_ hereof at any meeting of the shareholders
of Company, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection
with any action of the shareholders of Company taken by written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of such proxy shall not exercise
such irrevocable

 



A-3  proxy on any matter other than as set forth in _Section 1_. Shareholder
intends this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter
until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section 7_
hereof, and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Shareholder with
respect to the Shares. This irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate
upon the termination of this Agreement. 

_Section 6_. _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys  Fees_. Shareholder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into
the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Buyer if
Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement
and that, in the event of any such failure, Buyer will not have an adequate
remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such
failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that
Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with Buyers seeking or obtaining
such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with
Shareholder, Buyer shall have the right to inform any third party that Buyer
reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with
Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Buyer
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in
activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with Buyer set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by Buyer against such third party.

 

 _Section 7_. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement
shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement by the written agreement of the parties hereto, and shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective
Time, or (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement. Upon such termination, no
party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided,
however, that such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

_Section 8_. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

_Section 9_.  _Severability_. In the event that any one or more provisions
of this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision
which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of this
Agreement.

 



A-4 _Section 10_. _Capacity as Shareholder_. This Agreement shall apply to
Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of Company and it
shall not apply in any manner to Shareholder in his or her capacity as a
director of Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
apply to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of Shareholder to comply
with his or her fiduciary duties as a director of Company, if applicable.

 

 _Section 11_. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
interpreted in accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of the State
of Arkansas, without regard for the law or principles of conflict of laws.

_Section 12_.  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12_.

 

 _Section 13_. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances_. Provided
that the Merger is consummated in compliance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, that the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger is not less
than that specified in the Merger Agreement executed on or about the date
hereof, and that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with
its terms, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Shareholder hereby
waives any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger or demand
fair value for his or her Shares in connection with the Merger, in each case,
that Shareholder may have under applicable law. From time to time prior to
the termination of this Agreement, at Buyers request and without further
consideration, Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable
to effect the actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Shareholder further agrees not to commence or participate in, and
to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against Buyer, Buyer
Bank, Company, Company Bank or any of their respective successors relating to
the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

_Section 14_. _Disclosure_. Shareholder hereby authorizes Company and Buyer
to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus such
Shareholders identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of
Shareholders obligations under this Agreement.

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one instrument.

3\. _Duties_. The Executive is hereby employed as an employee of the Bank and
will [JOB DESCRIPTION], and shall perform for or on behalf of the Bank such
duties as the Bank shall assign from time to time, provided, that the
Executive shall not be nor be deemed to be an "executive officer" of the
Bank within the meaning of Regulation O or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. The Executive shall render his services at the Banks

approved in advance, and other business expenses reasonably incurred in
the performance of his duties under this Agreement.

8\. _Confidentiality/Trade Secrets_. The Executive acknowledges his
position with the Bank is one of the highest trust and confidence both by
reason of his position and by reason of his access to and contact with the
trade secrets and confidential and proprietary business information,
including, but not limited to, data, plans, budgets and customer lists, of
the Bank. Both during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Executive
therefore covenants and agrees as follows:

 

(a) He shall use his best efforts and exercise utmost diligence to protect and
to safeguard the trade secrets and/or confidential and proprietary
information of the Bank, including, but not limited to, the identity of its
current or prospective customers, suppliers and licensors, its arrangements
with its customers, suppliers and licensors, and its technical, financial
and marketing data, records, compilations of information, processes,
programs, methods, techniques and specifications relating to its customers,
suppliers, licensors, products and services;

 

(b) He shall not disclose any of such trade secrets and/or confidential and
proprietary information, except as may be required in the course of his
employment with the Bank or by law; and

(c) He shall not use, directly or indirectly, for his own benefit or for the
benefit of another, any of such trade secrets and/or confidential and
proprietary information.

 



C-2 All files, records, documents, drawings, specifications, memoranda, notes or
other documents relating to the business of the Bank, whether prepared by the
Executive or otherwise coming into his possession, shall be the exclusive
property of the Bank and shall be delivered to the Bank and not reproduced
and/or retained by the Executive upon termination of his employment for any
reason whatsoever or at any other time upon request of the Bank.

9.  _Nonsolicitation_. The Executive agrees that, during the period of his
employment and for twelve (12) months after termination of employment, he will
not, either directly or indirectly, for himself or for any third
party, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Bank, which agreement
may be withheld in the Banks sole discretion:

(a) employ or hire any other person who is then employed by the Bank or
solicit, induce, recruit or cause any other person who is then employed by the
Bank to terminate his employment with the Bank; or

 

(b) solicit on behalf of any other bank, or other financial services provider,
any current or prospective customers of the Bank or any other prior persons
or entities which were customers of the Bank during the twelve (12) months
prior to such termination of employment. In the event that a court shall
determine that the provisions of this Section 9 are unenforceable in any
way, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the court shall reform the
provisions to the extent required in order to make them enforceable.

 

10\. _Remedies for Breach of Covenants of the Executive_.

 

(a) The Bank and the Executive specifically acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing covenants of the Executive in Sections 8 and 9 are reasonable in
content and scope and are given by the Executive knowingly, willingly and
voluntarily and for adequate consideration. The Bank and the Executive further
acknowledge and agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other appropriate authority shall disagree with the parties foregoing
agreement as to reasonableness, then such court or other authority shall
reform or otherwise modify the foregoing covenants only so far as necessary to
be enforceable.

 

(b) The covenants set forth in Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement shall
continue to be binding upon the Executive, notwithstanding the termination of
his employment with the Bank for any reason whatsoever. Such covenants shall
be deemed and construed as separate agreements independent of any other
provisions of this Agreement and any other agreement between the Bank and
the Executive. The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive
against the Bank, unless predicated on this Agreement, shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by the Bank of any or all such covenants. It is
expressly agreed that the remedy at law for the breach of any such covenant
is inadequate, injunctive relief and specific performance shall be available
to prevent the breach or any threatened breach thereof and that the party
bringing the claim shall not be required to post bond in pursuit of such
claim. For any such claim, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
its or his attorneys fees and costs incurred in pursuit of such claim to the
extent permitted by law.

 



C-3 11\. _Termination_. This Agreement (other than Sections 8, 9 and 10 hereof,
which shall survive any termination hereof for any reason) may be terminated
as follows:

(a) The Bank may terminate this Agreement and the Executives employment
hereunder at any time, with or without cause, and if without cause, upon at
least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Executive. The Executive
may terminate this Agreement and his employment hereunder, at any time, for
good reason or no reason, upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice
to the Bank, and "good reason" with respect to Executive shall mean (i) the
Bank breaches this Agreement in any material respect and fails to cure such
breach within thirty (30) days after Executive delivers written notice and a
written description of such breach to the Bank; (ii) the Bank reduces the
Executives Base Salary; (iii) the Bank materially diminishes the Executives
authority, duties, or responsibilities; or (iv) the Executive is transferred
to an office greater than [ten/fifteen] [(10/15)] miles from the current
location of the Executives office. The Executive shall not be deemed to have
resigned for good reason unless and until there is delivered to the Banks
Director of Human Resources written notice of the Executives ground for
resignation fully explaining his contention that good reason exists for his
resignation and the Director of Human Resources has been provided at least
thirty (30) days following the receipt of this written notice to respond to
the Executives stated concerns and attempt to cure the same.

 

(b) For purposes of this Section 11, "cause" with respect to the Executive
shall mean actions or omissions of the Executive which reflect fraud,
dishonesty, gross dereliction of duty, or actions willfully taken in disregard
of the interests of the Bank. Whether "cause" exists shall be determined in
the sole and good faith discretion of the Board of Directors of the Bank, or
a committee thereof ("Board"). If the Bank wishes to terminate the Executives
employment with "cause," the Board shall first provide the Executive a written
statement of its grounds for proposing to make such determination, and the
Executive shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to make written and, if
approved by the Board in its sole discretion, oral, presentation to the
members of the Board to refute the grounds for proposed termination. 

(c) In the event that the Bank terminates the Executives employment with
cause, the Bank shall pay the Executive all accrued and unpaid Base Salary up
to the date of termination, and shall reimburse the Executive for all
unreimbursed but reimbursable expenses incurred by the Executive up to the
date of termination, in accordance with the Banks reimbursement policy
on expense reimbursement for its officers similarly situated to the
Executive, and the Executive shall not be eligible for or entitled to any
further compensation or benefits from the Bank except for any post-employment
continuation of COBRA benefits elected to be received by the Executive solely
at his own expense.

(d) In the event that the Bank terminates the Executives employment without
cause during the Term of this Agreement or the Executive terminates his
employment for good reason, and, solely in exchange for Executives execution
and delivery of the Banks then standard separation agreement,
which includes, among other obligations, a full release of claims against the
Bank and related entities and persons, within the time period specified
therein, and upon such agreement becoming effective by its terms, the Bank
shall pay the Executive an amount equal to his accrued vacation plus the Base
Salary for the remainder of the Term of this Agreement. Such payments shall be
made in one lump sum as soon as administratively feasible after the
termination. In addition, the Bank shall pay the Executive all unreimbursed
but reimbursable

 



C-4  expenses incurred by the Executive up to the date of termination, in
accordance with the Banks reimbursement policy on expense reimbursement for
its officers similarly situated to the Executive, and the Executive shall not
be eligible for or entitled to any further compensation or benefits from the
Bank except for any post-employment continuation of COBRA benefits elected to
be received by the Executive solely at his own expense. 

(e) In the event that the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment
pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof without good reason, the Bank shall pay the
Executive all accrued and unpaid Base Salary up to the date of termination,
and shall reimburse the Executive for all unreimbursed but reimbursable
expenses incurred by the Executive up to the date of termination, in
accordance with the Banks reimbursement policy on expense reimbursement for
its officers similarly situated to the Executive, and the Executive shall not
be eligible for or entitled to any further compensation or benefits from the
Bank except for any post-employment continuation of COBRA benefits elected to
be received by the Executive solely at his own expense.

(f) In spite of anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Term if the Executive dies or
becomes permanently disabled. As used in this paragraph, "permanently
disabled" is defined as the inability of the Executive to perform the
essential functions of his position, either with or without reasonable
accommodation, for a period extending beyond six (6) months. In the event this
Agreement terminates prior to the expiration of the Term in connection with
Executives death or Executive becomes permanently disabled, the Bank shall
pay the Executive or the Executives estate, as the case may be, 50% of the
Executives Base Salary for the remainder of the Term of this Agreement, made
in one lump sum as soon as administratively feasible after the termination,
plus all unreimbursed but reimbursable expenses incurred by the Executive up
to the date of termination, in accordance with the Banks reimbursement
policy on expense reimbursement for its officers similarly situated to the
Executive.
