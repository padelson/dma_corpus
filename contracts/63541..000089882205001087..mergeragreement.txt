          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of August 22, 2005, among
WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), WHIRLPOOL ACQUISITION
CO., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("SUB"), and
MAYTAG CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY").

          WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

          WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger (the "MERGER") of
Sub into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement; and

          WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.01 THE MERGER. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"). The Merger, the payment of cash and
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON
STOCK") in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are referred to herein as the "TRANSACTIONS".

     SECTION 1.02 CLOSING. The closing (the "CLOSING") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York 10153 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day following the
satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing), or, if on such day any condition set
forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof and other than those conditions that by their nature are to be fulfilled
at the Closing), as soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in
Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by
the parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and
date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "CLOSING DATE".

     SECTION 1.03 EFFECTIVE TIME. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare,
and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the Surviving
Corporation shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER")

<PAGE>



executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such
Secretary of State, or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

     SECTION 1.04 EFFECTS. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL.

     SECTION 1.05 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS. (a) The certificate
of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

          (b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

     SECTION 1.06 DIRECTORS. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

     SECTION 1.07 OFFICERS. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

                                   ARTICLE II

                       EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     SECTION 2.01 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK")
or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

          (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

          (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to Sections 2.01(b),
2.02(a) and 2.02(b), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock
shall be

<PAGE>
                                       2

converted into the right to receive (x) $10.50 in cash, without interest, and
(y) that number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together, the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION").

          (d) EFFECT OF CONVERSION. From and after the Effective Time, all of
the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.01 shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate (each a "CERTIFICATE") theretofore representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any
dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.03(d) and 2.03(f)
and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.03(e).

          (e) CHANGES TO STOCK. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, split-up,
exchange or readjustment of shares, rights issued in respect of Parent Common
Stock or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

          (f) DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement:

          "EXCHANGE RATIO" means the quotient obtained by dividing $10.50 by the
20-Day Average Price and rounding to the nearest 1/10,000; provided that if the
20-Day Average Price is less than $75.1039, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.1398;
and if the 20-Day Average Price is greater than $91.7937, the Exchange Ratio
shall be equal to 0.1144.

          "20-DAY AVERAGE PRICE" shall mean the average (rounded to nearest
1/10,000), of the volume weighted averages (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000), of
the trading prices of the Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (the "NYSE") as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other
source as the parties shall agree in writing) for each of the 20 consecutive
trading days ending on and including the second trading day prior to the Closing
Date.

     SECTION 2.02 APPRAISAL RIGHTS; STOCK OPTIONS; AFFILIATES.

          (a) APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares ("APPRAISAL SHARES") of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies with, Section 262 of the DGCL
("SECTION 262") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to
the rights provided for under Section 262; provided, however, that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262, then such holder's Appraisal Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted as of

                                       3

the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c) and unpaid
dividends and other distributions as provided in Section 2.03(d). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

          (b) STOCK OPTIONS AND EQUITY AWARDS.

               (1) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY BOARD"),
or the appropriate committee thereof, shall take such action as is necessary so
that at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") granted under the Company Stock
Plans, whether or not vested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock, and shall thereafter constitute an option to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option
pursuant to the relevant Company Stock Plan under which it was issued and the
agreement evidencing the grant thereof prior to the Effective Time, the number
(rounded to the nearest whole number) of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) two times the Exchange Ratio. The exercise price or base price per share of
Parent Common Stock subject to any such Company Stock Option at and after the
Effective Time shall be an amount (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a
cent) equal to (A) the exercise price or base price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time divided
by (B) two times the Exchange Ratio. The parties acknowledge that as of the
Effective Time, all Company Stock Options granted under the 2002 Employee and
Director Stock Incentive Plan, the 1998 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option
Plan, the 2000 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the 1996 Employee Stock Incentive
Plan, the 1992 Stock Option Plan for Executives and Key Employees and the 1989
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, if unvested, shall vest in full
and shall remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan
documents and award agreements for each such Company Stock Option. The parties
will make good faith efforts to make equitable adjustments to ensure that the
conversions of Company Stock Options contemplated by this Section 2.02(b)(1)
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

               (2) At the Effective Time, (i) each restricted stock unit or
performance unit granted under the Company Stock Plans, if unvested, shall vest
in full and be settled for a cash payment to the holder of such award equal to
$10.50 plus (A) the Exchange Ratio times (B) the closing price of the Parent
Common Stock on the Closing Date per unit; and (ii) each award granted under the
Company's Performance Incentive Award Plan and the Company's Executive Economic
Profit Plan (together, the "CASH LTIPS") shall vest and be settled in cash
(based on a per share valuation equal to $10.50 plus (A) the Exchange Ratio
times (B) the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date) at
the Effective Time at 100% of target.

<PAGE>
                                       4

               (3) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to assume as
of the Effective Time the Company's obligations under the Company Stock Options
and to otherwise effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.02(b), and shall
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.02(b). Effective as
of the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on an appropriate form or a
post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement under the
Securities Act with respect to the Parent Common Stock subject to Company Stock
Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein), as well as comply with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such options remain outstanding.

               (4) For purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY STOCK PLANS" mean
the 2002 Employee and Director Stock Incentive Plan, the 1998 Non-Employee
Directors' Stock Option Plan, the 2000 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the 1996
Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the 1992 Stock Option Plan for Executives and Key
Employees, the 1989 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the
Company's Employee Discount Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP").

          (c) COMPANY AFFILIATES. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor)
shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any "AFFILIATE" of the
Company (identified pursuant to Section 6.13) until such person shall have
delivered to Parent duly executed Affiliate Agreements as contemplated by
Section 6.13. Such persons shall be subject to the restrictions described in
such agreements, and such shares (or certificates therefor) shall bear a legend
describing such restrictions.

     SECTION 2.03 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

          (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock or such other exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and
non-certificated shares represented by book entry ("BOOK ENTRY SHARES") for the
Merger Consideration. Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent, at or
prior to the Effective Time, the cash and Parent Common Stock to be delivered in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock (such cash and Parent Common Stock
being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND"). Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time
a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent or by appropriate
guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this
nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or trust company
in the United States) in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the
Exchange Agent. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in
accordance with

<PAGE>
                                       5

Parent's customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book
entry.

          (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (A) one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and (B) a check in the amount
equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this Article II,
including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e)
and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.03(d). No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional
shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration and any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Sections 2.03(d) and 2.03(f), and any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.03(e).

          (c) CERTIFICATE HOLDER. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is
to be registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the
name of a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

          (d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are properly surrendered. Following such
surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of
such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.
For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent
Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

     (e) FRACTIONAL SHARES.

<PAGE>
                                       6

               (1) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled
to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.03(e), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock representing such holder's proportionate interest, if any, in the
proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the excess of (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.03(b) (such excess being herein called the "EXCESS SHARES"). As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of the Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall
sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner
provided in the following paragraph.

               (2) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent
for the holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be
executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such
sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMMON SHARES TRUST"). Parent shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transactions costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in
connection with such sale of Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine
the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such
holder of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.

               (3) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu
of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock without
interest, subject to and in accordance with this Section 2.03.

     (f) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay
any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior
to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and
after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

<PAGE>
                                       7

the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

          (g) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

          (h) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash or Parent Common
Stock from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise irrevocably
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

          (i) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination
thereof; provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three months from the date of the investment therein. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

          (j) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "CODE"), or under any other provision of
applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of the shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

          (k) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of such lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed

                                       8

Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that, except as
set forth in the disclosure letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from
the Company to Parent and Sub (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER") or in any
Company SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (each, a "FILED COMPANY SEC Document"):


     SECTION 3.01 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (each, a "COMPANY SUBSIDIARY") (a) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized, other than defects in such organization, existence or
good standing that, individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (b) has full corporate
power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, other than such corporate power and authority, franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually
and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary
or the failure to so qualify would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete
copies of the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the
date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "COMPANY CHARTER"), and the by-laws
of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the
"COMPANY BY-LAWS").

     SECTION 3.02 COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES: EQUITY INTERESTS.

          (a) Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each
"SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY", as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X
under the Exchange Act and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by another
Company Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and
clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS").

          (b) Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, equity membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest
in any person.

     SECTION 3.03 CAPITAL STRUCTURE. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 24,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share ("COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"
and, together with the Company

<PAGE>
                                       9

Common Stock, the "COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK"). At the close of business on July 31,
2005, (i) 79,943,633 shares of Company Common Stock (each together with a
Company Right) and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 37,206,960 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company in its treasury, (iii) 7,521,608 shares of Company Common Stock were
subject to outstanding Company Stock Options and 891,921 additional shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock
Plans, (other than any shares reserved under the Employee Discount Stock
Purchase Plan) and (iv) 4,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock were
reserved for issuance in connection with the rights (the "COMPANY RIGHTS")
issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of February 12, 1998 (as
amended from time to time, the "COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), between the Company
and Computershare Investor Services, LLC, as Rights Agent. Except as set forth
above, at the close of business on July 31, 2005, no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. During the period from July 31, 2005 to the date of this Agreement,
(x) there have been no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company other than issuances of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on
such date as required by their terms as in effect on the date of such issuance
and (y) there have been no issuances by the Company of options, warrants or
other rights to acquire shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
the Company. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights linked to the
price of the Company Common Stock that were not granted in tandem with a related
Company Stock Option. All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are, and
all such shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of
first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under
any provision of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or any
Contract to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. There are not any
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right
to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matters on which holders of Company Capital Stock may vote
("VOTING COMPANY DEBT"). Except as set forth above, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are not any options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold,
additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests in, or any security
convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of or
other equity interest in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any Voting
Company Debt, (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, security,
unit, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii) that give any
person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or derived
from the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of Company Capital
Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. The Company has made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the Company Rights Agreement, as amended to the date of this
Agreement.

<PAGE>
                                       10

          (b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a true,
complete and correct list of all outstanding Company Stock Options, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option, the
grant dates, exercise prices, expiration dates and vesting schedule of each such
Company Stock Option and the names of the holders of each Company Stock Option.
All outstanding Company Stock Options are evidenced by the forms of Company
Stock Option agreements delivered or made available to Parent, and no Company
Stock Option agreement contains terms that are materially inconsistent with, or
in addition in any material respect to, the terms contained therein.

     SECTION 3.04 AUTHORITY; EXECUTION AND DELIVERY; ENFORCEABILITY. (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions to be
performed or consummated by the Company. The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and
the other Transactions to be performed or consummated by the Company have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this
Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights, and to general equity
principles.

          (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted
resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions
to be performed or consummated by the Company, (ii) determining that the terms
of the Merger and the other Transactions to be performed or consummated by the
Company are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to a vote at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (iv) recommending that the Company's stockholders
adopt this Agreement and (v) declaring the advisability of this Agreement.
Assuming that the representation set forth in the second sentence of Section
4.03(c) is true and correct, such resolutions of the Company Board are
sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and Sub and this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions (i) the restrictions on "BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL and (ii) the provisions of
Article Eleventh of the Company Charter. To the Company's knowledge, no other
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
Transaction.

          (c) Assuming that the representation set forth in the second sentence
of Section 4.03(c) is true and correct, the only vote of holders of any class or
series of Company Capital Stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger is the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the
"COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"). The affirmative vote of the holders of Company
Capital Stock, or any of them, is not necessary to consummate any Transaction
other than the Merger.

     SECTION 3.05 NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. (a) The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other

<PAGE>
                                       11

Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without the lapse of time or the
giving of notice, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit
under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any
provision of (i) the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable
charter or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any
contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, permit, concession,
franchise or other instrument (a "CONTRACT") to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets
is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order or decree ("JUDGMENT") or statute, law
(including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation ("LAW") applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization
("CONSENT") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from, any
federal, state, local or foreign government or any court of competent
jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"), is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i) compliance
with and filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended (the "HSR ACT"), (ii) any additional Consents and filings under any
foreign Antitrust Laws (including, if applicable, the competition or antitrust
laws of Mexico and Brazil, and the Competition Act (Canada)) or under the
Investment Canada Act (Canada), (iii) the filing with the SEC of (A) a proxy or
information statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders (the "PROXY STATEMENT") and (B) such reports under, or
other applicable requirements of, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), as may be required in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (iv) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions
in which the Company is qualified to do business, (v) compliance with and such
filings as may be required under applicable Environmental Laws, (vi) such
filings as may be required in connection with the Taxes described in Section

DATE" (as each such term is defined in the Company Rights Agreement) shall not

     SECTION 3.06 SEC DOCUMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. (a) The Company has
filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to
be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2003 pursuant to Sections
13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS").

          (b) As of its respective date, each Company SEC Document complied as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable
to such Company SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that
information contained in any Filed Company SEC Document has been revised or
superseded by a later filed Filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC
Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Documents (including the related notes and schedules thereto)
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

          (c) Other than liabilities or obligations (i) disclosed or provided
for in the financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents or
(ii) incurred since March 31, 2005 in the ordinary course of business, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to
be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries or in the notes thereto and that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the
Exchange Act (collectively, the "SARBANES-OXLEY ACT") with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the Company has delivered to Parent a summary of any
disclosure made by the Company's management to the Company's auditors and audit
committee referred to in such certifications. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER" and "PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER" shall
have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

<PAGE>
                                       13

          (e) The Company has (i) designed and maintained disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports it files under the Exchange Act is made known to its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer or other appropriate members
of management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; (ii) designed and maintained a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including reasonable assurance (A) that
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations and recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability and (B)
regarding prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements; (iii) with the participation of the Company's principal
executive and financial officers, completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
January 1, 2005, and such assessment concluded that such internal controls were
effective using the framework specified in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for such year ended; and (iv) to the extent required by applicable Law,
disclosed in such report or in any amendment thereto any change in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period
covered by such report or amendment that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

          (f) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information
and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. The Company has identified, based on the most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, for the Company's
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls. The Company has provided
to Parent true and correct copies of any of the foregoing disclosures to the
auditors or audit committee that have been made in writing from January 1, 2003
through the date hereof, and will promptly provide Parent true and correct
copies of any such disclosure that is made after the date hereof.

          (g) None of the Company Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since
January 1, 2003 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a)
and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          (h) As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company,
there is no applicable accounting rule, consensus or pronouncement that has been
adopted by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Emerging
Issues Task Force or any similar body

<PAGE>
                                       14

but that is not in effect as of the date of this Agreement that, if implemented,
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (i) There are no pending (A) formal or, to the knowledge of the
Company, informal investigations of the Company by the SEC, (B) to the knowledge
of the Company, inspections of an audit of the Company's financial statements by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or (C) investigations by the audit
committee of the Company Board regarding any complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in improper or
illegal accounting or auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate
internal accounting controls. The Company will promptly provide to Parent
information as to any such matters that arise after the date hereof.

          (j) Since July 30, 2002, the Company has been in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in
effect from time to time.

          (k) Since the date of the Company's 2004 annual meeting of
stockholders, the Company has been in compliance with the applicable corporate
governance listing standards of the NYSE in all material respects.

     SECTION 3.07 INFORMATION SUPPLIED.

          (a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein.

          (b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the time the Form S-4 or any such amendment or
supplement becomes effective under the Securities Act or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be included in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

     SECTION 3.08 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. From the date of the
most recent audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents to the date of this Agreement, the Company has conducted its business
only in the ordinary course, and during such period there has not been:

                    (i) any event, change, effect, development, condition or

          compensation, benefits, perquisites or any bonus or award, except for
          grants of normal cash bonus opportunities and normal increases of cash
          compensation (including compensation in connection with new hires), in
          each case in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

          of the date of the most recent audited financial statements included
          in the Filed Company SEC Documents, (B) any payment of any bonus to

          severance, change in control, termination or similar compensation, pay
          or benefits or increases therein, except (x) as was required under any
          employment, severance or termination agreements in effect as of the
          date of the most recent audited financial statements included in the
          Filed Company SEC Documents, (y) in the ordinary course of business
          consistent with past practice in connection with new hires to replace

          the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or (D)
          any entry by the Company or any Company Subsidiary into, or any

<PAGE>
                                       16

                    (viii) any revaluation by the Company or any Company
          Subsidiary of any of the assets of the Company or any Company
          Subsidiary, except insofar as may have been required by applicable Law
          or that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
          Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.09 TAXES. (a) As used in this Agreement:

          "TAXES" shall mean all (i) federal, state and local, domestic and
foreign, taxes, assessments, duties or similar charges of any kind whatsoever,
including all corporate franchise, income, sales, use, ad valorem, receipts,
value added, profits, license, withholding, employment, excise, property, net
worth, capital gains, transfer, stamp, documentary, social security, payroll,
environmental, alternative minimum, occupation, recapture and other taxes, and
including any interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such
amounts; (ii) liability for the payment of any amounts of the type described in
clause (i) as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated,

to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) or (ii).

          "TAXING AUTHORITY" shall mean any federal, state or local, domestic or
foreign, governmental body (including any subdivision, agency or commission
thereof), or any quasi-governmental body, in each case, exercising regulatory
authority in respect of Taxes.

          "TAX RETURN" shall mean all returns, declarations of estimated tax
payments, reports, estimates, information returns and statements, including any
related or supporting information with respect to any of the foregoing, filed or
to be filed with any Taxing Authority in connection with the determination,
assessment, collection or administration of any Taxes.

          (b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed, or has
caused to be timely filed on its behalf, all material Tax Returns required to be
filed by or on behalf of the Company and each Company Subsidiary in the manner
prescribed by applicable Law. All such Tax Returns are complete and correct,
except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
has timely paid (or the Company has paid on each such Company Subsidiary's
behalf) all Taxes due and owing, and, in accordance with GAAP, the most recent
financial statements contained in the Filed Company SEC Documents reflect a
reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes) for all Taxes payable by the
Company and each Company Subsidiary for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statement, in each case except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) No Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is under
audit or examination by any Taxing Authority, and no written notice or, to the
knowledge of the Company, unwritten notice of such an audit or examination has
been received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Each material assessed
deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating to Taxes by any
Taxing Authority has been timely paid and there is no assessed deficiency,
refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to
any Taxes due and owing by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The federal
income

Tax Returns of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been examined by the
Internal Revenue Service or the relevant statute of limitations has closed for
all years through 1997.

          (d) There is no agreement or other document extending, or having the
effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of any material
Taxes and no power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes has been executed
or filed with any Taxing Authority by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

          (e) No material Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any assets or
properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for statutory liens
for Taxes not yet due.

          (f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
bound by any material Tax sharing agreement, material Tax indemnity obligation
or similar material agreement or arrangement with respect to Taxes (including
any advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to
Taxes with any Taxing Authority), other than any such agreements (i) with
customers, vendors, lessors or similar persons entered into in the ordinary
course of business and (ii) among the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

          (g) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary has complied with all applicable Laws relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any federal,
state or local, domestic or foreign, Laws) and has, within the time and the
manner prescribed by applicable Law, withheld from and paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under
applicable Law.

          (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or has been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code.

          (i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required
to include in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date taxable income
attributable to income that accrued in a prior taxable period but was not
recognized in any prior taxable period as a result of the installment method of
accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash method of
accounting or Section 481 of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local
or foreign Tax law.

          (j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in
any "LISTED TRANSACTION" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4.

     SECTION 3.10 ABSENCE OF CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLANS. (a) From the date of the
most recent audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents to the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has terminated, adopted, amended, modified or agreed to terminate,
adopt, amend or modify (or announced an intention to terminate, adopt, amend or
modify), in any material respect, any collective bargaining agreement or any
bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,

                                       18

bonus, cafeteria, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit, vacation,
severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other welfare
benefit or other plan, program, arrangement or understanding, whether oral or
written, formal or informal, funded or unfunded (whether or not legally
binding), maintained, contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed
to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other person or entity that,
together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, is treated as a single
employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any other
applicable Law (each, a "COMMONLY CONTROLLED ENTITY"), in each case providing
benefits to any Participant and whether or not subject to United States law (all
such plans, programs, arrangements and understandings, including any such plan,
program, arrangement or understanding entered into or adopted on or after the
date of this Agreement, "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS") or has made any change, in any
material respect, in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate funding
obligations with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is a Company Pension
Plan, or any change, in any material respect, in the manner in which
contributions to any such Company Pension Plan are made or the basis on which
such contributions are determined.

          (b) Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and correct list of (i) any material employment, deferred compensation,
severance, change in control, termination, employee benefit, loan (other than
Participant loans under any Company Pension Plan that includes a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code),
indemnification, retention, stock repurchase, stock option, consulting or
similar agreement, commitment or obligation between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Participant, on the other hand, and (ii)
any agreement between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and any Participant, on the other hand, the benefits of which are contingent, or
the terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of transactions
involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the nature contemplated by
this Agreement (all such agreements, collectively, the "COMPANY BENEFIT
AGREEMENTS").

     SECTION 3.11 ERISA COMPLIANCE; EXCESS PARACHUTE PAYMENTS.

          (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and correct list of all Company Benefit Plans that are "EMPLOYEE
PENSION BENEFIT PLANS" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (all such plans,
collectively, the "COMPANY PENSION PLANS") or "EMPLOYEE WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other material Company Benefit
Plans; provided, however, that no Company Benefit Agreement shall be deemed a
Company Benefit Plan or listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in compliance with its
terms and applicable Law, and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreements, except to the extent that the failure to comply with any such terms
or Law, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan
and each Company Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any unwritten Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, a description thereof), (ii) the most
recent annual report on Form 5500 (including accompanying schedules and
attachments) with respect to each Company Benefit Plan for which such a report
is required, (iii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company
Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is required under

<PAGE>
                                       19

ERISA, (iv) each material trust agreement and material group annuity contract
relating to the funding or payment of benefits under any Company Benefit Plan,
(v) the most recent determination or qualification letter issued by the Internal
Revenue Service for each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify for favorable
tax treatment in the United States of America, as well as a true, correct and
complete copy of each pending application for such letter, if applicable, and
(vi) the most recent actuarial valuation, if applicable, for each Company
Pension Plan.

          (b) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified have been
the subject of determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to all tax Law changes through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to which a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service can be obtained to the effect that such Company Pension
Plans are qualified and exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been
revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened,
nor has any such Company Pension Plan been amended since the date of its most
recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its costs or require
security under Section 307 of ERISA. All Company Pension Plans that are required
to have been approved by any non-U.S. Governmental Entity have been so approved.

          (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has maintained,
contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has any
liability under, any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.
With respect to the Maytag Corporation Employees Retirement Plan (the "US
PENSION PLAN"), to the knowledge of the Company there has been no material
adverse change in the financial condition of such plan from the date of the most
recent audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents
to the date of this Agreement, assuming for such purpose that there has been no
change in the discount rate used for purposes of valuing the liabilities of such
plan from the discount rate applied in such financial statements. No liability
under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation) has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated
"SINGLE-EMPLOYER" plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA), currently
or formerly maintained by any of them or by any Commonly Controlled Entity,
except for any such liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of
the Company Pension Plans has an "ACCUMULATED FUNDING DEFICIENCY" (as defined in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, nor has
any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code been requested. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit
Plans, including the Company Pension Plans, or any trusts created thereunder or
any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan or
trust created thereunder, or any agents of the foregoing, has engaged in a
"PROHIBITED TRANSACTION" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) that would be reasonably expected to subject the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of the
Company Benefit Plans, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator of any

<PAGE>
                                       20

Company Benefit Plan or trust created thereunder to the tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 of the Code or to the
sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or to any other liability for breach of
fiduciary duty under ERISA, except for any such prohibited transactions that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No Company Pension Plan or related trust has
been terminated during the last five years, nor has there been any "REPORTABLE
EVENT" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA), other than an event for which the
30-day notice period has been waived, with respect to any Company Pension Plan
since January 1, 2004, and no notice of a reportable event will be required to
be filed in connection with the Transactions. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability that has not been
satisfied in full as a result of a "COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL" or a "PARTIAL
WITHDRAWAL" (as each such term is defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA) during the past six years from any "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

          (d) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan, whether or not subject to ERISA, such Company Benefit Plan
is either funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "WELFARE
BENEFITS FUND" (as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) or it is unfunded.

          (e) Other than payments or benefits that may be made to the persons
listed in Section 3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a "PRIMARY
COMPANY EXECUTIVE"), no amount or other entitlement that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of
the Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event) by any
Participant who is a "DISQUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL" (as defined in final Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) (each, a "DISQUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL") under any
Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or other compensation
arrangement currently in effect would be an "EXCESS PARACHUTE PAYMENT" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no such Disqualified Individual
is entitled to receive any additional payment (e.g., any tax gross-up or any
other payment) from the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other person
in the event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is
imposed on such Disqualified Individual. The Company has provided Parent with
calculations performed in 2004 by Hewitt Associates of the estimated amounts of
compensation and benefits that could be received (whether in cash or property or
the vesting of property) by certain Primary Company Executives as a result of a
transaction of the nature contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in
combination with any other event), and the "BASE AMOUNT" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code) for certain Primary Company Executives, in each case as
of the date specified in such calculations and in accordance with the
assumptions made by Hewitt Associates as set forth in such calculations. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company provided true and complete compensation
and benefit information and data to Hewitt Associates necessary to perform such
calculations, which information and data was correct in all material respects as
of the date provided by the Company to Hewitt Associates.

          (f) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms
hereof will not (either alone or in combination with any other event) (i)
entitle any Participant to any additional compensation, severance, termination,
change in control or other benefits or any benefits the value of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the Transactions (alone or in

<PAGE>
                                       21

combination with any other event), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise)
of any compensation, severance or other benefits under, or increase the amount
payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, or (iii) trigger the forgiveness of
indebtedness owed by any Participant to the Company or any of its affiliates.

          (g) Since January 1, 2004, and through the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice of, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no (i) material pending termination
proceedings or other suits, claims (except claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of the Company Benefit Plans), actions or proceedings against
or involving or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (ii) pending investigations (other
than routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, except for any such suits, claims,
proceedings or investigations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with the
Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements that are required to have
been made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been timely made,
accrued or reserved for, except for failures to make, accrue or reserve for any
such contributions, premiums and benefit payments that, individually or
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

          (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability
or obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide
services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and treating such persons as
consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, except for any such liabilities or obligations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (i) The Agreement for the Trust for Maytag Corporation Non-Qualified
Deferred Compensation Plans dated as of October 1, 2003 (the "TRUST AGREEMENT"),
by and between the Company and KeyBank National Association, and each Plan (as
such term is defined in the Trust Agreement) has been amended to provide that no
funding shall be required in connection with the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions. With respect to the Maytag Corporation
Supplemental Retirement Plan II, the Maytag Corporation Deferred Compensation
Plan II, their predecessor plans and any trust agreements relating to the
payment of benefits under these plans, all necessary actions have been taken to
ensure that no funding shall be required in connection with the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

          (j) Except for any items that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
Company Benefit Plans maintained primarily for the benefit of Participants
principally employed in jurisdictions other than the United States of America
(all such plans, collectively, the "NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS") have been
maintained in accordance with their terms and all applicable legal requirements,
(ii) if any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is intended to qualify for special tax
treatment,

<PAGE>
                                       22

such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan meets all requirements for such treatment, and (iii)
the fair market value of the assets of each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be
funded, the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to
be funded, and the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to provide for the
accrued benefit obligations under each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.

     SECTION 3.12 LITIGATION. There are no suits, actions or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company
or any Company Subsidiary (and the Company is not aware of any basis for any
such suit, action or proceeding) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, nor are there
any Judgments outstanding against the Company or any Company Subsidiary that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.13 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their relevant personnel and operations are in compliance with
all applicable Laws, including those relating to occupational health and safety,
except for such failure to be in compliance as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
communication during the past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges
that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material
respect with any applicable Law, except for such failure to be in compliance as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
in effect all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, authorizations,
operating certificates, franchises, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities (collectively, "PERMITS"), necessary or advisable for them to own,
lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses as
now conducted, except for such Permits the absence of which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and there has occurred no violation of, default (with or without
the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) under, or event giving to
others any right of termination, amendment or cancellation of, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, any such Permit, except for any such
violations, defaults or events that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
event which, to the knowledge of the Company, would reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification of
any such Permit, except for any such events that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. This Section 3.13 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes,
which are the subject of Section 3.09.

     SECTION 3.14 LABOR MATTERS. Since January 1, 2004 to the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has experienced any
material labor strikes, union organization attempts, requests for
representation, work slowdowns or stoppages or disputes due to labor
disagreements, and to the knowledge of the Company there is currently no such
action threatened against or affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are each, and since January 1, 2002
have each been, in compliance with all applicable Laws with respect to labor
relations, employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and

<PAGE>
                                       23

hours, human rights, pay equity and workers compensation, except to the extent
that the failure to comply with any such Law, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
is not, and since January 1, 2002 has not, engaged in any unfair labor practice
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint against the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case, before the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable federal, state, provincial or foreign agency
or authority, except for any such charges or complaints that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. No grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out of a
collective bargaining agreement is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for any such
grievances or proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

          (a) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance

Subsidiaries has received any written communication from a Governmental Entity
that alleges that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation
of, or has liability under, any Environmental Law.

          (b) (i) Except for such matters that, individually or in the

authorizations pursuant to Environmental Law (collectively "ENVIRONMENTAL
PERMITS") necessary for their operations as presently conducted, (ii) all such
Environmental Permits are valid and in good standing and (iii) since January 1,
2003, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been advised

threatened, against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

to form the basis of any Environmental Claim against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or against any person whose liabilities for such
Environmental Claims the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has, or may
have, retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of law.

          (f) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate,

Subsidiary or (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, any other property leased
or operated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

          (g) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to
the knowledge of the Company, any asbestos-containing material that is at, under
or about property owned, operated or leased by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is non-friable or encapsulated and in good condition according to the
generally accepted standards and practices governing such material, and its
presence or condition does not violate or otherwise require abatement or removal
pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law.

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 4.02 CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of 250,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of

all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub. Parent, as sole
stockholder of Sub, shall adopt this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable
following its execution. Each of Parent and Sub has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to

equity principles. To the Parent's knowledge, no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to Parent with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction.

     SECTION 4.05 NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. (a) The execution and delivery by each

and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without the
lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary

organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiaries, (ii) any Contract to which
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and
other matters referred to in Section 4.05(b), any Judgment or Law applicable to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any

other items that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) Parent and the Board of Directors of Parent (the "PARENT BOARD")
have taken all action necessary to (i) render the Parent Rights Agreement
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and (ii)
ensure that (A) neither Company nor any of its affiliates or associates is or
will become an "ACQUIRING PERSON" (as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) by
reason of this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction, and (B) a
"DISTRIBUTION DATE" or a "SHARE ACQUISITION DATE" (as each such term is defined
in the Parent Rights Agreement) shall not occur by reason of this Agreement, the
Merger or any other Transaction.

     SECTION 4.06 SEC DOCUMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. (a) Parent has filed

SEC since January 1, 2003 pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange
Act (the "PARENT SEC DOCUMENTS").

          (b) As of its respective date, each Parent SEC Document complied as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Document, and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any Filed Parent
SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed Filed Parent SEC
Document, none of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (including
the related notes and schedules thereto) comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

          (c) Other than liabilities or obligations (i) disclosed or provided
for in the financial statements included in the Filed Parent SEC Documents or
(ii) incurred since June 30, 2005 in the ordinary course of business, neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to
be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries or in the notes thereto and that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer and
former principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and Parent has delivered to the
Company a summary of any disclosure made by Parent's management to Parent's
auditors and audit committee referred to in such certifications. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, "PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER" and "PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL
OFFICER" shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

          (e) Parent has (i) designed and maintained disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports it files under the Exchange Act is made known to its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer or other appropriate members of
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; (ii) designed and maintained

<PAGE>
                                       30

a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including
reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations and recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability and (B) regarding prevention or timely detection
of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a
material effect on Parent's financial statements; (iii) with the participation
of Parent's principal executive and financial officers, completed an assessment
of the effectiveness of Parent's internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2004, and such assessment concluded that such
internal controls were effective using the framework specified in Parent's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for such year ended; and (iv) to the extent required
by applicable Law, disclosed in such report or in any amendment thereto any
change in Parent's internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the period covered by such report or amendment that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Parent's internal
control over financial reporting.

          (f) Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to Parent's auditors and the audit
committee of the Parent Board (i) any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parent's internal control over financial reporting. Parent
has identified, based on the most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, for Parent's auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls. Parent has provided to the Company true and correct copies of any of
the foregoing disclosures to the auditors or audit committee that have been made
in writing from January 1, 2003 through the date hereof, and will promptly
provide the Company true and correct copies of any such disclosure that is made
after the date hereof.

          (g) None of the Parent Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since
January 1, 2003 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a)
and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          (h) As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent,
there is no applicable accounting rule, consensus or pronouncement that has been
adopted by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Emerging
Issues Task Force or any similar body but that is not in effect as of the date
of this Agreement that, if implemented, would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (i) There are no pending (A) formal or, to the knowledge of Parent,
informal investigations of Parent by the SEC, (B) to the knowledge of Parent,
inspections of an audit of Parent's financial statements by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board or (C) investigations by the audit committee of the
Parent Board regarding any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in improper or illegal accounting or
auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal accounting

                                       31

controls. Parent will promptly provide to the Company information as to any such
matters that arise after the date hereof.

          (j) Since July 30, 2002, Parent has been in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in effect
from time to time.

          (k) Since the date of Parent's 2004 annual meeting of stockholders,
Parent has been in compliance with the applicable corporate governance listing
standards of the NYSE in all material respects.

     SECTION 4.07 INFORMATION SUPPLIED.

          (a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, will, at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
Act or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation is made by Parent with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Company in writing for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

          (b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any amendment
or supplement thereto will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's
Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be included in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (c) As of the opening of business on August 8, 2005, to the knowledge
of Parent, Parent has delivered to the Company true and correct copies of all
letters in its possession from Parent's trade customers, retail buying groups
and retail dealer associations regarding Parent's proposed acquisition of the
Company. As of the opening of business on August 8, 2005 and except as
previously disclosed to the Company, Parent has no knowledge of any opposition
of Parent's proposed acquisition of the Company by any trade customers, retail
buying groups or retail dealer associations contacted by Parent in connection
with the Merger.

          in an amount that does not exceed the amount of such type that was
          granted in 2004 shall be conclusively deemed consistent with past
          practice), and implementation of a long-term incentive program for the
          2006-2008 cycle with target amounts and terms consistent with those of
          the Cash LTIPs, each under the Company Stock Plans; and, provided,
          further, that between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the

          freezing of the ESPP, and provide compensation to the extent
          determined in good faith to be necessary to facilitate such a
          settlement;

                    (xvi) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of,
          the foregoing actions.

For the purposes of this Section 5.01(a), "EXCLUDED PARTICIPANTS" shall mean
those Participants (1) listed in Items 1 and 2 of Section 3.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter or (2) that are otherwise employed with the Company at the
level of director or at any more-senior level of employment.

          (b) OTHER ACTIONS. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
the Company Subsidiaries to, take any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being
satisfied, except any action permitted by Section 5.02 or Section 8.01.

          (c) ADVICE OF CHANGES. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any event, change, effect, development, condition or
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY PARENT. Except for matters set forth in
Section 5.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or otherwise expressly permitted
by this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time Parent
shall, and shall cause

<PAGE>
                                       39

each Parent Subsidiary to, conduct its business in the ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as previously conducted and, to the extent
consistent therewith, use commercially reasonable best efforts to preserve
intact its current business organization, keep available the services of its
current officers and employees and keep its relationships with customers,
suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and others having business
dealings with them. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not
permit any Parent Subsidiary to, do any of the following without the prior
written consent of the Company:

                    (i) declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any
          other distributions in respect of (in each case, whether in cash,
          stock or property), any of its capital stock, other than (1) dividends
          and distributions by a direct or indirect wholly owned Parent
          Subsidiary to its parent, (2) regular quarterly cash dividends with
          respect to the Parent Common Stock, with usual declaration, record and
          payment dates or (3) any distribution of stock or property for which
          adjustment is made pursuant to Section 2.01(e);

                    (ii) adopt or propose any change in its certificate of
          incorporation or by-laws or other comparable organizational documents
          in a manner that would adversely affect the economic benefits of the
          Merger or the other Transactions to the Company's stockholders;

                    (iii) engage in any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
          business combination, reorganization, recapitalization or other
          similar transaction unless Parent is the surviving or resulting
          corporation, the shareholders of Parent prior to such transaction own,
          directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting common equity
          interests in the surviving or resulting corporation and such voting
          common equity interests are publicly traded;

                    (iv) take any action that would be reasonably likely to
          prevent, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
          Transactions; or

                    (v) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of, the
          foregoing actions.

     SECTION 5.02 NO SOLICITATION. (a) Subject to Section 5.02(b), from the date
hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary to, and the Company shall direct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any officer, director or employee of,
or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative
(collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") of the Company or any Company Subsidiary not
to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of
any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal, except as contemplated by Section 5.02(b), or (iii)
directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to, or
knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or

<PAGE>
                                       40

may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company. On the date hereof, the Company
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation,
encouragement, discussion, negotiation or other action conducted by the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives with respect
to a Company Takeover Proposal.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(a), from
the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company may, in response to an unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal which
did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a) and which the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial
advisors, may reasonably be expected to lead to a transaction (i) more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal, and
this Agreement (including any amendment to the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger in effect as of the date of such determination) and (ii) that is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, and subject to compliance
with Section 5.02(d), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (excluding the
provisions of the tenth and eleventh paragraphs thereof) and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding
any Company Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that is provided to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided to
Parent, other than any Competitively Sensitive Information.

          (c) Subject to Section 8.01(e), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee
of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any Company
Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve
or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure
to so withdraw or modify its recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement
would be inconsistent with the Company Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties,
the Company Board or any committee thereof may withdraw or modify its
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement.

          (d) The Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of
any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the identity of
the person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or

<PAGE>
                                       41

inquiry and the material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any
change to the terms thereof) of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

          (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

          (f) For purposes of this Agreement:

          "COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means (i) any proposal or offer for a
merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business
combination involving the Company, (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the
Company of over 20% of its equity securities as consideration for the assets or
securities of another person or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company, in each case other than the Merger.

          "SUPERIOR COMPANY PROPOSAL" means any proposal made by a third party
to acquire all or substantially all the equity securities or assets of the
Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, a
liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a sale of all or substantially
all its assets or otherwise, (i) on terms which the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such proposal, and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger) and (ii)
that is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; provided that
the Company Board shall not so determine that any such proposal is a Superior
Company Proposal prior to the time that is 48 hours after the time at which the
Company has complied in all material respects with Section 5.02(d) with respect
to such proposal.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     SECTION 6.01 PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT AND FORM S-4; STOCKHOLDERS
MEETING. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the
Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and
each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. Each
of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act, and for the Proxy Statement to
be cleared by the SEC and its staff under the Exchange Act, as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Without limiting any other provision herein, the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement will contain such information and disclosure
reasonably requested by either Parent or the Company so that the Form S-4
conforms in form and substance to the requirements of the Securities Act and the

<PAGE>
                                       42

Proxy Statement conforms in form and substance to the requirements of the
Exchange Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Company Common Stock as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

          (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies
of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives or
Parent or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff,
on the other hand, with respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and provide to each other all
information necessary in order to prepare the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement
as expeditiously as practicable.

          (c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i)
any event with respect to the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries, or with
respect to other information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement, or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with
respect to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, in either case, which event is required to be described in an
amendment of or a supplement to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, such event
shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, as required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

          (d) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS
MEETING") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that
they give the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger as permitted by Section 5.02(c). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 6.01(d) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company
of any Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the
Company Board of its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.

     SECTION 6.02 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.

          (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to, afford to the
other party and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, shall, and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
party may

<PAGE>
                                       43

reasonably request and receive consistent with the provisions of applicable Law.
All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement dated July 26, 2005 between the Company and Parent
(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 6.02, the Company and Parent shall not be obligated,
and shall not be obligated to cause any of their respective subsidiaries, to
afford the other party or its officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors or other representatives, any access to any properties,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel or records relating to, or in respect
of, any forward product plans, product specific cost information, pricing
information, customer specific information, merchandising information, or other
similar competitively sensitive information ("COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE
INFORMATION").

          (b) To the extent not already done, the Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement request each person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement in connection with its consideration
of acquiring the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to return (or
certify in writing the destruction of) all materials containing confidential
information and copies thereof furnished to such person by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 6.03 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including, without
limitation, those contained in Sections 6.03(b) and (c)), each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
Consents or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have
vacated or reversed any decree, order or judgment entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Board shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, use their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on
the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Parent
and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any filing made with,
or written materials to be submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection
with

<PAGE>
                                       44

the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) promptly inform each other of any
communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to,
the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or any other
Governmental Antitrust Entity and (iii) furnish each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their
subsidiaries or affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent practicable, provide the
other party and its counsel with advance notice of and the opportunity to
participate in any discussion, telephone call or meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection
with the Merger or the other Transactions and to participate in the preparation
for such discussion, telephone call or meeting. The Company and Parent may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.03 as "Antitrust
Counsel Only Material" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.03, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

          (b) (i) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.03, the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided
as promptly as practicable to Governmental Entities with regulatory jurisdiction
over enforcement of any applicable federal, state, local or foreign antitrust,
competition, premerger notification or trade regulation law, regulation or order
("ANTITRUST LAWS" and each such Governmental Entity, a "GOVERNMENTAL ANTITRUST
ENTITY") information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
Transactions, including preparing and filing any notification and report form
and related material required under the HSR Act and any additional Consents and
filings under any Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement (but in no event more than five business days from the date
hereof) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for
additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR
Act and any additional Consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws; (ii) the
parties shall use their best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or
advisable to obtain prompt approval of consummation of the Transactions by any
Governmental Antitrust Entity; and (iii) the parties shall use their best
efforts to resolve any objections and challenges, including by contest through
litigation on the merits, negotiation or other action, that may be asserted by
any Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement under the HSR Act and any Antitrust Laws.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event will Parent or Sub be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could be expected to limit the right
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to own or operate all or any portion of
their respective businesses or assets. With regard to any Governmental Antitrust
Entity, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (or any of their
respective affiliates) shall, without Parent's prior written consent in Parent's
sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or
commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits the Parent's freedom of
action with

<PAGE>
                                       45

respect to, or the Parent's ability to retain any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of, the Surviving Corporation or otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement.

          (d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or
warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          (e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Sub, shall adopt
this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.04 ESPP. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Company
Board administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that with respect to the ESPP no purchase
period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement.

     SECTION 6.05 BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Subject to all applicable collective
bargaining agreements, from the Effective Time through December 31, 2006, except
as set forth below, Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who remain
employed by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries compensation and
employee benefits that, taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (it
being understood and agreed that modifications to Company Benefit Plans that
have been announced to participants or planned and otherwise disclosed to Parent
but not yet implemented as of the Effective Time shall be taken into account for
purposes of the foregoing). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that,
with respect to service through December 31, 2006, it shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain the employer matching contribution component
of the Maytag Corporation Salary Savings Plan without reduction. Parent and the
Company agree and acknowledge that consummation of the Transactions shall
constitute a "change of control" for purposes of each applicable Company Benefit
Plan and Company Benefit Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prohibit Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with the terms thereof and with applicable
Law, so long as they comply with the requirements of this Section 6.05.

          (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their respective terms
(as in effect on August 10, 2005), all the Company Benefit Plans and Company
Benefit Agreements disclosed in Sections 3.10(b) and 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (subject, in each case, to the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof and with applicable Law).

<PAGE>
                                       46

For purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension plans) under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its subsidiaries providing benefits after the Effective Time to any
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time (all such plans, collectively, the "NEW PLANS"), each such
employee shall be credited with all years of service for which such employee was
credited before the Effective Time under any comparable Company Benefit Plans,
except where such crediting would lead to a duplication of benefits or to the
extent such service credit is not provided under a newly adopted plan to
similarly situated employees of Parent who were never employees of the Company
and its affiliates. In addition and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time
to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such plans,
collectively, the "OLD PLANS"), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any such employee,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions, limitations and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependent (to the
extent such exclusions, limitations and actively-at-work requirements were
waived or satisfied as of the Effective Time under the corresponding Old Plan)
and (iii) all deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under any Old Plan
during the portion of the plan year of such Old Plan ending on the date such
employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins shall be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

          (c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue the employment of any
specific person.

          (d) The Company may provide up to the Retention Amount as a retention
pool (the "RETENTION POOL") for the purposes of retaining the services of
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES") who
are key employees. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall determine in
his sole discretion, subject to approval by (i) the Company Board (or the
Compensation Committee thereof) and (ii) Parent (whose approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), the Company Employees eligible to receive retention
awards from the Retention Pool (who shall not include Primary Company
Executives) (each, a "RETENTION BONUS"), the amounts of the Retention Bonus,
individually and in the aggregate, and any criteria for payment of the Retention
Bonus. Any Retention Bonus shall be intended to retain the services of the
recipient through, and shall be payable (if such recipient still remains
employed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries at such time) as soon as
practicable following (but in no event more than 30 days following) the first to
occur of (x) the 90th day following the Closing Date or (y) if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof, the date of such termination (such
first to occur, the "VESTING DATE"); provided that such Retention Bonus shall be
payable in the event that the applicable recipient's employment has been
terminated (i) prior to the Closing Date without cause by mutual agreement of
Parent and the Company, (ii) following the Closing Date but prior to the date of

<PAGE>
                                       47

payment of Retention Bonuses without cause (or by the applicable recipient in a
termination otherwise entitling such recipient to severance), or (iii) due to
death or long-term disability. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01(a), (b) or (f) hereof, Parent shall be solely
responsible for making payments of Retention Bonuses, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its affiliates in connection with such bonuses.
For purposes of this Agreement, the Retention Amount shall equal the product of
(x) $15,000,000 times (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days from the date hereof through the earlier of the Vesting Date and the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days from the date
hereof through December 31, 2006.

          (e) In the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to payment of
annual bonuses for the 2005 calendar year, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue to maintain and honor the Company's 2005 annual bonus
plans set forth in Section 6.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "2005
BONUS PLANS") for the 2005 calendar year and to pay Company Employees the bonus
amounts due under such 2005 Bonus Plans pursuant to the objective formulae set
forth therein (including formulae approved thereunder by the Company or the
Company Board, or a committee thereof, prior to August 10, 2005 and previously
provided to Parent), based on the performance of the Company and its operating
units, without adjusting such total for individual performance. If the Effective
Date has not occurred prior to or on December 31, 2005, the Company may
establish annual bonus plans ("2006 BONUS PLANS") for the 2006 calendar year on
terms consistent with past practice. If the Effective Date occurs during the
2006 calendar year, (x) Parent will pay, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, prorated bonuses (prorated to the Effective Time) to Company
Employees who were employed as of the Effective Time, assuming for purposes of
such prorated bonuses that all performance measures relevant to the
determination of bonuses under such 2006 Bonus Plans shall be deemed to have
been met for the period beginning on January 1, 2006 and ending on the Closing
Date, and (y) Parent shall implement a bonus plan for purposes of bonuses for
Company Employees for the balance of the 2006 calendar year. Company performance
in respect of calculations to be made under the 2005 Bonus Plans and 2006 Bonus
Plans shall be calculated without taking into account any expenses or costs
related to or arising out of the Transactions or any non-recurring charges that
would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the Transactions not
occurred.

          (f) From the Effective Time through December 31, 2006, (i) Company
Employees below the level of Director shall continue to participate in the
Maytag Corporation Separation Pay and Benefits Plan (the "SEVERANCE PLAN"), (ii)
Company Employees at the levels of Director and above shall be eligible for
severance benefits pursuant to the plan set forth in Section 6.05(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and (iii) none of the Severance Plan, the Maytag
Corporation Separation of Employment Plan or the plan set forth in Section
6.05(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be amended in any manner adverse
to the Company Employees.

     SECTION 6.06 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the Company's
obligations to indemnify the current or former directors or officers of the
Company for acts or omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to
the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on
the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the

<PAGE>
                                       48

Company By-laws or individual indemnity agreements, and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company By-laws and such individual
indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions. Parent shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to advance
funds for expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding relating to the indemnification obligations
referenced in the immediately preceding sentence in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by
or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall be
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to the indemnification
referenced in the immediately preceding sentence.

          (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies purchased by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, at the sole election of Parent, with reputable and financially
sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from
or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such
premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (such 300% amount, the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"). If such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to Parent
that the Maximum Premium is $3,696,000.

     SECTION 6.07 FEES AND EXPENSES. (a) Except as provided in this Section
6.07, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, except for (i) expenses incurred in connection
with printing, mailing and filing the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement and (ii)
all fees paid in respect of filings made by the Company and Parent pursuant to
the HSR Act in connection with the Merger, with the expenses and fees referred
to in clauses (i) and (ii) to be borne by Parent.

           (b)  The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $60,000,000 and shall
reimburse Parent for its payment to the Company of $40,000,000 in connection
with the Company's termination of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of May 19, 2005, by and among Triton Acquisition Holding Co.
("TRITON"), Triton Acquisition Co. and the Company (the "TRITON AGREEMENT")
if: (i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d);
(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, any person makes a Company Takeover
Proposal or amends a Company Takeover Proposal made prior to the date of this
Agreement, (B) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (and prior to such termination the Company
shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement) or 8.01(b)(iii) (but only if a Company Takeover
Proposal is publicly announced

<PAGE>
                                       49

at or prior to the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (C) within 12 months after the date of such
termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or
consummates, the transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal; or
(iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e). The
Company shall (i) pay to Parent a fee of $60,000,000 if Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) by reason of the Company knowingly
breaching its obligations under Section 5.02 (unless such breach of Section 5.02
has only an immaterial effect on Parent) and (ii) in such event, if the
circumstance described in clause (ii) (C) of the immediately preceding sentence
occurs, also reimburse Parent for its payment to the Company of $40,000,000 in
connection with the Company's termination of the Triton Agreement. Any amounts
due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds
on the date of termination of this Agreement (except that in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (ii) of either of the first or second sentence of
this Section 6.07(b), such payment shall be made on the date of execution of
such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such transactions and
in the case of termination pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such
payment shall be made on or before the fifth business day following such
termination). Solely for the purposes of clause (ii) of each of the first and
second sentences of this Section 6.07(b), the term "COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02(f), except that all
references to "20%" shall be changed to "40%". The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 6.07(b) are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 6.07(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(b), the Company shall pay to Parent
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(b) from and including the
date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment
at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made, together with reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred
in connection with such suit. It is expressly understood that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the $60,000,000 fee or reimburse the $40,000,000
payment referred to in this Section 6.07(b) on more than one occasion.

          (c) In the event that either the Company or Parent is entitled to
terminate, and terminates, this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or
8.01(b)(ii)(A) and at the time of such termination (i) all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.02(a), 7.02(b) and 7.02(c) have been satisfied or waived
(other than the delivery of certificates and provided that the term "Closing
Date" shall in any of such sections be deemed to refer to the date of such
termination), (ii) neither the Company nor Parent is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii)(B) and (iii) if a vote to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval has been taken at a Company Stockholder Meeting,
Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, then Parent shall pay a
termination fee equal to $120,000,000 (the "NONCLEARANCE TERMINATION FEE") on or
before the fifth business day following such termination by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated in writing to Parent by the Company at
least two business days after such termination.

     SECTION 6.08 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Each of Parent and Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult with each

<PAGE>
                                       50

other before issuing, and, to the extent reasonably feasible, provide each other
the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

     SECTION 6.09 TRANSFER TAXES. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("TRANSFER TAXES") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Sub and Parent in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes,
including supplying in a timely manner a complete list of all real property
interests held by the Company that are located in New York State and any
information with respect to such property that is reasonably necessary to
complete such Tax Returns.

     SECTION 6.10 RIGHTS AGREEMENTS; CONSEQUENCES IF RIGHTS TRIGGERED.

           (a)  The Company Board shall take all further actions (in addition
to those referred to in Section 3.05(c)) requested in writing by Parent in
order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other
Transactions. Except as approved in writing by Parent, the Company Board
shall not (i) amend the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) redeem the Company
Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make any determination
under, the Company Rights Agreement. If any Distribution Date or Share
Acquisition Date occurs under the Company Rights Agreement at any time during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent shall make such adjustment to the Merger Consideration as the
Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic
benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on the date of
this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions.

          (b) The Parent Board shall take all further actions (in addition to
those referred to in Section 4.05(c)) requested in writing by the Company in
order to render the Parent Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other
Transactions. Except as would not adversely affect the ability of Parent to
consummate the Merger and the Transactions, unless approved in writing by the
Company, the Parent Board shall not (i) amend the Parent Rights Agreement, (ii)
redeem the Parent Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Parent Rights Agreement.

     SECTION 6.11 STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and its directors relating to any Transaction;
provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     SECTION 6.12 STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger

<PAGE>
                                       51

and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise
of Company Stock Options to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance.

     SECTION 6.13 AFFILIATES.

          (a) Not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company (i) shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who, in
the Company's opinion, may be, as of the Effective Time, its "AFFILIATES" for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and (ii) shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each Person who is identified as an "AFFILIATE" of it in
such letter to deliver to Parent, as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, a signed agreement
reasonably acceptable to both Parent and the Company (an "AFFILIATE AGREEMENT").
The Company shall notify Parent from time to time after the delivery of the
letter described above of any Person not identified on such letter who then is,
or may be, such an "AFFILIATE" and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each
additional Person who is identified as an "AFFILIATE" to execute an Affiliate
Agreement.

          (b) Neither Parent or the Company shall register, or allow its
transfer agent to register, on its books, any transfer of any shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock of any affiliate of the Company who has not
provided an executed Affiliate Agreement in accordance with this Section 6.13
unless the transfer is made in compliance with the foregoing.

          (c) For one year following the Closing, Parent shall continue to make
available such adequate current public information as shall satisfy the
conditions set forth in Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act.

     SECTION 6.14 OTHER ACTIONS BY PARENT. Parent shall not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates not to, take any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the Merger set forth
in Article VII not being satisfied, except any action permitted to be taken
pursuant to Section 8.01.

     SECTION 6.15 SECTION 16(B). Parent shall take all such steps as may be
reasonably necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement by each individual who (a) is a director or
officer of the Company or (b) at the Effective Time will become a director or
officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

          (b) ANTITRUST. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall
have expired. Any Consents and filings required prior to the Closing under any
Antitrust Law, the absence of which would reasonably be expected to (i) have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
(iii) result in a criminal violation, shall have been obtained or made.

          (c) NO INJUNCTIONS OR RESTRAINTS. No restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation
of the Merger shall be in effect; provided, however, that prior to asserting
this condition, subject to Section 6.03, the asserting party shall have used its
reasonable best efforts or best efforts, as applicable, in a manner consistent
with this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 6.03(b), to prevent
the entry of any such injunction or other order and to appeal as promptly as
possible any such judgment that may be entered.

of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger are further subject to the following

          (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to Company
Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct, and those not so qualified

(other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.02, 3.03,
3.04 and 3.18, which shall be true and correct in all material respects), as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on the

relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties
qualified as to Company Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct, and
those not so qualified shall be true and correct except for such failures to be
true and correct as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.18, which shall be true and correct in all
material respects), on and as of such earlier date). Parent shall have received
a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of the Company to such effect.

          (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The Company shall have

officer of the Company to such effect.

          (c) ABSENCE OF COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. Except as disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Letter or in any Filed Company SEC Document, since the

     SECTION 7.03 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY. The obligation of the
Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the following conditions:

          (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties
of Parent and Sub set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to Parent

except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties qualified as to
Parent Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct, and those not so

Effect (other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.02
and 4.04, which shall be true and correct in all material respects), on and as
of such earlier date). The Company shall have received a certificate signed on

               December 31, 2006 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"), unless the failure to
               consummate the Merger is the result of a willful and material
               breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this
               Agreement;

                              (ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an order,

               non-appealable; or

                              (iii)if, upon a vote thereon at the Company
               Stockholder Meeting, the Company Stockholder Approval is not
               obtained;

          (c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained

failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b), and (ii) cannot
be or has not been cured by the Outside Date (provided that neither Parent nor
Sub is then in willful and material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement);

          (d) by Parent:

                              (i) if the Company Board or any committee thereof
               withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or
               publicly proposes to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to

          (e) by the Company prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval in accordance with Section 8.05(b); provided, however, that the Company
shall have complied with all provisions thereof, including the notice provisions
therein; or

          (f) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform in
any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b), and
(ii) cannot be or has not been cured by the Outside Date (provided that the
Company is not then in willful and material breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).

<PAGE>
                                       55

Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension
or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the stockholders of
the Company. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

      SECTION 8.05   PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION.  (a) A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 shall, in order to be effective, require
in the case of Parent, Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors

of Directors. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall
not require the approval of the stockholders of the Company.

8.01(e) only if (i) the Company Board has received a Superior Company
Proposal, (ii) in light of such Superior Company Proposal a majority of the
disinterested directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to withdraw or
modify its recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's exercise of its fiduciary duty under
applicable Law, (iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing of the
determinations described in clause (ii) above, (iv) at least five business
days following receipt by Parent of the notice referred to in clause
(iii) above, and taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent since
receipt of the notice referred to in clause (iii) above, such Superior
Company Proposal remains a Superior Company Proposal and a majority of the
disinterested directors of the Company has again made the determinations
referred to in clause (ii) above, (v) the Company is in compliance, in all
material respects, with Section 5.02, (vi) the Company has previously paid
the fee and reimbursement, as applicable, due under Section 6.07, (vii) the
Company Board concurrently approves, and the Company concurrently enters
into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such
Superior Company Proposal and (viii) Parent is not at such time entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c) (assuming for purposes
of this clause (viii) that the Outside Date is the date of termination of
this Agreement by the Company, except where the applicable breach or failure
to perform is not willful and material and is capable of being cured prior to
the Outside Date).

defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any Transaction in any court other than any New York state
