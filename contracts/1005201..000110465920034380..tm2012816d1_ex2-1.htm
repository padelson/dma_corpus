Assertio, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Parent, Assertio, Merger Sub or the Company:

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 3.3(f), each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon be converted into
and become exchangeable for 2.5 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section
3.3(f), in each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 3.3,
without interest.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding. Immediately following the Effective Time, shares of
Parent Common Stock, if any, owned by the Surviving Corporation shall be
surrendered to Parent without payment therefor.

  



  

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(e) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
appropriate effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split,
stock dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Assertio Common
Stock, Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to the Assertio Common Stock, Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock having a record date occurring on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section
3.1(e) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards and
Warrants_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option (each, a "
_Company Option_ ") to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under
the Amended and Restated 2019 Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan (amended
and restated effective as March 4, 2020) (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (a "
_Parent Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting
or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any
acceleration thereof provided for in the relevant Company Equity Plan or in
the related award document by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby)
as were applicable to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
such Parent Option shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if
necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent
Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to the corresponding Company Option divided by
(B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that in the case of any Company Option
to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time (taking into
account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the
exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code; _provided_ _further_ , that in the case of any Company Option to
which Section 409A of the Code applies as of the Effective Time, the exercise
price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and
the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code in order
to avoid the imposition of any additional taxes thereunder.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding time-based restricted
stock unit (each a " _Company Restricted Stock Unit_ ") granted under the
Company Equity Plan, whether or not then vested, shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, Parent shall deliver to each former holder of any such
cancelled Company Restricted Stock Unit a number of shares of fully vested
Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to the
product of (i) the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Company Restricted Stock Unit, subject to
reduction for any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.4.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance-based
restricted stock unit (each a " _Company Performance Stock Unit_ ") granted
under the Company Equity Plan shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
Parent shall deliver to each former holder of each award of Company
Performance Stock Units a number of shares of fully vested Parent Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to the product of (i) the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
covered by such Company Performance Stock Unit, subject to reduction for any
Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 3.4.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(d) At the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of
each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock described in Section
4.2(a)(v) of this Agreement (each a " _Company Warrant_ ") that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise elected
by the holder of any such Company Warrant, Parent shall issue a replacement
warrant (a " _Replacement Warrant_ ") that complies with and satisfies the
applicable terms and conditions of the applicable warrant agreement
between the Company and the holder of the Company Warrant (including as to
limitations of beneficial ownership under the warrant agreement) providing
that such Replacement Warrant shall be exercisable for a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole
number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would have
been issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrant and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, at an exercise price of $0.0004 per share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary for the adjustment of the Company Options and acceleration
and vesting of the Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance
Stock Units under this Section 3.2. The Company shall ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, no holder of a Company Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit
or Company Performance Stock Unit (or former holder of any such equity
awards) or a participant in the Company Equity Plan shall have any rights
thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or any
other equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights).

  



  

(f) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that will be subject to Parent Options and will be issued to former
holders of Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Stock Units
as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 3.2. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available,
other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the Parent Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as the Parent Options remain outstanding and
are required to be registered.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent
(the  " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
holders to the extent they hold Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares), book-
entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1(a). In addition, Parent
shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f). All certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends, distributions and
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 3.3(f), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and
contain such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section
3.3(f). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent
may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate (other than Excluded Shares or
Dissenting Shares) (A) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by
such holder under all Certificates so surrendered) to which such holder of
Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested), (B) any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and (C) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and send to
each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by
book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than with respect to Excluded
Shares or Dissenting Shares, (1) that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder of Book-Entry Shares shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(a) (which shall be in book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested), (2) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and (3) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f),
without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any unpaid
dividends and distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f).

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that
such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such tax is not applicable.

  



  

(d) (i) No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to
receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 3.3(f), in each case until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article III. Following the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Article III, there shall be paid to the
record holder thereof, without interest, (A) promptly after such surrender,
the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.3(f) and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
holders of Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock under this Article III shall be paid (A) at the time of payment
of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section 3.3(b), the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
3.3(f) and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
the time of such payment by the Exchange Agent under Section 3.3(b) and a
payment date subsequent to the time of such payment by the Exchange Agent
under Section 3.3(b) payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

  



  

(e) The Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f) issued and paid upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or transfer is
sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, no dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the
Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive (taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder and rounded
to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) pursuant to Section
3.1(a) by (ii) the volume weighted average price as of the close of trading
of each share of Assertio Common Stock traded on Nasdaq for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days ending at the close of business ending on the third
(3rd) trading day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (except to the
extent representing Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for
payment of the Merger Consideration, any unpaid dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f)
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), without
interest.

  



  

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of
Parent Common Stock, dividends or other distributions with respect thereto or
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
exchanged prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which the related Merger Consideration (and all
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Article III) would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration (and such
dividends, distributions and cash) in respect thereof shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
3.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 3.3(f).

  



  

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall each be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent determines it is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent shall reduce the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to each recipient under Section 3.2 by the number of shares of
Parent common Stock having a fair market value on the Closing Date equal to
the amount of taxes required to be withheld with respect to the issuance of
such shares to the recipient (as determined by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, or Exchange Agent). For this purpose "fair market
value" shall mean the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq
on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each share of the Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such shares of the Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.
If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
loses such holder's right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a), without interest.
The Company shall give Assertio (a) prompt notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of the Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, attempted written
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights to
appraisal with respect to the Merger and (b) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise of such appraisal
rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Assertio, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for payment of fair value for capital stock of the Company, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

subsection of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Assertio
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any information
in a particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosure of such information with respect to any other section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such information is
readily apparent on its face), the Company represents and warrants to Parent,
Assertio and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

  



  

(a) The Company (i) is an entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States) in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in the case of clause (iii), where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse
Effect_ " means (x) any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or
state of facts that (A) is or would reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the business, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise), or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) materially impairs the ability of
the Company to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
clause (A) only, Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include any event,
change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts to the extent
resulting from (1) changes or conditions generally affecting the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, or the economy or the
financial, debt, banking, capital, credit or securities markets, in the United
States, including effects on such industries, economy or markets resulting
from any regulatory and political conditions or developments in general, (2)
the outbreak or escalation of war or acts of terrorism or any natural
disasters, acts of God or comparable events, epidemic, pandemic or disease
outbreak (including the COVID-19 virus), (3) changes in applicable Law or
GAAP, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof after the date of this
Agreement, (4) the public announcement of this Agreement or the pendency
of this Agreement, (5) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company to meet
any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates, or predictions
in respect of revenues, earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for
any period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to
or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected
to become, a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the extent permitted by this
definition and not otherwise excepted by a clause of this proviso); (6) any
change, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of the
Company's securities or in its credit ratings (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such change may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or would reasonably be expected to become, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, to the extent permitted by this definition and not otherwise excepted
by a clause of this proviso); or (7) any specific action taken (or omitted to
be taken) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or with the express
written direction or written consent of Parent or Assertio;  _provided_ ,
that, with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (3), the impact of such event,
change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts is not
disproportionately adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

Incorporation and Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of
its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and
each as so delivered is in full force and effect. The Company is not in
violation of any provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws. Except
with respect to the extent relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in draft form and except as may be redacted to preserve an
privilege (including attorney-client privilege), the Company has made
available to Assertio true and complete copies of the minutes of all meetings
of the Company's stockholders, the Company Board and each committee of the
Company Board held since January 1, 2018 through the date of this Agreement.

Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities
or to issue, grant, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, granted,

there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
of which the Company has knowledge with respect to the holding, voting,
registration, redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the
transfer of, any capital stock or other voting securities or equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted

requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, including, in
each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Company SEC Documents at the time they were filed (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing) contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

misleading.

  



  

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and
schedules thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC
Documents (i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in

Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the Company's periodic and current
reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to the Company's chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer by others within those
entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as required
under the Exchange Act. The chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the company have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form
10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain
a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial
reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and

financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting. A true, correct and complete

and audit committee is set forth as Section 4.6(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or

Documents.

filed with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at
the time it (or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

make the statements therein not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will
not, at the time it is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, at the

Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all

Section 4.10 _Litigation_.  There is no legal, administrative, arbitral,
or other proceeding, suit, action, investigation, arbitration, examination,

expected to cause the loss of the sponsor's ability to rely upon such letter,
and nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in the
loss of the qualified status of such Company Plan;

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(iv) there is no Action (including any investigation, audit or
other administrative proceeding) by the Department of Labor, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ "), the IRS or any other
Governmental Entity or by any plan participant or beneficiary pending, or to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, relating to the Company Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Plans or the
assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Plans (other than routine

respect to a contractual obligation to reimburse any premiums such person may
pay in order to obtain health coverage under COBRA;

  



  

(viii) each Company Plan is subject exclusively to United States
Law; and

  



  

(ix) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger will not, either alone or in combination with any
other event, (A) entitle any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other similar termination payment, or (B) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of or otherwise enhance
any benefit due any such employee, officer, director or consultant.

of the Code has been operated and maintained since January 1, 2005 in
compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and the

885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3, 2004, based upon a good faith
reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the 409A Authorities and has not

up, make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax (including Taxes imposed under Section
409A of the Code) or interest or penalty related thereto.

  



  

(f) Each Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of
each other Company Option is no less than the fair market value of a share of

charges or complaints against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending
before the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority, (ii) representation claims or petitions or demands for

with applicable overtime laws, and no person treated as an independent
contractor or consultant by the Company or any Subsidiary should have been
properly classified as an employee under applicable law.

Disclosure Letter, there are no Actions against the Company or any of its

former employee, officer, consultant or other service provider of the Company,
including, without limitation, any claim relating to employment
discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay, employment classification

licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii), where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an
Assertio Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Assertio

occurrence, effect or state of facts that (A) is or would reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the
business, assets, condition (financial or otherwise), or results of
operations of the Parent, Assertio, Merger Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) materially impairs the ability of
Parent, Assertio or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of clause (A) only, Assertio Material Adverse Effect shall not
include any event, change, circumstance, occurrence, effect or state of facts
to the extent resulting from (1) changes or conditions generally affecting
the industries in which Assertio and its Subsidiaries operate, or the economy
or the financial, debt, banking, capital, credit or securities markets, in
the United States, including effects on such industries, economy or markets
resulting from any regulatory and political conditions or developments in
general, (2) the outbreak or escalation of war or acts of terrorism or any

of this Agreement, (5) any failure, in and of itself, by Assertio to meet any
internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates, or predictions in
respect of revenues, earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for
any period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to
or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected
to become, an Assertio Material Adverse Effect, to the extent permitted by
this definition and not otherwise excepted by a clause of this proviso); (6)
any change, in and of itself, in the market price or trading volume of
Assertio's or Parent's securities or in its credit ratings (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to
such change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to become,
an Assertio Material Adverse Effect, to the extent permitted by this
definition and not otherwise excepted by a clause of this proviso); or (7)
any specific action taken (or omitted to be taken) by Parent, Assertio, Merger
Sub and their respective Subsidiaries at or with the express written
direction or written consent of the Company; _provided_ , that, with respect
to clauses (1), (2) and (3), the impact of such event, change, circumstance,
occurrence, effect or state of facts is not disproportionately adverse to
Parent, Assertio, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to other participants in the industries in which Assertio
and its Subsidiaries operate.

Section 5.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Assertio has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely
basis true and complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed with or furnished to the
SEC by Assertio since January 1, 2018 (all such documents, together with all
exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the  "Assertio _SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the
Assertio SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and none of the Assertio SEC Documents at the time
they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or
superseding filing) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and
schedules thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the
Assertio SEC Documents (i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the
books and records of Assertio and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (iii)
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto and (iv) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their respective consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not, or are not expected
to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since January 1, 2018, Assertio
has not made any change in the accounting practices or policies applied in
the preparation of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC
rule or policy or applicable Law. The books and records of Assertio and its
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable) and any other applicable

(c) Assertio has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information relating to Assertio, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in Assertio's periodic and current reports under the
Exchange Act, is made known to Assertio's chief executive officer and its
chief financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act.
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Assertio have
evaluated the effectiveness of Assertio's disclosure controls and procedures
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable
Assertio SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any
amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation.

  



  

(d) Assertio and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
Assertio's financial reporting and the preparation of Assertio's financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Assertio has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of Assertio's internal control
over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to Assertio's auditors and
audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of Assertio's internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Assertio's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Assertio's internal control over financial
reporting. A true, correct and complete summary of any such disclosures made
by management to Assertio's auditors and audit committee is set forth as
Section 5.5(d) of the Assertio Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(e) Since January 1, 2018, (i) neither Assertio nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Assertio or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney
representing Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Assertio Board or any committee thereof
or to any director or officer of Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries.

the Assertio SEC Documents is subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC
comment or investigation.

  



  

(g) Neither Assertio nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Assertio and any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements"
(as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S K under the Exchange Act)), where
the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
Assertio or any of its Subsidiaries in Assertio's or such Subsidiary's
published financial statements or other Assertio SEC Documents.

the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the rules and regulations
of Nasdaq, in each case, that are applicable to Assertio.

report, schedule, statement or other document with the SEC.

  



  

Section 5.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Assertio nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, whether due or
to become due and whether or not required to be recorded or reflected on a
balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent specifically accrued or
reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet of Assertio and its
Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2019 included in the Annual Report on Form
10-K filed by Assertio with the SEC on March 10, 2020 (without giving effect
to any amendment thereto filed on or after the date hereof), (b) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2019 that are not material
to Assertio and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (c) are incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (d) which
are not, in the aggregate, material to Assertio and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Certain Information_. The Joint Proxy Statement will not at
the time it is first mailed to Assertio's stockholders, at the time of any
amendments or supplements thereto and at the time of the Assertio Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Form S-4 will not, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with
the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at the time it
(or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Assertio or
Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the
Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

practice; (b) there has not been any change, event or development or
prospective change, event or development that, individually or in the

Section 6.2 _Company Non-Solicitation; Company Recommendation
of the Merger_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any
of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse,
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect
to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any third Person any
information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) agree in writing or publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions and negotiations with any third Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such third Person and (B) request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (1)
the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was
unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
6.2, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and
(4) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause
(x) or (y) below would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing terms
no less restrictive in any material respect to the Company than, those set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and in accordance with procedures consistent in
all material respects with the Company's practices in providing for the
disclosures of such information to Assertio; _provided_ , that (I) the Company
shall provide Assertio a non-redacted copy of each confidentiality agreement
the Company has executed in accordance with this Section 6.2(a) and (II) the
Company shall furnish or make available to Assertio prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is furnished or made available to such third
Person any non-public information that was not previously provided to Assertio
or its Representatives, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Assertio of any decision of
the Company Board to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning such
an Acquisition Proposal or to provide non-public information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall be given as promptly as reasonably practicable
after such determination was reached (and in any event no later than twenty-
four (24) hours after such determination was reached). For the avoidance of
doubt, it shall not be a violation of this _Section 6.2_ if the Company and
its Representatives contact a third Person making any Acquisition Proposal
solely to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and to
determine whether it constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

  



  

(i) make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change; or

  



  

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement,
joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), in each case constituting or related to, or which is intended
to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or agree in
writing or publicly propose to take any such actions.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to
do so would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may
be proposed by Assertio pursuant to this Section 6.2(b), make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (x) a Superior Proposal
or (y) an Intervening Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal, unless:

  



  

(A) the Company notifies Assertio in writing at least four (4)
Business Days before taking that action of its intention to do so (the "
_Notice Period_ "), and specifies the reasons therefor, including the terms
and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making, such Superior
Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any) of the proposed
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction
documents (it being understood and agreed that if there is any material
amendment to the financial terms (including any such material amendment (it
being understood that there may be multiple extensions)) or other terms of
such Superior Proposal after the commencement of the Notice Period, the Notice
Period shall be extended to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remain
in the Notice Period subsequent to the date the Company notifies Parent of
the material amendment); and

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(B) if Assertio makes a proposal during such Notice Period to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board,
after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this
Agreement as proposed by Assertio, continues to determine in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; _provided_ _further_ , that the Company Board may not
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event unless:

  



  

(1) the Company provides Assertio with written information
describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as
reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it;

  



  

(2) the Company keeps Assertio reasonably informed of developments
with respect to such Intervening Event;

  



  

(3) the Company notifies Assertio in writing at least four (4)
Business Days before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the
reasons therefor; and

  



  

(4) if Assertio makes a proposal during such four (4) Business Day
period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of
this Agreement as proposed by Assertio, continues to determine in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law.

  



  

During the Notice Period prior to its effecting a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Assertio in good faith (to
the extent Assertio seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Assertio.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms (including the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section

Section 6.4 _Preparation of Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders' Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement
(and in any event within twenty-one (21) calendar days after the
date hereof), Assertio and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement relating to (i) the special meeting of the
Company's stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held to
consider the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) the stockholders of Assertio
relating to the annual meeting of Assertio's stockholders (the " _Assertio
Stockholders Meeting_ "), which meeting shall include a proposal for the
requisite stockholder approval required by the rules of Nasdaq with respect
to the Parent Stock Issuance. In consultation with Assertio, the
Company shall set a preliminary record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act in connection therewith. In consultation with the Company,
Assertio shall set a preliminary record date for the Assertio Stockholders
Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act in connection therewith.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall prepare (with the Company's reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_"), in which the
Joint Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus, in connection with
the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Parent Stock Issuance. Each of the Company, Assertio and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing, (B) to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (C)
to ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act. Parent shall
also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent
to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Except with
respect to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by
Section 6.2(b), no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent, Assertio or the Company, as
applicable, without providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon and without the other's prior approval (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent or Assertio, on the
one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, as applicable, will advise the
other promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the time
when the Form S-4 has become effective or any amendment or supplement thereto
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information in connection therewith, and will promptly provide the
other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
responses thereto in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Assertio or Parent,
or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company, Assertio or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not contain any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders of the
Company or the stockholders of Assertio or Parent, as applicable; _provided_ ,
that the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or
supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to any party.

advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith (and such Company Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no

prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that the Company may
not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting more than a total of
two times pursuant to clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this Section.

proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Company to hold the Assertio
Stockholders Meeting on the same day and at the same time as the
Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting.
Assertio may postpone or adjourn the Assertio Stockholders Meeting solely (i)

not a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Assertio Board has determined in good faith

Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Assertio Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ , that Parent may not postpone or adjourn the Assertio
Stockholders Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant to clause
(ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this Section. Notwithstanding the

pursuant to this Section 6.4(d) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent, Assertio or
any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of
any Assertio Adverse Approval Change.

  



  

(e) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Assertio, as sole stockholder of Parent, shall approve this

Company's existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and _provided

benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee
benefits (excluding equity, equity-based and change in control benefits and

maintained for the benefit of any Continuing Employee (each, a " _Parent
Plan_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, credit each
Continuing Employee with all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(and their respective predecessors) for all purposes, including
without limitation, for purposes of eligibility and vesting but not for
benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals for vacation); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such service shall not be credited to the extent that it
would result in a duplication of benefits.

to (i) waive all pre-existing condition, actively at work, waiting period and
similar requirements that apply to any Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) to the extent that such requirement was satisfied by, or
did not apply to, such Continuing Employee under the corresponding Company
Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) honor all expenses paid
or incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under
the corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the plan year in which
such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent becomes eligible for coverage
under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 6.14 shall (i) be deemed to be the adoption of, or
an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term is defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, Company Plan or Assertio Plan (ii) limit the right of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, to amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plan, program

terms set forth in the term sheet attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (each, an "
_Intercompany Agreement_ ").

  



  

Section 6.17 _Tax Treatment_. Each of Parent, Assertio, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
either (i) each of the Assertio Reorganization and the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii)
such transactions taken together to qualify as a transaction governed by
Section 351 of the Code. Such efforts shall include exercising reasonable best
efforts to cause either the Assertio LLC Merger or the Company LLC Merger to
occur immediately after the Assertio Reorganization and the Merger in the
event that such LLC mergers are deemed necessary in order to preserve the
treatment referred to in the preceding sentence. None of Assertio,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall take any action, or
allow any affiliate to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to
preclude any of the foregoing.
