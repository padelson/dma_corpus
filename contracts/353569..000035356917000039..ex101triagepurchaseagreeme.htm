Assumption and Bill of Sale, except for: (a) the deletion of provisions which
are inapplicable to such Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities; (b) such
changes as may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable local
Law; and (c) such changes as may be reasonably agreed upon in writing by
Seller, Purchaser and Abbott (the "Foreign Acquisition Agreements"); provided,
in each case that the Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall serve purely to
effect and make enforceable vis-a-vis Third Parties the transfer of the legal
and beneficial interest in and to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities
and shall not have any significant effect on the value being received by any
Designated Purchaser or any Asset Seller Entity, including the allocation of
assets and Liabilities as between them, all of which shall be determined by
this Agreement.

SECTION 2.04. Non-Assignment; Consents.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey, deliver
or assume a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability to the extent that a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery or assumption thereof (i) would be
prohibited by Law or (ii) would, without the Consent by any relevant Third
Party, (A) constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or of any
Contract related to the Triage Business or (B) be ineffective, void or
voidable, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B) unless and until such
Consent is obtained.

(b) If the Closing occurs and (i) the circumstances described in Section
2.04(a) exist or (ii) any Consent of a Governmental Authority that is required
to permit a Designated Purchaser to place Products on the market in a
particular jurisdiction under a Registration included within the Purchased
Assets has not then been obtained and such jurisdiction is not a Deferred
Asset Jurisdiction (which are the subject of Section 2.08), until the earlier
of such time as such Consent is obtained and the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, (A) Seller and Purchaser shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any such Consent
required to: (x) sell, assign, transfer, convey or deliver (directly or
indirectly) any Purchased Asset to Purchaser or another Designated Purchaser,
and (y) obtain the unconditional release of the Asset Seller Entities and
their respective Affiliates so that Purchaser or another Designated Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for the Assumed Liabilities; provided, that (1)
nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or in any way require the Asset
Seller Entities, Abbott or any of their respective Affiliates to expend money,
commence any Action or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any Third Party in connection with obtaining any Consent to
transfer any Purchased Asset and (2) costs to obtain subscriptions, software
as a service or software or information technology licenses shall not be
deemed a cost to obtain Consent, and Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
the cost of any such subscriptions, software as a service or software or
information technology licenses for the operation of the Triage Business or
ownership of the Purchased Assets following Closing, including those included
within, or related to Information Technology Assets included within, the
Purchased Assets under Section 2.01(a)(xviii), and (B) pending such Consent
and continuing until the earlier of (1) the receipt of such Consent and (2)
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser will put in
place any lawful arrangement, the content of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Abbott (with any appropriate "firewalls" or
similar procedures required under applicable Competition Laws), intended to
provide Purchaser, to the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and
benefits of any such Purchased Asset and the 



burdens and costs of any such Assumed Liability (including by means of any
agency, contract manufacturing, distribution, supply, subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing arrangement). Seller shall pay to Purchaser
promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received
by Seller or its Affiliates with respect to any such Purchased Assets (net of
any Assumed Liabilities, Taxes or any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs
imposed upon or incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the arrangements contemplated by this Section 2.04(b)). Once a required
Consent for the sale, assignment, conveyance, assumption, transfer and
delivery of a Purchased Asset is obtained, Seller will promptly transfer such
Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability to Purchaser or another Designated
Purchaser at no additional cost to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.04(a) and 2.04(b), any Shared
Contract to be assigned, transferred or conveyed in accordance with Section
2.01(a) shall, to the extent commercially reasonable, be separated as of the
Closing, so that each of Purchaser and Seller or their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to the rights and benefits and shall assume the related
portion of any Liabilities inuring to their respective businesses (with
respect to Purchaser, from and after the Closing). The Parties shall cooperate
with each other to effect such separation. The costs to effect such separation
shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser; provided that (A) Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for the costs of any subscriptions, software as a
service or software or information technology licenses for the operation of
the Triage Business or ownership of the Purchased Assets following Closing,
and (B) Seller shall be solely responsible for the costs of any subscriptions,
software as a service or software or information technology licenses not
related to the operation of the Triage Business or ownership of the Purchased
Assets following Closing. If any Shared Contract cannot be so separated,
Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause, for the
period after the Closing and for the duration of the then-current term after
the Closing (i) the rights and benefits under each Shared Contract to the
extent relating to the Triage Business to be enjoyed by the applicable
Designated Purchaser, (ii) the Liabilities under each Shared Contract to the
extent constituting an Assumed Liability and relating to the Triage Business
to be borne by the applicable Designated Purchaser, (iii) the rights and
benefits under each Shared Contract to the extent related to the Excluded
Businesses to be enjoyed by the applicable Asset Seller Entity, and (iv) the
Liabilities under each Shared Contract to the extent constituting an Excluded
Liability or related to the Excluded Businesses to be borne by the applicable
Asset Seller Entity. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce, at the request (and for the benefit and burden) of Purchaser, any
rights of any Asset Seller Entity, as applicable, arising from the portion of
any Shared Contract that is not assigned or transferred to the applicable
Designated Purchaser to the extent such rights are related to the Triage
Business.

SECTION 2.05. Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and the other
Designated Purchasers, shall (a) pay to Seller, on behalf of the Asset Seller
Entities, an aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets in an amount in
cash equal to $400,000,000 (the "Initial Purchase Price") and (b) assume the
Assumed Liabilities (together with the Initial Purchase Price, the "Purchase
Price"). The Initial Purchase Price shall be paid in Dollars at the Closing by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts
designated in writing by Seller no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any
portion of the Initial Purchase Price is required under applicable Law to be
paid in a Foreign Currency or to a specific Asset Seller Entity, the
applicable Dollar amount (as allocated pursuant to Section 2.06) shall be
converted into the applicable Foreign Currency at the Exchange Rate in effect
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing and paid by Purchaser or another
Designated Purchaser to the applicable Asset Seller Entity by wire transfer to
one (1) or more bank accounts designated at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date in 



writing by Seller in lieu of the payment of such portion of the Initial
Purchase Price in Dollars pursuant to this Section 2.05.

SECTION 2.06. Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price
by country based on an estimate of the fair market values of the Purchased
Assets and, if required by applicable Law, an allocation by asset category
within a particular country (together the "Estimated Allocation"). Subject to
Section 6.04(a), during the fifteen (15) day period following delivery of the
Estimated Allocation, Seller shall make its Representatives reasonably and
timely available to Purchaser, Abbott and their respective Representatives to
discuss the Estimated Allocation. The Estimated Allocation shall be prepared
in accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. If Purchaser does not deliver written
notice of any dispute (an "Allocation Dispute Notice") within fifteen (15)
days after receipt of the Estimated Allocation, the Estimated Allocation shall
be deemed the Final Allocation for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the end of
such fifteen (15) day period, Purchaser may accept the Estimated Allocation by
delivering written notice to that effect to Seller and Abbott, in which case
the Estimated Allocation shall be deemed the Final Allocation for all purposes
hereunder when such notice is given. If Purchaser delivers an Allocation
Dispute Notice within such fifteen (15) day period, the Parties and Abbott
shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such dispute during the thirty
(30) day period following Seller's receipt of the Allocation Dispute Notice
from Purchaser. If the Parties and Abbott do not agree upon a final resolution
with respect to the Estimated Allocation within such fifteen (15) day period,
then the Estimated Allocation shall be submitted immediately to an
internationally recognized, independent accounting or valuation firm
reasonably acceptable to the Parties and Abbott (the "Allocation Firm"). The
Allocation Firm shall be requested to render a determination of the applicable
dispute within fifteen (15) days after referral of the matter to such
Allocation Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The determination of the Allocation
Firm shall be final and binding, absent manifest error. Any fees payable to
the Allocation Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. The
Estimated Allocation accepted by the Parties and Abbott or determined by the
Allocation Firm, as the case may be, shall be the "Final Allocation". The
Final Allocation shall be done at arm's length based upon a good faith
determination of fair market value.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of Seller and
Purchaser and each of their respective Affiliates shall be bound by the Final
Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes related to the transfer of
the Purchased Assets. Seller and Purchaser shall prepare and file, and cause
their respective Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with the Final Allocation. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, none of Seller, Purchaser or their respective Affiliates shall take
any position inconsistent with the Final Allocation in any Tax Return, in any
Tax refund claim, in any Action or otherwise unless required by a final
determination by an applicable Governmental Authority. If any Party, or any
Affiliate of any Party, receives notice from any Governmental Authority that
such Governmental Authority is disputing the Final Allocation, such Party
shall promptly notify the other Party, and Seller and Purchaser agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to defend such Final Allocation in any Action.

SECTION 2.07. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a
closing (the "Closing") to be held at the offices of Baker and McKenzie LLP, 300
East Randolph Street, Suite 5000, Chicago, Illinois 60601, at 9:00 a.m.,
Chicago time, on the third (3rd) Business Day following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the Parties and Abbott set
forth in 



Article IX (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), or at such other place or at such other time or on such other
date as the Parties and Abbott may mutually agree upon in writing (the
"Closing Date"). Subject to Section 2.08, for the purposes of this Agreement,
the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred at 12:01 A.M. local time in each
applicable jurisdiction on the Closing Date.

SECTION 2.08. Deferred Asset Transfers.

(a) If (i) any Consent of a Governmental Authority required to (A) consummate
the sale of the Purchased Assets or assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in
any applicable jurisdiction, or (B) permit a Designated Purchaser to place
Products on the market in a particular jurisdiction under a Registration
included within the Purchased Assets has not been obtained at the time of the
Closing, (ii) despite the exercise by Purchaser of its reasonable best
efforts, the applicable Designated Purchaser (A) is not fully formed,
organized or incorporated, or (B) in any applicable jurisdiction has not
received the Governmental Authorizations or Registrations necessary for the
conduct of the Triage Business in such jurisdiction prior to the Closing Date
or (iii) any Governmental Authority in an applicable jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that has the effect of making the portion
of the Transactions contemplated in such jurisdiction illegal or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of such Transactions in such jurisdiction that is
continuing as of the Closing Date (each such jurisdiction, a "Deferred Asset
Jurisdiction"), then the Parties shall, in accordance with this Section
2.08(a) and Section 2.08(b), defer (to the extent permitted under applicable
Law) the consummation of the portion of the Transactions contemplated in such
Deferred Asset Jurisdiction solely with respect to the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities in respect of such Deferred Asset Jurisdiction (such items
for each Deferred Asset Jurisdiction, the "Deferred Assets and Liabilities");
provided, however, that the Parties shall have no obligation to consummate the
Transactions if any of the conditions set forth in Section 9.01, in the case
of Purchaser, or Section 9.02, in the case of Seller, shall not have been
satisfied or waived by such Party.

(b) From and after the Closing, and until such time as the applicable Deferred
Assets and Liabilities have been transferred to Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.08(c) (each, a "Deferred Transfer Closing"), such Deferred Assets and
Liabilities will be held for Purchaser's benefit and account and will be
managed and operated by the applicable Asset Seller Entity(ies) for the
benefit and account of the applicable Designated Purchaser, with all gains,
income, Losses, Taxes and Tax benefits or other items generated thereby to be
for the account of the applicable Designated Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser
will use their respective reasonable best efforts to allow the applicable
Designated Purchaser to receive the uninterrupted use and benefit of any
Deferred Assets and Liabilities from the Closing Date to the date of its
Deferred Transfer Closing. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section
2.08 or the other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, until the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing occurs, Seller
will conduct the Triage Business in such Deferred Asset Jurisdiction in
accordance with the reasonable and lawful instructions of Purchaser and its
Affiliates and, except to the extent resulting from or arising out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of or violation of Law by Seller or its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall defend and indemnify the Seller Indemnitees and
save and hold each of them harmless against any Losses incurred, sustained or
suffered by them arising out of or as a result of the performance by Seller
and its Affiliates of its and their respective obligations under this Section
2.08 in respect of any Deferred Assets and Liabilities from and after the
Closing until the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Section 2.08. 



(c) The Deferred Transfer Closing of any Deferred Assets and Liabilities shall
occur as promptly as is reasonably practicable after receipt of all applicable
required Consents, completion of the formation, organization or incorporation
of the applicable Designated Purchaser (and the receipt of necessary
Governmental Authorizations and Registrations), the resolution of all
applicable Judgments and the expiration of all mandatory waiting periods, or
at such time as the Parties may mutually agree upon in writing. For purposes
of Sections 2.01(a), 2.02, 2.04, 2.09(a), 2.10(b), 6.02, 6.04(a), 6.11, and
7.02(d), the instance of "Closing" in the last sentence of Section 1.03(a),
the instance of "Closing" in the second sentence of Section 2.07, and the
instances of "Closing" in the last two (2) sentences of Section 7.02(c), to
the extent applicable in connection with any Deferred Asset Jurisdiction, all
references to the Closing or the Closing Date shall be deemed to be references
to the applicable Deferred Transfer Closing and the date thereof.

SECTION 2.09. Closing Deliveries by Seller. At the Closing, Seller shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the applicable Designated Purchaser:

(a) executed counterparts of each Ancillary Agreement to which any Asset
Seller Entity is a party and such other instruments, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser or necessary under applicable Law to effect the transfer of the
Purchased Assets to the Designated Purchasers, in each case duly executed by
the Asset Seller Entities, as applicable; and

(b) the certificate required by Section 9.01(a).

SECTION 2.10. Closing Deliveries by Purchaser. At the Closing, Purchaser shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the applicable Asset Seller Entity:

(a) the Initial Purchase Price in the manner specified by Section 2.05;

(b) executed counterparts of each Ancillary Agreement to which any Designated
Purchaser is a party and such other instruments, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Seller or Abbott, as may be reasonably requested by
Seller or Abbott or necessary under applicable Law to effect the assumption by
the applicable Designated Purchasers of the Assumed Liabilities; and

(c) the certificate required by Section 9.02(a).

SECTION 2.11. Transferred Inventory Determination and Adjustment.

(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a good faith
calculation of the aggregate value of the Transferred Inventory, calculated as
of immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with the Accounting
Methodologies and in a manner consistent with the preparation of the
"Inventory, net" item set forth in the Reference Balance Sheet (the
"Transferred Inventory Calculation").

(b) After receipt of the Transferred Inventory Calculation, Seller shall have
sixty (60) days to review the Transferred Inventory Calculation, together with
the work papers used in the preparation thereof and the other written
documentation supporting the basis of Purchaser's determination of the
Transferred Inventory Calculation. During such sixty (60) day period,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, upon reasonable
advance notice, provide Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours and
without unreasonable interference with Purchaser and its 



Affiliates' operations to the books, records and employees engaged in
financial accounting and related functions for the Triage Business as may be
reasonably necessary for Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives to evaluate the Transferred Inventory Calculation and, if
applicable, prepare written notice of any dispute regarding the Transferred
Inventory Calculation (a "Dispute Notice"). If Seller does not deliver a
Dispute Notice to Purchaser within sixty (60) days after receipt of the
Transferred Inventory Calculation, the Transferred Inventory Calculation shall
be deemed the Final Transferred Inventory for all purposes hereunder. Prior to
the end of such sixty (60) day period, Seller may accept the Transferred
Inventory Calculation by delivering written notice to that effect to
Purchaser, in which case the Transferred Inventory Calculation shall be deemed
the Final Transferred Inventory for all purposes hereunder when such notice is
given. If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within such sixty (60)
day period, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve
such dispute during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the date
Purchaser receives the Dispute Notice from Seller. Any Dispute Notice
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) shall specify in reasonable detail
the nature and amount of any disagreements. If Seller and Purchaser do not
agree upon a final resolution with respect to any items included in the
Dispute Notice within such thirty (30) day period, then the remaining items in
dispute shall be submitted immediately to an internationally or nationally
recognized independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Seller and
Purchaser (the "Consultant"). Within thirty (30) days after the Consultant's
selection, the Consultant shall make a final determination in accordance with
the Accounting Methodologies and the terms and definitions of this Agreement
and based solely on the written submissions of the Parties of the appropriate
amount of each of the matters that remain in dispute, which determination
shall be final and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error; provided
that the Consultant shall under no circumstances be permitted to resolve any
disputes (i) with respect to any matter other than the matters indicated in
the Dispute Notice that remain in dispute or (ii) regarding the scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Consultant pursuant to this Section 2.11, which
such disputes shall in all cases be resolved in accordance with, and subject
to the limitations of, Section 12.06 and Section 12.08. Purchaser and Seller
shall make their respective financial records, to the extent related to the
calculation of the aggregate value of the Transferred Inventory, reasonably
available to the Consultant in connection with such determination. With
respect to each disputed matter, the determination by the Consultant pursuant
to this Section 2.11, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller
or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, or less than the lower, of
the amounts advocated by Seller in the Dispute Notice or by Purchaser in the
Transferred Inventory Calculation with respect to such disputed matter. The
dispute resolution under this Section 2.11 shall constitute an expert
determination under New York CPLR Article 76. Any fees payable to the
Consultant shall be borne equally by Seller on the one hand, and Purchaser on
the other hand. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving
any dispute hereunder before the Consultant shall be borne by the Party
incurring such cost or expense. Seller and Purchaser shall revise the
Transferred Inventory Calculation to reflect the resolution of any disputes
with respect thereto pursuant to this Section 2.11 and, as so revised, such
Transferred Inventory Calculation shall be deemed to set forth the final
aggregate value of the Transferred Inventory (the "Final Transferred
Inventory") for all purposes hereunder.

(c) If the Final Transferred Inventory is less than $28,000,000, then Seller
shall pay to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days after the determination
of the Final Transferred Inventory pursuant to Section 2.11(b) an amount equal
to the absolute value of such deficit by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in Dollars to an account designated in writing by Purchaser.
If the Final Transferred Inventory is greater than $31,000,000, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller within ten (10) Business Days after the determination of
the Final Transferred Inventory pursuant to Section 2.11(b) the amount of such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds in Dollars to an
account designated in writing by Seller.

Assets owned by Seller or the conduct of the Triage Business as currently

that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each Asset Seller Entity (other than Seller) is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under

change or occurrence that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably

mediation or action (an "Action") against Seller or any other Asset Seller
Entity, in each case, with respect to or relating to the Triage Business, or
(b) outstanding or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened order, judgment,
injunction, ruling, writ or decree of any Governmental Authority (a
"Judgment") imposed upon Seller or any Asset Seller Entity, in

be expected to be material to the Triage Business, Seller, each other Asset
Seller Entity and each of its and their directors, officers and employees and,

under applicable Law), in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,

expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to carry
out its obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and to
consummate the Transactions.

(b) Each Designated Purchaser (other than Purchaser) is an entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is

modification, or cancelation of any obligation or to the loss of any benefit
under any of the terms or provisions of any material Contract to which any

obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate
the Transactions.

SECTION 5.03. Governmental Approvals. Except for (a) compliance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (b)
compliance with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ and (c) the Consents and
other filings required under, and compliance with other applicable
requirements of, the Competition Laws set forth in Section 5.03(c) of the
Purchaser Disclosure Letter, no Consent of any Governmental Authority is
necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser and
the Ancillary Agreements by the Designated Purchasers that will be parties
thereto, the performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and by the
Designated Purchasers of their obligations thereunder, and the consummation by
each Designated Purchaser of the Transactions, other than such other Consents
that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
performance by any Designated Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

SECTION 5.04. Litigation. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
ability of any Designated Purchaser to carry out its obligations under this

there is no (a) pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened Action
against any Designated Purchaser, or (b) outstanding Judgment imposed upon any
Designated Purchaser. 



SECTION 5.05. Financing.

(a) Purchaser has received and accepted an executed commitment letter dated
July 15, 2017, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit H (the
"Commitment Letter"), from the debt financing sources named therein
(collectively, the "Lenders"), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the full amount of the
debt financing described therein (the "Financing"). Purchaser also has
delivered to Abbott an accurate and complete copy of the fee letters related
to the Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Fee Letters"), subject to
redaction of fee amounts and other customary commercial terms (relating to the
terms not affecting conditionality).

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce the
total amount of the Financing. There are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements (except, in the case of the Financing, for the Fee
Letters and customary engagement letters in respect of securities offerings
contemplated in lieu of the Financing) relating to the funding or investing,
as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing.

(c) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, will
provide Purchaser with cash proceeds on the Closing Date in an amount
sufficient, along with other sources provided by Purchaser, to consummate the
Transactions on the terms contemplated hereby, including the payment of the
Purchase Price, and to pay related fees and expenses. To the Knowledge of
Purchaser, there is no fact or occurrence as of the date of this Agreement
that would cause the conditions to funding of the Financing not to be
satisfied at or before the Closing, and Purchaser reasonably believes that it
will be able to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Closing
to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letter.

(d) The Commitment Letter is valid and binding on, and enforceable against,
Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each other party thereto, in
accordance with its terms, is in full force and effect, and no event has
occurred that, with or without notice or the lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (i) make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Commitment Letter or Fee Letters inaccurate to the
extent that they are conditions to the Financing, (ii) result in any of the
terms or conditions in the Commitment Letter or Fee Letters that are
conditions to the funding of the Financing not being satisfied, (iii) cause
the Commitment Letter or Fee Letters to be ineffective or (iv) otherwise
result in the Financing not being available on a timely basis in order to
consummate the Transactions. The Commitment Letter has not been amended,
restated or otherwise modified or waived on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other
fees or expenses required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letter on or before the date of this Agreement.

(e) In no event will the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
Purchaser or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 5.06. Solvency; Fraudulent Conveyance. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article IV, immediately
after giving effect to the Transactions, including receipt of the Financing,
Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including each other Designated
Purchaser) will be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and
will own property that has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts
required to pay their respective debts when due (including all contingent
Liabilities). 



Immediately after giving effect to the Transactions, including receipt of the
Financing, Purchaser and the other Designated Purchasers will have adequate
capital to carry on their respective businesses. No transfer of property is
being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including any other
Designated Purchaser).

SECTION 5.07. Brokers and Other Advisors. Except for Perella Weinberg
Partners, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Purchaser Parent, no
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to
any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission, or the reimbursement of expenses in connection therewith, in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of any Designated Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.08. Investigation. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has
made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
and the Triage Business and (b) has been furnished with or given access to
such information about the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the
Triage Business as it has requested. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the only representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made
by Abbott or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement and, except as set
forth in Article III, none of Abbott or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives makes any other representation or warranty of any kind or
nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, with respect to any
Asset Seller Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Triage Business, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (or the
Transactions), including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
relating to the financial condition, results of operations, assets or
Liabilities of any of the foregoing entities, (ii) the only representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made by Seller or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives are the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made in this Agreement or as may be set forth in the Ancillary
Agreements and, except as set forth in Article IV or as may be set forth in
the Ancillary Agreements, none of Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives makes any other representation or warranty of any kind or
nature whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, with respect to any
Asset Seller Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Triage Business, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (or the
Transactions), including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
relating to the financial condition, results of operations, assets or
Liabilities of any of the foregoing entities and (iii) none of the Asset
Seller Entities, Abbott or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives makes any representation or warranty as to (A) the operation
of the Triage Business by Purchaser after the Closing in any manner or (B) the
probable success or profitability of the Triage Business after the Closing.
Except for the representations and warranties of Abbott contained in Article
III and the representations and warranties of Seller in Article IV or as may
be set forth in the Ancillary Agreements, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates have relied upon any other representations or warranties or any
other information made or supplied by or on behalf of any Asset Seller Entity,
Abbott or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Asset Seller Entities, Abbott or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives has any Liability or
responsibility for any other representation, warranty, opinion, projection,
forecast, advice, statement or information made, communicated or furnished
(orally or in writing) to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives (including any opinion, projection, forecast, advice,
statement or information that may have been or may be provided to Purchaser by
any Affiliate or Representative of Purchaser). Purchaser acknowledges that,
should the Closing occur, Purchaser shall acquire the Purchased Assets and the
Triage Business without any representation or warranty as to merchantability
or fitness thereof for any particular purpose, in an "as is" 



condition and on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement. Purchaser hereby waives any and all rights under Section
1542 of the California Civil Code.

response to any queries made by them that are raised in connection with the
Merger Clearances or the Consents of Governmental Authorities under applicable
Competition Laws in connection with the Transactions, which may include
information regarding this Agreement, Purchaser's capabilities as the
potential purchaser of the Triage Business, or other matters), and (iii) to
promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all Consents under any such Competition Laws that may be
required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental
Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the
parties hereto to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser shall promptly take all actions necessary to secure the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period under any applicable
Competition Law and resolve any objections asserted with respect to the
Transactions under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other applicable
Law raised by any Governmental Authority, in order to prevent the entry of,
any restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation
of the Transactions. Purchaser shall respond to and seek to resolve as
promptly as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions and none of the Parties or Abbott
or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any action with the intention
to, or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the expiration or
termination of any waiting period or the obtaining of approval under any
applicable Competition Laws. Anything to contrary in this Section 6.02
notwithstanding, (A) neither Seller nor Abbott shall be required to expand in
any way the nature or scope of the Triage Business or Purchased Assets or to
include within the Triage Business any aspect of the Excluded Businesses or
otherwise include within the Purchased Assets any Excluded Assets, and (B)
none of Purchaser or its Affiliates shall be required (1) to commence or
defend through litigation any claim asserted in court or other administrative
tribunal by any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated any Judgment that would
prohibit, enjoin, or make illegal the consummation of the Transactions, or (2)
to enter into or agree to enter into any consent decree or hold separate order
or other arrangement that would require the divestiture, exclusive license
(including as to Purchaser and its Affiliates) or discontinuation, before or
after the Closing Date, of any assets or current businesses of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or any portion of the Triage Business or the Purchased
Assets.

(c) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law or Judgment,
Purchaser shall promptly disclose to Seller and Abbott, and provide copies to
Seller and Abbott of, all correspondence, filings or communications between
Purchaser or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement and the Transactions. To the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, Purchaser shall permit Seller and
Abbott to review in advance any proposed correspondence, filings or
communication by Purchaser to any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement; provided, however, that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation,
projections, strategy, business plans or prospects of Purchaser and its
Affiliates, the Purchased Assets or the Triage Business, (ii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns; provided, that
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to enter into such joint
defense agreements or other arrangements with Seller and Abbott, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of attorney-client or other privilege, and (iii) as
necessary to otherwise comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law;
provided further, that, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii), and (iii), if Purchaser provides redacted materials to Seller or Abbott,
it must also 



provide on an "outside counsel only" basis a copy of the same materials
without any redactions applied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein and subject to the provisions in the Merger Agreement, Abbott shall, on
behalf of the Parties, have control over and lead all communications and
strategy relating to obtaining all Consents and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or other Third Party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions or to conduct any litigation arising therefrom.
Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall agree to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including
any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry related to
the Transactions unless it, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives Abbott the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. Seller and Purchaser shall consult with Abbott's counsel with respect
to, or give Abbott's counsel the opportunity to attend, that portion of any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in which the valuation, projections,
business plans or prospects of Purchaser or its Affiliates, the Purchased
Assets or the Triage Business are discussed. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, Abbott and each Party shall coordinate and cooperate fully with
each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as
Abbott or such other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking Consents under the applicable Competition Laws.

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that the entry by Seller and Abbott into this
Agreement, the performance by Seller and Abbott of their respective
obligations hereunder and, if applicable, the consummation of the Transactions
are being undertaken by Seller and Abbott to obtain the Merger Clearances and
to consummate the Merger Transaction. Anything to the contrary in this Section
6.02 notwithstanding, (i) neither Seller nor Abbott shall be obligated to, and
the use of reasonable best efforts by each of Seller and Abbott shall in no
event require Seller, Abbott or any of their respective Affiliates to, take,
or cause to be taken, any actions or do, or cause to be done, or assist and
cooperate in the doing of, anything that Abbott, in its reasonable discretion,
determines would (A) contravene any covenant or agreement set forth in the
Merger Agreement or (B) result in the staff of the FTC, the European
Commission, or any other antitrust or competition Governmental Authority not
recommending to such applicable Governmental Authority the approval of, or
such applicable Governmental Authority not approving (1) the Merger Agreement,
the Merger Transaction or the Other Transactions or (2) this Agreement, the
Transactions and Purchaser as the purchaser of the Triage Business, the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities for all Merger Clearances
conditioned upon the divestiture of the Triage Business and (ii) Seller and
Abbott may, and may cause their respective Affiliates to, take, or cause to be
taken, any actions contemplated by or otherwise taken in furtherance of or in
connection with (A) the Merger Transaction or (B) the entry into or
performance under any Company Acquisition Agreement (as defined in the Merger
Agreement).

SECTION 6.03. Public Announcements. Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Seller and Abbott, on the other hand, shall consult with the other(s) before
issuing, and give the other(s) the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or similar public statements with respect to the Transactions,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such similar public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, Judgment, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, this Section 6.03 shall not apply to any press release or
similar public statement made by Seller, Purchaser or Abbott (a) which is
consistent with any press release or similar public statement mutually agreed
by Purchaser, Seller and Abbott, and the terms of this Agreement and does not
contain any information relating to Seller, Abbott, Purchaser Parent,
Purchaser or the Transactions that has not been previously announced or made
public in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.03 or (b) which is made
in the ordinary course of business and does not relate to this Agreement or
the Transactions.

SECTION 6.04. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.01, (1) upon reasonable notice, Seller shall afford to Purchaser
and Purchaser's Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to each Asset Seller Entity's officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
Contracts and records (in each case to the extent related to the Triage
Business and other than any of the foregoing that relate to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Other Transactions
or any other transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the
Transactions or proposals from other parties relating to any competing or
alternative transactions) and (2) Seller shall furnish promptly to Purchaser
and Purchaser's Representatives such information to the extent concerning the
Triage Business and its personnel, assets, Liabilities and properties as
Purchaser may reasonably request, including the information set forth on
Schedule 6.04(a)(i); provided that (i) Purchaser and its Representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of Seller or its Affiliates and (ii) Abbott
shall be provided copies of any information provided to Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 6.04(a) and afforded reasonable prior notice of, and the
opportunity to accompany Purchaser's and Seller's respective Representatives
in connection with, any access by Purchaser or its Representatives provided
pursuant to this Section 6.04(a); provided further, however, that Seller shall
not be obligated to provide such access or information if Seller determines,
in its reasonable judgment, that doing so is reasonably likely to (A) violate
applicable Law or an applicable Judgment, (B) jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection or other legal
privilege or (C) expose Seller or its Affiliates to risk of Liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information. In any such event, Seller
shall use its reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law,
Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege or protection or risk
such Liability, including entering into a joint defense agreement, common
interest agreement or other similar arrangement. All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be directed to the Person designated
by Seller on Schedule 6.04(a)(ii) with a copy to the Person designated by
Abbott thereon (or in each case, any replacement thereto, as to which
Purchaser receives written notice).

(b) The terms of the letter agreement related to confidentiality, dated as of
November 15, 2016, among Seller, Purchaser Parent and Abbott, as amended on
February 16, 2017 (as so amended, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this Section
6.04(b) shall terminate; provided, however, that, from and after the Closing,
except as would have been permitted under the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to, treat and hold as confidential, and not
disclose to any Person, (i) information related to the discussions and
negotiations among the Parties and Abbott regarding this Agreement and the
Transactions and (ii) all confidential information relating to Seller, Abbott
or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(c) Nothing provided to Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.04(a) shall in any way
amend or diminish Purchaser's obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.
Purchaser

Affiliates or their respective Representatives pursuant to Section 6.04(a) or
otherwise by or on behalf of Seller, Abbott or their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective Representatives shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) From and after the Closing:

(i) (A) Each of Seller and Abbott agree to, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, not use any Triage Confidential Information for a period of (1)

within the Triage Confidential Information and (2) five (5) years with respect
to all other Triage Confidential Information, and (B) each of Seller and
Abbott agree to, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, and shall use

Trade Secrets included within the Triage Confidential Information and (2) five
(5) years with respect to all other Triage Confidential Information, treat and
hold as confidential (and not (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement) disclose or provide access to any Person (other

Representatives) to) any Triage Confidential Information, unless, in the case
of each of sub-clause (A) and (B), such information: (w) is or becomes
generally available to the public through no direct or indirect disclosure in

similar process, or by the rules or regulations of any stock exchange on which
its Securities or those of an Affiliate are traded), such Person shall provide
Purchaser (to the extent permitted by Law and reasonably practicable) with
prompt written notice of such requirement so that Purchaser may seek, at
Purchaser's sole expense, a protective order or other remedy or waive
compliance with this Section 6.04(d), and in the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained, or Purchaser waives compliance with
this Section 6.04(d), furnish only that portion of such Triage Confidential
Information which is legally required to be provided.

Nothing in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 6.04(d) shall prohibit Seller,
Abbott, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
from using the Triage Confidential Information described in this Section
6.04(d) for the purpose of complying with the terms of this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements, including any Contract that has not been assigned
or transferred pursuant to Section 2.01. Furthermore, the provisions of this
Section 6.04(d) will not prohibit any retention pursuant to Section 6.10 of
Archived Records or any other retention of copies of records or any disclosure
in connection with the preparation and filing of financial statements or Tax
Returns of Seller, Abbott or any of their respective Affiliates or any 



disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions.

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Seller and Abbott hereby assign to Purchaser
their respective rights under any confidentiality agreements entered into by

Products in the Territories; provided that if, during the period of two (2)
years after the Closing Date, the management of Purchaser is not aware of any

expenses incurred in providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal
fees and disbursements) by the Person party hereto (or Affiliate thereof, as

employees and agents, but not including reimbursing such Person (or Affiliate
thereof, as the case may be) or its officers, directors, employees and agents
for their time spent in such cooperation.

(c) If, following the Closing:

(i) any right, property or asset not forming part of the Purchased Assets or
otherwise constituting an Excluded Asset is found to have been transferred to
Purchaser in error, either directly or indirectly, or received by Purchaser,
Purchaser shall transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates to transfer, at no
cost to Seller, Abbott or their Affiliates, such right, property or asset (and
any related Liability) as soon as reasonably practicable to Seller, Abbott or
their Affiliate as directed in writing by Seller;

(ii) any right, property or asset forming part of the Purchased Assets is
found to have been retained by any Asset Seller Entity in error, either
directly or indirectly, or received by any Asset Seller Entity, Seller shall,
or shall cause the other applicable Asset Seller Entity to transfer, at no
cost to Purchaser, such right, property or asset (and any related Liability,
to the extent an Assumed Liability) as soon as reasonably practicable to the
applicable Designated Purchaser; and 



(iii) any right, property or asset that, if held by an Asset Seller Entity
would have formed part of the Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 2.01(a), is
found to have been held as of the Closing by an Affiliate of Seller that is
not an Asset Seller Entity, Seller shall cause such Affiliate to transfer, at
no cost to Purchaser, such right, property or asset (and any related
Liability, to the extent an Assumed Liability) as soon as reasonably
practicable to the applicable Designated Purchaser.

(a) Effective as of the Closing and subject to the terms of the Existing

and royalty-free sublicenseable right and license to Exploit the patents and
patent applications listed on Schedule 6.12(a) (including all reissues,
divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part and extensions thereof) solely

SECTION 6.13. Financing.

(a) Purchaser and Purchaser Parent each shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and to consummate the
Financing (or any Alternative Financing) on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions related thereto),
subject to any amendments or modifications thereto permitted by Section
6.13(b), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect
the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements

Purchaser or its Affiliates, (iv) upon the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions, consummate the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date,
including by drawing on any interim or bridge financing facilities
contemplated thereby, (v) obtain such third-party consents as may be
reasonably required in connection with the Financing, and (vi) comply with its
obligations under the Commitment Letter. If Purchaser or Purchaser Parent
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes procurement of any
portion of the Financing reasonably unlikely to occur in the manner or from
the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Abbott and Seller and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable
any such portion from alternative sources on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser and its Affiliates
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and that
would not have any of the effects prohibited pursuant to amendment by Section
6.13(b) (such financing, the "Alternative Financing"). Purchaser shall (A)
give Abbott and Seller prompt oral and written notice of (1) any breach or
default by Purchaser or its Affiliates of the Commitment Letter, Alternative
Financing or definitive financing agreements related thereto, (2) any known
breach or default by any party (other than Purchaser or its Affiliates) of the

the Commitment Letter, Alternative Financing or definitive financing
agreements related thereto or (4) the receipt of notice of any material
dispute or disagreement between or 



among the parties to the Commitment Letter, Alternative Financing or
definitive financing agreements related thereto, and (B) upon request,
otherwise keep Abbott and Seller reasonably informed of the status of
Purchaser's and its Affiliates' efforts to arrange the Financing or
Alternative Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser and
Purchaser Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of Abbott, (i)
permit any termination, amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or Fee Letters if such
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (A) adds new conditions
to the Financing, (B) modifies any existing conditions to the Financing in a
manner that affects the consummation of all or any portion of the Financing to
below a level that would impair Purchaser's ability to consummate the
Transactions, (B) reduces the committed amount of the Financing, (C) adversely
affects in any material respect the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements in
respect thereof, or (D) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or delay in any material respect the consummation of the Closing or the
Transactions, or (ii) undertake any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, Contract or debt or equity financing that could reasonably
be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing
contemplated by any new debt commitment letter.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Abbott shall, at Purchaser's cost and
expense, use reasonable best efforts to, and to cause its Representatives to,
provide to Purchaser such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Purchaser
in connection with the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller, Abbott
and their respective Affiliates). Such assistance shall include the following:
(i) assisting in preparation for and participation in customary marketing
efforts related to the Financing or the Alternative Financing, as applicable
with prospective lenders, investors and ratings agencies, (ii) assisting
Purchaser and the Financing Sources in the preparation of (A) a customary
offering document, private placement memorandum and/or bank information
memorandum and similar marketing documents for the Financing or the
Alternative Financing, as applicable, and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, (iii) furnishing Purchaser and the Financing Sources the
Required Information; and (iv) facilitating Purchaser's preparation of
documentation with respect to the pledging of collateral, if applicable. In
addition, Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser
and the Financing Sources the Required Information in a manner that, taken as
a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact regarding
the Purchased Assets or the Triage Business or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein regarding the Purchased
Assets or the Triage Business not materially misleading in the light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of Abbott, Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates or other Representatives shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee, provide any security, execute any document,
make any representations, provide any indemnification or incur any other
expense or Liability in connection with the Financing or the cooperation
contemplated by this Section 6.13(d), (ii) none of Abbott, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates or other Representatives shall be required to
provide any solvency opinion or legal opinion or other opinion of counsel, or
any information that would, in the reasonable opinion of Abbott or Seller,
result in a violation of Law or loss of attorney-client privilege, (iii)
Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by Abbott or Seller, reimburse Abbott,
Seller and their respective Affiliates for all out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by any of them (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
other fees and expenses as incurred) in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by this Section 6.13(d) and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Abbott, Seller and their respective Affiliates from and against any and all
Liabilities incurred by 



any of them in connection with the Financing or the cooperation contemplated
by this Section 6.13(d) and (iv) none of Abbott, Seller or their respective
Affiliates, or any Persons who are directors of any of the foregoing, shall be

or its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 6.13(d) shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 6.04.

Alternative Financing or any other funds or financing by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates be a condition to any of Purchaser's or Purchaser Parent's
obligations under this Agreement.

employees of the Asset Seller Entities who perform services for the Triage
Business and to whom a Designated Purchaser may make an offer of employment

accepts an offer shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Transactions and shall be extended in accordance with this Agreement and
applicable Law.

SECTION 7.02. Compensation and Employee Benefits.

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (as defined in the
Merger Agreement, and such period, the "Continuation Period"), Purchaser shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Transferred Employee (i) base
salary and annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable, in each
case, than those in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would
have been provided to such Transferred Employee under the applicable severance
benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements as in effect on
the date hereof, and (iii) employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than
base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive opportunities, severance
benefits and employee stock purchase plan benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Transferred Employees 



immediately prior to the Closing, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), except

Affiliates, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all
purposes (except as set forth below), including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals, each Transferred
Employee's service with Seller and its Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of Seller or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by Seller or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Purchaser and its Affiliates (or
in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets and
business of the Triage Business, its successors and assigns); provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized (i) to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service, (ii) for any purpose under any defined benefit retirement plan,
retiree welfare plan, equity-based incentive plan or long-term incentive plan,
(iii) to the extent not recognized by Seller for similar purposes, or (iv) for

benefit claims incurred by Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
at or after the Closing. Seller or one of its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all welfare benefit claims incurred under any Seller Plan by Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the Closing. Without limiting
the generality of Section 7.02(a), with respect to any "employee welfare
benefit plan" maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which
Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable benefit
plan, program, policy, agreement or other arrangement of Seller or its
applicable Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes
of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate
from and after the Closing.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Sections 12.05 and 12.13, the
provisions of this Section 7.02 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and
no provision of this Section 7.02 (i) is intended to, or shall, constitute the
establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for
purposes of ERISA or otherwise, (ii) obligates Purchaser or any of its 



Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular Transferred Employee
following the Closing or (iii) results in any current or former director,

out of or in connection with the Transactions and any amounts paid or payable
to any Triage Business Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee
because such Triage Business Employee does not accept an offer to transfer
employment, provided the offer of employment made by the applicable Designated
Purchaser to such Triage Business Employee is made pursuant to and in
accordance with the requirements of Sections 7.01(c), 7.02(a), (b) and (c) and
7.05, or (b) to the extent set forth on Schedule 7.03. Purchaser and its

similar termination payments or benefits incurred by Transferred Employees
after the Closing except as set forth on Schedule 7.03.

shall be solely responsible for any payments due to the Transferred Employees
in connection with their equity incentive, bonus and other awards that are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing under any Seller Plan, if
any, including awards under any Transition Award Agreement and any Retention
Bonus Agreement (each as identified in Section 4.09(b) of the Seller

cycle, and Purchaser shall have no obligations under any such Seller Plans or
agreements.

SECTION 7.05. 401(k) Plan. Purchaser shall cause its, or its applicable
Affiliates', qualified defined contribution plan to accept rollover
contributions of all or any portion of the Transferred Employees' vested
account balances under any qualified defined contribution plan of Seller or

account).

ARTICLE VIII 

TAXES

SECTION 8.01. Periodic Taxes. All personal property Taxes and similar ad
valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a Straddle
Period ("Periodic Taxes") shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
of such Straddle Period by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. The
excess of such Periodic Taxes for such Straddle Period over the amount
apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be apportioned to the Post-
Closing Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for the amount of such Periodic
Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period except to the extent payment
therefor had been made prior to Closing. Purchaser shall be liable for the
amount of such Periodic Taxes attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period and
shall reimburse Seller for any portion of the Periodic Taxes attributable to
the Post-Closing Tax Period paid by Seller within ten (10) days of being
notified by Seller of the amount so due. Purchaser shall be responsible for
preparing and filing all Tax Returns for Periodic Taxes required to be filed
after the Closing; provided, however, such Tax Returns shall be subject to the
approval of Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. 



SECTION 8.02. Refunds and Credits. Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled
to retain or, to the extent actually received by or otherwise available to
Purchaser or its Affiliates, receive immediate payment from Purchaser or its
Affiliates of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes (including without
limitation refunds arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
Closing Date or otherwise) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period relating
to the Triage Business or the Purchased Assets. Purchaser shall be entitled to
retain or, to the extent actually received by Seller or its Affiliates,
receive immediate payment from Seller or its Affiliates of, any refund or
credit with respect to Taxes (including without limitation refunds arising by
reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the Closing or otherwise) with
respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period relating to the Triage Business or the
Purchased Assets. Any refunds or credits of Taxes with respect to Straddle
Periods shall be apportioned pursuant to the principles set forth in Section
8.01.

SECTION 8.03. Resolution of Tax Controversies. If, following the Closing, a
claim shall be made by any Governmental Authority that might result in an
indemnity payment to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11.02,
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such claim. If, following the
Closing, a claim shall be made by any Governmental Authority that might result
in an indemnity payment to a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to Section 11.03,
Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of such claim. In the event that a
Governmental Authority determines a deficiency in any Tax, the Party
ultimately, following the Closing, responsible for such Tax under this
Agreement, whether by indemnity or otherwise, shall have authority to
determine whether to dispute such deficiency determination and to control the
prosecution or settlement of such dispute; provided that with respect to
Straddle Periods, the Party with the greater potential Tax burden shall
control the dispute. The Party that is not ultimately responsible for such Tax
under this Agreement shall, following the Closing, have the right to
participate at its own expense in the conduct of any such proceeding involving
a Tax claim that would adversely affect such Party.

SECTION 8.04. Tax Cooperation. From and after the Closing, each of Seller and
Purchaser shall provide the other Party with such information and records and
make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents available as may
reasonably be requested by such other Party in connection with the preparation
of any Tax Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates to the Triage
Business or the Purchased Assets.

SECTION 8.05. Conveyance Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, all transfer, documentary, recording, registration,
stamp and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer
Taxes, but excluding any Taxes based on or attributable to income or capital
gains) together with any notarial and registry fees and recording costs
imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection with the transfer of the
Purchased Assets to the Designated Purchasers ("Conveyance Taxes") will be
shared equally by Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller
and its Affiliates, on the other hand, regardless of which Person is obligated
to pay such Conveyance Taxes under applicable Law; provided, however, that
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall pay and be solely responsible for all value
added, goods and services, sales or other similar Taxes. To the extent that
one Party claims any exemptions from any Conveyance Taxes, such Party shall
provide to the other Party the appropriate exemption certificates. Seller,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates will cooperate in timely making and
filing all Tax Returns that may be required to comply with Law relating to
Conveyance Taxes.

SECTION 8.06. VAT. The Purchase Price shall be exclusive of value added, goods
and services and any other similar Taxes, and if such Taxes are properly
charged or chargeable upon Seller or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall pay Seller (in addition to the Purchase Price) the amount of
such Taxes within five (5) Business Days of receipt 



by Purchaser of notice thereof from Seller and a copy of a Tax invoice in
compliance with local Laws.

SECTION 8.07. Survival of Obligations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the obligations contained in this Article VIII shall survive the
Closing until thirty (30) days after expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, as extended to the maximum extent permitted by Law. In no event
shall an Indemnified Party be indemnified for the same Taxes more than once
(even if such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for such Taxes
pursuant to more than one provision contained in this Agreement).

materiality) as of the Closing (other than such representations and warranties
as are made as of another date, which shall be true and correct as of such
date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof. The covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with or performed by
Purchaser on or before the Closing shall have been complied with or performed
in all material respects. Seller and Abbott shall have received a certificate

(b) (i) The FTC shall have accepted for public comment an Agreement Containing

acquirer; (ii) the European Commission shall have issued a decision approving
the Merger Transaction pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) in conjunction with Article
6(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004 and Purchaser shall have been
approved by the European Commission as the purchaser of the Purchased Assets
and Assumed Liabilities in accordance therewith; (iii) all other Merger
Clearances shall have been received; (iv) approval of this Agreement, the
Transactions and Purchaser as the purchaser of the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities shall have been received by Governmental Authorities for
all Merger Clearances conditioned upon the divestiture of the Triage Business;

required to be delivered to it pursuant to Section 2.10(b).

of clause (d) below shall terminate, at any time prior to the Closing in the
following circumstances:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Abbott;

(b) upon written notice, by Abbott to Purchaser (with a copy to Seller) in the
event that Abbott determines, in its sole discretion to be exercised in good
faith, that the staff of the FTC, the European Commission, or any other
antitrust or competition Governmental Authority is not likely to recommend the
approval of, or such applicable Governmental Authority is not likely to
approve, this Agreement, the Transactions or Purchaser as the purchaser of the
Triage Business, the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities for all Merger
Clearances conditioned upon the divestiture of the Triage Business;

(c) by either Purchaser or Abbott, upon written notice to the non-terminating
Person (with a copy to Seller), if any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a Judgment permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such Judgment shall have become
final and non-appealable, provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.01(c) shall not be available to either
Purchaser or Abbott if such Judgment was due to the failure of such Person (or
in the case of termination by Abbott, Seller) to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement or due to the breach by such Person (or in
the case of termination by Abbott, Seller) of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement;

(d) immediately, without any action by any Party or Abbott, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated;

(e) by Purchaser, if Seller shall have materially breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.01(a) and (ii) is
incapable of being cured within ninety (90) calendar days after the
consummation of the Merger Transaction (the "End Date") or, if capable of
being cured by the End Date, Seller shall not have commenced good-faith
efforts to cure the breach or failure to perform within thirty (30) calendar
days following (or the breach or failure to perform is not cured within sixty
(60) calendar days following) receipt by Seller of written notice from
Purchaser of the breach or failure to perform; provided, that Purchaser shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.01(e) if Purchaser is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement,
which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 9.02(a); 



(f) by Abbott, if Purchaser shall have materially breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) and (ii) is
incapable of being cured by the End Date or, if capable of being cured by the
End Date, Purchaser shall not have commenced good-faith efforts to cure the
breach or failure to perform within thirty (30) calendar days following (or
the breach or failure to perform is not cured within sixty (60) calendar days
following) receipt by Purchaser of written notice from Abbott (with a copy to
Seller) of the breach or failure to perform; provided, that Abbott shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(f)
if Abbott or Seller is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, which breach would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 9.01(a) or
Section 9.01(b); or

(g) by Purchaser or Abbott, if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to
the End Date, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.01(g) shall not be available to (i) Abbott if the failure of the
Closing to have occurred by the End Date was due to the failure of Seller or
Abbott to perform any of their respective obligations under this Agreement or
due to the breach of the representations and warranties of Seller or Abbott
set forth in this Agreement or (ii) Purchaser if the failure of the Closing to
have occurred by the End Date was due to the failure of Purchaser to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement or due to the breach of the
representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in compliance with Section 10.01, this Agreement shall be terminated
and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
Liability or obligation on the part of any Party, Purchaser Parent or Abbott
(or any shareholder or Representative of such Party, Purchaser Parent or
Abbott), other than Section 1.03 (Interpretation), Section 6.03 (Public
Announcements), this Section 10.02 and Article XII (including the definitions
used in each such Section; but excluding Section 12.07), all of which shall
survive such termination; provided, that nothing in this Section 10.02 shall
relieve any Party or Abbott from Liability for any Fraud or knowing, material
and intentional breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI 

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 11.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties of Abbott, Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date; provided, however that (a) the representations and warranties of
Seller contained in Section 4.12 (Intellectual Property) shall survive the
Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date,
and (b) (i) the representations and warranties of Abbott contained in Section
3.01 (Organization; Standing), Section 3.02 (Corporate Authorization;
Noncontravention) and Section 3.04 (Brokers and Other Advisors), (ii) the
Fundamental Representations, and (iii) the representations and warranties of
Purchaser contained in Section 5.01 (Organization; Standing), Sections 5.02(a)
and (b) (Corporate Authorization) and Section 5.07 (Brokers and Other
Advisors) shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
thereof, whether automatic or permissive). All covenants contained in this
Agreement which are to be performed prior to the Closing shall terminate on
the Closing Date. The covenants contained in this Agreement which are to be
performed at or after the Closing shall terminate thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
thereof, whether automatic or permissive). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
representation, warranty, 



covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement shall survive the time at
which it would otherwise expire pursuant to this Section 11.01 if, prior to
such time, a Third Party Claim Notice or Direct Claim Notice with respect to
the breach shall have been timely delivered to the Party against whom such
indemnity may be sought in accordance with Section 11.05. Any claim not
asserted in accordance with this Article XI on or prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period set forth in this Section 11.01 will be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

SECTION 11.02. Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the provisions of this
Article XI, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and
its Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and
against the items described on Schedule 11.02 and all Losses actually suffered
or incurred by them to the extent arising out of or related to: (a) any breach
of any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement, (b)
nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part
of Seller contained in this Agreement, or (c) any Excluded Liability.

SECTION 11.03. Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the provisions of this
Article XI, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and
its Affiliates and each such entity's respective officers, directors, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and
against all Losses actually suffered or incurred by them to the extent arising
out of or related to: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser in this Agreement, (b) nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, or
(c) any Assumed Liabilities.

SECTION 11.04. Limitations on Indemnifiable Losses.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) no indemnification payments will be made by or on behalf of Seller
pursuant to Section 11.02(a) in respect of any individual claim or series of
claims having the same nature or origin where the aggregate Losses relating to
such claims or series of claims are less than $150,000, and such claims or
series of claims with Losses relating thereto of less than $150,000 will not
be aggregated or counted for purposes of calculating the Deductible in clause
(ii) below;

(ii) no indemnification payments will be made by or on behalf of Seller
pursuant to Section 11.02(a) until the aggregate amount of Losses for which
Seller would (but for this clause (ii)) be liable thereunder exceeds one
percent (1%) of the Initial Purchase Price (such amount being, the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent of such excess over the Deductible;
provided, that the Deductible shall not apply to Losses arising out of or
relating to the breach of any Fundamental Representation;

(iii) the aggregate total amount in respect of which Seller will be liable to
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section
11.02(a) and Schedule 11.02 will not exceed eight percent (8%) of the Initial
Purchase Price (such amount being the "Cap"); provided, that the Cap shall not
apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the breach of any Fundamental
Representation; and

(iv) subject to Section 11.04(a)(iii), the aggregate total amount in respect
of which Seller will be liable to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant
to Section 11.02(a) and (b) and Schedule 11.02 shall not exceed the Initial
Purchase Price. 



For clarity, the Cap and the limitation in Section 11.04(a)(iv) do not apply
to Losses actually suffered or incurred to the extent arising out of or
related to any Excluded Liability.

(b) For all purposes of this Article XI, "Losses" shall be net of any
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements actually received by or paid to an Indemnified Party with
respect to such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.

(c) In the event a Person seeks indemnification under this Article XI for any
Losses, Purchaser (if such Person is a Purchaser Indemnitee) or Seller (if
such Person is a Seller Indemnitee) shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions as may be reasonably required or necessary to
mitigate, to the extent practicable, such Losses (including, to the extent
commercially reasonable, pursuing in good faith available insurance coverage,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements).

(d) Any indemnity provided hereunder by Seller shall be so applied as to avoid
any double counting and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to obtain
indemnification more than once for the same Losses pursuant to this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement, the BNP Purchase Agreement or any other Contract
entered between the Parties or their respective Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the BNP Purchase Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Article XI, the representations and warranties of
Seller shall not be deemed qualified by any reference to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" (other than the Specified Qualifications).

SECTION 11.05. Indemnity Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) Third Party Claims.

(i) Any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnification
under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to any claim
asserted or threatened against the Indemnified Party by a Third Party (a
"Third Party Claim") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under Section 11.02 or Section 11.03, as applicable, shall
promptly deliver to the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") a written
notice (a "Third Party Claim Notice") setting forth a description in
reasonable detail of the nature of the Third Party Claim or, in the
alternative, include a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third
Party Claim (if any); provided, however, that the failure to so transmit a
Third Party Claim Notice shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's obligations
under this Article XI, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is asserted against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if the Indemnifying Party delivers a written notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice (or
sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) stating that the
Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim and specifying any reservations to its defense (except that the failure
to so specify any reservation to its defense in a timely delivered written
notice shall not affect the validity of such written notice unless the
Indemnified Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure), the
Indemnifying Party may assume and control the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and settle such Third Party Claim at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, except
with the written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any settlement or
consent to entry of 



any Judgment that (A) does not include the provision by the Person(s)
asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of a full, unconditional and
irrevocable release from all Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim,
(B) includes an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on
behalf of any Indemnified Party, (C) includes injunctive or other nonmonetary
relief affecting any Indemnified Party other than nonmonetary relief
incidental to the monetary damages that does not restrict the operation of the
business of the Indemnified Party, or (D) if the Indemnifying Party is Seller,
includes monetary amounts in respect of, or that would be, Assumed
Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for legal fees or expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, that the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense); provided further, that if, based on the reasonable
opinion of legal counsel to the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, a conflict or potential conflict of interest exists
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party which makes
representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct, the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall constitute indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article XI;
provided further that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for
more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party may retain or take over the control of the defense or settlement of any
Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnifying Party has elected to
control if the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnity
under this Article XI and fully releases the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume and
control the defense of any Third Party Claim or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election within thirty (30) days after receipt of a
Third Party Claim Notice, then such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
continue to conduct and control the defense of such Third Party Claim and the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim shall constitute
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article XI.

(iii) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the
investigation, prosecution or defense of any Third Party Claim. Such
cooperation shall, upon reasonable notice to the Party providing such
cooperation, include (A) providing, and causing their respective Affiliates to
provide, documentary or other evidence in its possession or control that is
reasonably related to the Third Party Claim, (B) implementing, and causing
their respective Affiliates to implement, reasonable record retention or
litigation hold policies and (C) making available, and causing their
respective Affiliates to make available, directors, officers and employees to
give depositions or testimony. Except as otherwise provided in Section
11.05(a)(ii), the Party requesting such cooperation shall pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such cooperation (including
reasonable legal fees and disbursements) by the Party (or Affiliate thereof,
as the case may be) providing such cooperation and by its officers, directors,
employees and agents, but not including reimbursing such Party (or Affiliate
thereof, as the case may be) or its officers, directors, employees and agents
for their time spent in such cooperation.

(b) Direct Claims. If any Indemnified Party has a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this Article XI that does not involve a Third Party
Claim being asserted or threatened against such Indemnified Party (a "Direct
Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying
Party a written notice (a "Direct Claim Notice") setting forth a description
in reasonable detail of the nature of the Direct Claim; provided, that the
failure to so transmit a Direct Claim Notice shall not affect the Indemnifying
Party's obligations under this Article XI, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. 



SECTION 11.06. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. For all Tax purposes, the
Parties and Abbott agree to treat all payments made under any indemnity
provisions contained in this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price,
except to the extent applicable Law requires otherwise.

SECTION 11.07. Exclusivity. Except in cases of Fraud, from and after the
Closing, recovery pursuant to this Article XI shall constitute Abbott's and
the Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims relating to or
arising from this Agreement or the Transactions, and each Party and Abbott
hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all other rights, remedies, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contributions, if any), whether in contract, tort
or otherwise, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may
arise in the future, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local
Law, that any Party or Abbott may have against the other Persons party hereto
relating to or arising from this Agreement or the Transactions; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to deny (a) any Party
equitable remedies (including injunctive relief or specific performance) when
any such remedy is otherwise available under this Agreement or applicable Law,
or (b) any Party or any of their respective Affiliates any remedies under any
Ancillary Agreement, and the foregoing shall not interfere with or impede the
resolution of disputes relating to (i) the determination of the Final
Allocation by the Allocation Firm pursuant to Section 2.06 or (ii) the
determination of Final Transferred Inventory by the Consultant pursuant to
Section 2.11. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations
of Seller and Abbott under this Agreement are several and not joint.

ARTICLE XII 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 12.01. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties and
Abbott. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment or supplement of this
last sentence of Section 12.01, Section 12.03, the last sentence of Section
12.05, Section 12.06, Section 12.07, Section 12.08 and Section 12.13(b) to the
extent such amendment would directly impact and is adverse to the interests of
a Lender under such Sections, shall also be approved by written consent of the
adversely affected Lender.

SECTION 12.02. Extension of Time; Waiver, Etc. Any agreement on the part of
any of Purchaser, Seller or Abbott to extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Persons party to this
Agreement or to waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such Person; provided further, that any such agreement on the
part of Purchaser or Seller shall only be valid if such instrument is also
signed on behalf of Abbott. The failure or delay of any of Purchaser, Seller
or Abbott to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any of Purchaser, Seller or Abbott of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

SECTION 12.03. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any Party or Abbott without the prior
written consent of each Party and Abbott, except that, (i) without the prior
written agreement of Seller, Purchaser may assign as collateral security its
respective rights hereunder to any of its Financing Sources and (ii) 



following the Closing, no consent shall be required in connection with a
merger, consolidation or similar change-in-control transaction of Abbott,
Purchaser Parent or any successor thereto. No assignment by any Party or
Abbott shall relieve such Person of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject
to the immediately preceding two (2) sentences, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties,
Abbott and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this Section 12.03 shall be null and void.

SECTION 12.04. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and Abbott and delivered
to each of the other Persons party hereto.

SECTION 12.05. Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
including the Seller Disclosure Letter, together with the Ancillary
Agreements, the BNP Purchase Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, Abbott and their
Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof; provided, however, that (a) as between Seller and Abbott, nothing
herein shall (or be deemed or in any way interpreted to) supersede, modify,
waive, amend, interpret, or constitute an admission regarding, the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement or of that certain Confidentiality
Agreement, dated January 5, 2016, by and between Seller and Abbott and (b)
nothing herein shall (or be deemed or in any way interpreted to) supersede,
modify, waive, amend, interpret, or constitute an admission regarding, the
terms of the BNP Purchase Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to and
does not confer upon any Person other than the Parties and Abbott any rights
or remedies hereunder, except for (i) Purchaser Parent to the extent expressly
set forth herein, including Section 10.02, (ii) Article XI, which are intended
to be enforceable by the Persons specified therein and (iii) the last sentence
of Section 12.01, Section 12.03, the last sentence of Section 12.05, Section
12.06, Section 12.07, Section 12.08 and Section 12.13(b), which are intended
to be for the benefit of the Financing Sources, who shall be express third
party beneficiaries to the extent such Sections relate to the Financing
Sources.

SECTION 12.06. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement and all claims arising in whole or in part out of, related
to, based upon, or in connection herewith or the subject matter hereof,
including, without limitation, the Commitment Letter, the Financing and the
transactions contemplated thereby and any claims arising in whole or in part
out of, related to, based upon, or connection with the Commitment Letter, the
Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other
jurisdiction that would result in the application of the Laws of any other
jurisdiction.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any
Action against any Financing Source arising out of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter, the Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby,
shall be heard and determined in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York located in the City of New York, New York (or,
if the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
located in the City of New York, New York declines to accept jurisdiction over
any Action, in the New York State Court located in the City of New York,
Borough of Manhattan, New York) and the Parties and Abbott hereby irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such
Action and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum, improper
venue or 



lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 12.06(b) shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of New York and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties and Abbott.
Each Party and Abbott agrees that service of process upon such Person, as
applicable, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth
in Section 12.09. The Parties and Abbott agree that a final judgment in any
such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law;
provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Party's or
Abbott's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal
from, a trial court judgment.

SECTION 12.07. Specific Enforcement. The Parties and Abbott agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the Parties and Abbott fail to take any
action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the
following sentence, the Parties and Abbott acknowledge and agree that (a) each
of the Parties and Abbott shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 12.06(b) without proof of damages or otherwise,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right none of Seller, Purchaser or Abbott
would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties and Abbott acknowledge and
agree that any Person party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.07 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 12.07, Seller,
Abbott, their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective
Representatives shall not be entitled to seek specific performance of any
rights of Purchaser, Purchaser Parent, their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and their respective Representatives to cause the Financing to be
funded.

SECTION 12.08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ABBOTT HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE FINANCING OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

SECTION 12.09. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
Party or Abbott hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if

SECTION 12.10. Bulk Sales Laws. Each of the Parties and Abbott hereby waives
and will cause its Affiliates to waive compliance by the other Party and
Abbott and their respective Affiliates with any applicable bulk sale or bulk
transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased
Assets to the applicable Designated Purchaser.

SECTION 12.11. Severability. If any term, condition or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, provided that the Parties and
Abbott shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties and Abbott as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law such that the economic and legal
substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party.

SECTION 12.12. Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the Transactions are
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur
such fees or expenses, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

SECTION 12.13. No Recourse; Waiver of Claims.

(a) The obligations of Abbott under this Agreement may only be enforced
against Abbott, any claims or causes of action for breach of this Agreement by
Abbott may only be made against Abbott, and no other Person (including Seller
or any of its Affiliates) shall have any Liability for any Liabilities of
Abbott for or relating to any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
for any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by Abbott. The obligations
of Seller under this Agreement may only be enforced against Seller, any claims
or causes of action for breach of this Agreement by Seller may only be made
against Seller, and no other Person (including Abbott or any of its
Affiliates) shall have any Liability for any Liabilities of Seller for or
relating to any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for any breach
or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Seller
and Abbott, in each case on behalf of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, partners,
managers, members, stockholders and Representatives, hereby irrevocably waives
any rights or claims against any 



Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the
Financing and the transactions contemplated thereby and each of Seller and
Abbott, in each case on behalf of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, partners,
managers, members, stockholders and Representatives, agrees not to commence
any Action against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter, the Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby and
agrees to cause any such Action asserted by Seller, Abbott or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, partners, managers, members, stockholders
and Representatives, in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letter,
the Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby to be dismissed or
otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any
Liability for any claims or damages to Seller, Abbott or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, partners, managers, members, stockholders
and Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letter,
the Financing or the transactions contemplated thereby.

SECTION 12.14. Rescission. In the event the FTC shall not have approved on or
prior to the Closing Date the final Decision and Order issued by it in
disposition of its proceeding relating to the Merger Transaction, and
following the Closing Date, the FTC shall have notified Abbott that, for
purposes thereof, Purchaser would not be an acceptable purchaser of the Triage
Business and that the Transactions are required to be rescinded, then Abbott
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Parties, and the Parties and
Abbott shall promptly take all actions as may be necessary or desirable to
rescind the consummation of the Transactions and to restore to each Party and
Abbott its rights, powers and obligations as in existence immediately prior to
the Closing, including (a) Seller refunding to Purchaser all funds received by
Seller from Purchaser as payment of the Purchase Price, (b) execution by
Purchaser of such assignments, transfers and other documents and instruments
as may be necessary or desirable to convey, assign and transfer back to the
applicable Asset Seller Entities all of any Designated Purchaser's right,
title and interest in and to any Purchased Assets and to terminate and cancel
the Ancillary Agreements, and (c) execution by the applicable Asset Seller
Entities of such assumptions and other documents and instruments as may be
necessary or desirable to relieve each Designated Purchaser of Liability for
any Assumed Liabilities existing on the Closing Date and to terminate and
cancel the Ancillary Agreements.

SECTION 12.15. Guarantee. Purchaser Parent ("Guarantor") irrevocably
guarantees each and every covenant and obligation of Purchaser and the full
and timely performance of its obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including the performance of any of Purchaser's indemnity
obligations under this Agreement), in each case, on the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof. This is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not
of collection, and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is
full and unconditional, and no release or extinguishments of Purchaser's
Liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee. Guarantor hereby
waives, for the benefit of Abbott and Seller, (a) any right to require Abbott
or Seller as a condition of payment or performance of Guarantor to proceed
against Purchaser or pursue any other remedies whatsoever and (b) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by Law that limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available to
Purchaser. Guarantor understands that Abbott and Seller are relying on this
guarantee in entering into this Agreement.
