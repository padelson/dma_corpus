THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 20, 2000
(the "Agreement"), among WEBMETHODS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
WOLF ACQUISITION, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and ACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company have each approved the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub
with and into the Company, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, which Merger will result in, among other things, the Company becoming
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and have approved and declared this
Agreement advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders;   WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of, and an
inducement to, Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
holders of Company Common Stock (as defined herein), are entering into a
Stockholders\' Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy dated as of the date hereof
(the "Company Stockholders\' Agreement") in the form of Exhibit A attached
hereto, providing for certain actions relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;   WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness
of, and an inducement to, Company to enter into this Agreement,
contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain
holders of Parent Common Stock (as defined herein), are entering into a
Voting Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Parent Voting Agreement")
in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, providing for certain actions
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   WHEREAS, as a
condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Parent and the Company
to enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company and Parent are entering into a
Strategic Relationship Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Strategic
Relationship Agreement") in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto in order to
initiate a strategic relationship between the Company and Parent in the event
that the Merger could be delayed or not consummated;   WHEREAS, for federal
income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a tax-
free reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and
368(a)(2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");
and   WHEREAS, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify for "pooling of interests" treatment.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:  6   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL, (a) Merger Sub shall merge with
and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation")
and shall continue to be governed by Delaware law as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent and (c) the separate corporate existence of the Company
with all of its assets, property rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in
this Article I.   1.2 Effective Time. As promptly as practicable after
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by (i) executing and filing on the Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as
required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and (ii) making such other filings and taking such other actions as may
be required by Law to make the Merger effective hereinafter. The Merger shall
become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later date and time as
may be specified in the Certificate of Merger by mutual agreement of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company (the date and time the merger becomes effective
being the "Effective Time").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the assets,
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4
Certification of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time and without any
further action on the part of the parties hereto, (a) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in its
entirety as set forth in Exhibit D attached hereto until thereafter amended
as provided by the DGCL and (b) the Bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by
the DGCL.   1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporation\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation.    -2-  7      1.6 Conversion of
Company Common Stock, Etc. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the parties hereto or the holders of the
following securities:   (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article I,
each share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of the Company Common Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and subject to Section 1.8) will be
converted automatically into the right to receive 0.527 fully paid and
nonassessable shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the "Parent Common Stock"), of Parent (the "Merger
Consideration").   (b) Each share of the Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.10 hereof, without
interest.   (c) Each share of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by Parent
or Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   (d) Each share of Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall continue to evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
1.7 Stock Options and Warrants.   (a) The Company and Parent shall take all
requisite action such that, at the Effective Time, all options to purchase
Company Common Stock then outstanding under the Company\'s 1996 Stock Plan
(the "1996 Plan"), the Company\'s 1996A Stock Plan (the "1996A Plan"), the
Company\'s 1999 Stock Plan (the "1999 Stock Plan"), the TransLink Stock
Option Plan (the "TransLink Plan"), the Alier 1996 Stock Option Plan (the
"Alier 1996 Plan"), the Alier 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Alier 1997 Plan"),
and the Company\'s 1999 Director\'s Stock Option Plan (the "1999 Director\'s
Plan", together with the 1996 Plan, 1996A Plan, the 1999 Plan, the TransLink
Plan, the Alier 1996 Plan and the Alier 1997 Plan, the "Option Plans") by
virtue of the Merger and, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
Section 5.6, without any action on the part of the holder thereof.    
-3-  8     (b) The Company and its Board of Directors shall
promptly take all actions necessary to ensure that following the Effective
Time no holder of any options or other rights pursuant to, nor any
participant in or party to, the Option Plans or any other Employee Plan (as
defined herein) or other plan, program, arrangement, agreement or other
commitment providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of
the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company will have
any rights thereunder to acquire equity securities, or any right to payment
in respect of the equity securities, of Parent, the Company, or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except as provided herein.   1.8
Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect
of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   1.9 Fractional Shares.
No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and such fractional
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6 who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to have
been otherwise received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount
of cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent and without interest) equal
to the product of such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest cent) on the Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ") (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported therein, any other
authoritative source selected by Parent) for the 20 trading days ending on
the third trading day immediately prior to (and excluding the date of) the
Effective Time.   1.10 Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the Exchange Agent in the
Merger.   (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. When and as needed, Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with
this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may
adopt, sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged pursuant to
Section 1.6.   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.6, a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have     -4-  9    such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and payment in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 1.6 and 1.9, after
giving effect to any required Tax (as defined herein) withholdings, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. At any time following
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, all or any number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (and any or all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock) deposited with or made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(b), which remain undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock, shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and thereafter such holders of unexchanged
shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
for payment upon due surrender of their Certificates.   (d) Distributions
With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the whole shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 1.9 until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate pursuant to Section 1.10(c). Subject to the effect
of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall
be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at
the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.9 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and payable between the Effective
Time and the time of such surrender with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for
shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than the name
in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
will be a condition of the issuance thereof that (i) the Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and accompanied by all other documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and (ii) either (x) that the Person requesting such
exchange will have paid any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other
than the name of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (y)
established to the satisfaction of Parent, or any agent designated by Parent,
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (f) No Liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Exchange Agent, Parent, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable    -5-  10    to a holder of a Certificate for any Parent
Common Stock (and any cash payable for fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock or any other amount due, if any) that was properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.   (g) Withholding of Tax. Parent or the Exchange Agent will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent shall
determine in good faith they are required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were
made by Parent.   (h) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, no certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock or cash shall be delivered to a
Person who may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company in accordance with
Section 5.8 hereof for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), or for purposes of qualifying the Merger
for pooling of interests accounting treatment under Opinion No. 16 (Business
Combinations) of the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("APB
16") and applicable rules and regulations ("Regulations") of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") until such Person has executed and
delivered a Company Affiliate Pooling Agreement (as defined in Section 5.11)
to Parent.   (i) Unvested Shares. If any shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for
such shares of Company Common Stock shall also be unvested to the same extent
and in accordance with such agreement and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is
entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in
any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.   1.11
Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Article I (including any cash paid
in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock on the records of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided for
herein. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the   
-6-  11    Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.12 Closing. Unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, and
subject to the provisions of Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on a date (the
"Closing Date") to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, which date shall
be not later than the third Business Day after all the conditions set forth
in Article VI shall have been satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section
7.5, to the extent the same may be waived), unless another time and/or date
is agreed by the parties hereto. The Closing shall take place at the offices
of Shaw Pittman, 1676 International Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102 or such
other place as the parties hereto otherwise agree.   1.13 Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates evidencing Company
Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be
required pursuant to Section 1.9; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates

carrying on of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries as officers,
employees or agents by any officer, director or key employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or the conduct or proposed conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, will, to the Company\'s Knowledge, conflict
with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of or
constitute a default under any contract, covenant or instrument under which
any such person is obligated, except where such conflict, breach or default
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.   -26-  31   (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.20(i)

this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the
Merger and any other transactions contemplated hereby, the restrictions on
business combinations of Section 203 of the DGCL. No Delaware law or other
takeover statute or similar Law and no provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, or other organizational documents or governing
instruments of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Material

Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed
to take any action, failed to take any action or is aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent (i) the Merger from
being treated for financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of interests"

from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.   (c) The Company has no
Knowledge of any reason why it may not receive a letter from Deloitte and
Touche LLP (the "Company\'s Accountants") dated as of the Closing Date and

the Company management\'s conclusion that no conditions exist related to the
Company that would preclude Parent from accounting for the Merger as a
"pooling of interests."   (d) Section 2.24(d) of the Company Disclosure

practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under applicable
Law) within 60 days after the declaration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, for the purpose of voting upon adoption of this
Agreement. Subject to Section 5.2(c), the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and will take all other action necessary to

that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Company\'s stockholders in advance of
a vote on this Agreement or (ii) shall (unless Parent otherwise consents in

time for which the Company Stockholders\' Meeting   -45-  50  is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
) or subsequently rescheduled or reconvened, there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting. The Company shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited, in compliance with applicable Law, the
Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of NASDAQ and
all other applicable legal requirements. The Company\'s obligation to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting in
accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer (as defined below), or by any
withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company with respect to this Agreement or the Merger.   (b)

amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the Company that the Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of
this Agreement.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board
of Directors of the Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying its recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer
(as defined below) is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the
Company shall have provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior
Offer") advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior Offer,
specifying all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Offer
and identifying the person or entity making such Superior Offer, (iii) Parent
shall not have, within three business days of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice
of Superior Offer, made an offer that the Company\'s Board of Directors by a
majority vote determines in its good faith judgment (after having received
the written advice of a financial advisor of national standing) to be at
least as favorable to the Company\'s stockholders as such Superior Offer (it
being agreed that the Board of Directors of the Company shall convene a
meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt
thereof), (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of
such recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors of
Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable Law and (v) the Company shall not have violated any of the
restrictions set forth in Section 4.2 or this Section 5.2. The Company shall
provide Parent with at least two business days prior notice of any meeting of
the Company\'s Board of Directors at which the Company\'s Board of Directors
is to consider any Acquisition Proposal to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2(c) shall
limit the Company\'s obligation to hold and convene the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting (regardless of whether the   -46- 
51  recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company shall have been
withdrawn, amended or modified).    (d) For the purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written
offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following transactions:
(i) a merger or consolidation involving the Company pursuant to which the
stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less
than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (ii) a sale or other disposition by the Company of assets
representing in excess of 50% of the fair market value of the Company\'s
business immediately prior to such sale; or (iii) the acquisition by any
person or group (including, without limitation, by way of a tender offer or
an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender offer followed
with reasonable promptness by a merger involving the Company), directly or
indirectly, of ownership of 51% or more of the then outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, on terms that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment (based on the written
advice of a financial advisor of national standing) to be more favorable to
the Company stockholders than the terms of the Merger; provided, however,
that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" unless the
Company or such third party has obtained bona fide firm commitment letters
for any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such
offer.   (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company
or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act.   5.3 Parent Stockholders Meeting.   (a) Promptly after

necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint

of a vote on the approval of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or, if as of the time for which Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus ) there are insufficient shares of Parent Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting.
Parent shall ensure that the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by
Parent in connection with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting are    -47- 
52  solicited, in compliance with applicable Law, its Certificate of

Directors of Parent shall recommend that Parent\'s stockholders approve the

shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Parent
has recommended that Parent\'s stockholders approve such issuance of shares

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or its Board of
Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position

Exchange Act.   5.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality.   (a) Upon

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each party hereto

At the Effective Time, each Outstanding Employee Option, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by Parent. Each such Outstanding Employee Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Option Plans,
option agreements thereunder and other relevant documentation
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any
restrictions on transfer, vesting provisions and restrictive covenants),
except that such Outstanding Employee Option shall be exercisable solely for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable under such
Outstanding Employee Option immediately prior to the    -50- 
55  Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and the per-share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such assumed Outstanding Employee Option shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Outstanding Employee Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; provided, further, that in the
case of any Outstanding Employee Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code
("ISOs"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. The parties
intend that the assumption of options provided for under this Section 5.6
shall meet the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code, and this Section
5.6 shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.   (b)
Parent shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Outstanding Employee Options
assumed by Parent under this Agreement.   (c) The vesting of each
Outstanding Employee Option shall not accelerate as a result of, or in
connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
required by the existing terms of the Option Plan or option agreement
pursuant to which it was granted. The Company shall take no action, and shall
ensure that no discretion is exercised by the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof or any other body or Person so as to cause the vesting of
any Outstanding Employee Option or any other warrant or right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock to accelerate.   (d) The parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree with respect to the treatment
of the Purchase Plan in the Merger on terms not inconsistent with the
Purchase Plan or the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no
event may Company Common Stock be purchased under the Purchase Plan after the
Effective Time.   5.7 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration
statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to assumed Outstanding Employee Options as soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within 30 days
thereof).   5.8 Employee Benefits.   (a) The Company agrees to provide
Parent with, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to provide Parent with,
reasonable access to its employees during normal working hours following the
date of this Agreement, to among other things, provide information about
Parent to such employees. All communications by Parent with Company employees
shall be conducted in a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with the
Company\'s efficient and orderly operation of its business.   (b) All
employees of the Company shall be eligible to participate in the health,
vacation and other employee benefit plans of Parent or a Subsidiary of the
Parent to    -51-  56  substantially the same extent as such benefits
are provided to employees of Parent in similar positions and at similar grade
levels (it being understood that such employees shall be eligible to begin to
participate (i) in Parent\'s employee stock purchase plan upon the
commencement of the first new offering period after the Effective Time and in
accordance with the eligibility provisions of such plan, and (ii) in the
other Parent Employee Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms of such
plans; provided, however, that in the case of plans for which the Company
maintains a plan offering the same type of benefit, such eligibility need not
be offered by Parent or its Subsidiary until the corresponding plan of the
Company ceases to be available after the Effective Time). A Parent Employee
Benefit Plan may, if so continued by Parent or its Subsidiaries, include
continuation of a Benefit Plan of the Company. As soon as administratively
feasible following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to take all reasonable
actions necessary to transition the Company\'s employees into Parent\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' employee benefit plans as contemplated by the first
sentence of this Section 5.8(b). Further, until such time that the Company\'s
employees are covered under an employee benefit plan of Parent, they shall
continue to be covered under the corresponding Company plan that offers the
same type of benefit. Parent also agrees to provide each Company
employee with full credit under any Parent Plan which is an Employee Benefit
Plan for services as an employee of the Company prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and the determination of the level of
benefits under any Parent plan which is an Employee Benefit Plan (including
vacation, but excluding benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension
plan) and shall receive credit under any Parent health plan for any
deductible, copayment or out-of-pocket limits applicable to such employee to
the extent such amounts have been paid by such employee during the calendar
year in which such employee first becomes eligible for coverage under a
Parent plan.   (c) The Company agrees to take all actions necessary
to amend, merge, freeze or terminate any or all compensation and benefit
plans, effective at and contingent upon the Closing Date, as requested in
writing by Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if
requested by Parent in writing at least 10 days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause to be adopted prior to the Effective Time resolutions
of the Company\'s Board of Directors to cease all contributions to the
Company 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), and to terminate the 401(k) Plan at
least one day prior to the Effective Time. Such resolutions shall provide (to
the extent required under Section 411 of the Code) that all participants
shall be fully vested in their account balances under the 401(k) Plan. Such
resolutions shall also authorize distributions of 401(k) Plan balances to
participants (to the extent permitted under Section 401(k)(10) of the Code)
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and following the
Company\'s receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of a favorable
determination letter regarding the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan
following its termination.   (d) The Company shall deliver to Parent an
executed copy of such resolutions as soon as practicable following their
adoption by Company\'s Board of Directors and shall fully comply with such
resolutions. To the extent permitted by Parent\'s 401(k) plan, Parent shall
(i) cause a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or a
subsidiary of Parent (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") to accept rollovers
(including direct rollovers) from the 401(k) plan maintained for the benefit
of employees of the Company and its Affiliates in respect of distributions
made on account of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
allow loan balances of participants who have borrowed from the Parent 401(k)
Plan, if any, to be rolled over without requiring that the participant first
repay the loan. In the event that the Parent 401(k)    -52-  57  Plan
does not permit such loans, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to amend such plan to permit rollovers of such loans in a direct transfer
from the 401(k) Plan.   (e) The Board of Directors of Parent shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, take or cause to be taken all actions
necessary to obtain approval in the form required by Rule 16b-3 of the
Exchange Act so that, with respect to persons who will or may become officers
or directors of Parent, the transactions relating to the Merger that may be
considered acquisitions under such Rule for such persons will be exempt from
Section 16 of the Exchange Act.   5.9 Parent Option Pool. As is reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, subject to the approval of its Board of
Directors, Parent will grant such number of stock options to purchase shares
of Parent Common Stock to the employees of the Company (the "Company Option
Grant") as mutually agreed by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective
Time in order to reasonably provide incentives for, and to retain, such
employees after the Effective Time, and as described in a letter to be
delivered to Parent prior to the Closing Date and approved by Parent promptly
after the Effective Time and consistent with standard Parent practices.  
5.10 Parent Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of Parent will take
all actions reasonably necessary, such that, effective upon the Effective
Time, R. James Green ("Mr. Green") and one other person, as determined by
Parent\'s Board of Directors and the Company, shall be appointed to
Parent\'s Board of Directors.   5.11 Pooling; Reorganization.   (a) The
Company shall not take, or permit any controlled Affiliate of the Company to
take, any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
being treated (i) for financial accounting purposes as a "pooling of
interests" under GAAP; it being understood and agreed that if the Company\'s
Accountants advise the Company in writing that such an action would not
prevent the Merger from being so treated, such action will be conclusively
deemed not to constitute a breach of this Section 5.11 or (ii) as
a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E)
of the Code.   (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain an executed affiliate pooling agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit E (each, a "Company Affiliate Pooling
Agreement") from each of the Persons identified in Section 2.24(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule concurrently with the execution of this Agreement
and thereafter from any other person who may be deemed an affiliate of the
Company regarding compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act and the
requirements for accounting treatment of the Merger as a "pooling of
interests" under APB 16, and the Regulations of the SEC.   (c) Parent shall
not take or permit any controlled Affiliate of Parent to take, any action
that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from being treated

it being understood and agreed that if Parent\'s Accountants, advises Parent
in writing that such an action would not    -53-  58  prevent the Merger
from being so treated, such action will be conclusively deemed not to
constitute a breach of this Section 5.11; or (ii) as a reorganization within
the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.   (d)
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain an executed affiliate
pooling agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F
(each, a "Parent Affiliate Pooling Agreement") from each of the Persons
identified in Section 5.11(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule regarding
compliance with the requirements for accounting treatment of the Merger as a
"pooling of interests."   5.12 Notification of Certain Matters.   (a) The

by its terms by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, then untrue or
inaccurate in any respect) and any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it

to this Section 5.12 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   (b) Each of the

Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers
as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification
or expense advancement provisions under the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date   -55-  60  hereof. The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification
and expense advancement that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified
Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were

on the date of this Agreement, so long as the annual premium therefor would
not be in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of
this Agreement (such amount, the "Maximum Premium"). Upon request by Parent,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to extend coverage under
the Company\'s DandO; Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy
(provided, that the lump sum payment to purchase such coverage does not
exceed three times the Maximum Premium) and such "tail" policy shall satisfy
Parent\'s obligations under this Section 5.14(a). Parent\'s obligations under
this Section 5.14(a) shall also be satisfied if Parent\'s directors and
officers insurance provides (or is amended to provide) substantially similar
coverage and coverage levels for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
for Persons who are directors and officers of the Company on the date of this
Agreement. If the Company\'s existing directors and officers insurance
expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or a "tail"
policy cannot be purchased on the terms set forth above and Parent cannot or
determines not to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.14(a)
pursuant to the preceding sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to be obtained as much directors and officers insurance as
can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium
not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the Company\'s DandO; Insurance.   (c) The provisions of

enforceable by, each Person entitled to the benefits hereof and the heirs and
representatives of such Person.   5.18 Company Stockholders\' Agreement. The
