AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 27, 2019 (this " _Agreement_ "),
by and between Total System Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _TSYS_
"), and Global Payments Inc., a Georgia corporation (" _Global Payments_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Global Payments and TSYS have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies, their
shareholders, and, as permitted under Section 14-202(b)(5) of the Georgia
Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ "), their other constituencies, that
Global Payments and TSYS engage in a "merger of equals" business combination
in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of each of
Global Payments and TSYS;

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Global Payments and TSYS have determined
that such "merger of equals" business combination shall be effected, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in accordance with
the GBCC, through the merger of TSYS with and into Global Payments (the "
_Merger_ "), so that Global Payments is the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving
Entity_ ") in the Merger;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Global
Payments and TSYS have unanimously approved and adopted the Merger and this
Agreement, and have directed that this Agreement be submitted to their
respective shareholders for approval;

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the GBCC, at the Effective Time, TSYS shall merge with and
into Global Payments pursuant to this Agreement. Global Payments shall be the
Surviving Entity in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence
under the laws of the State of Georgia and under the name "Global Payments
Inc." Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
TSYS shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, on a date
which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable law) of all of the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by
TSYS and Global Payments. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
as the " _Closing Date_."

the Closing Date, Global Payments and TSYS, respectively, shall cause to be
filed a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Georgia (the " _Georgia Secretary_ ").
The Merger shall become effective at such time as specified in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the GBCC,
or at such other time as shall be provided by applicable law (such time
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the GBCC.

1.5 _Conversion of TSYS Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Global Payments, TSYS or the
holder of any securities of Global Payments or TSYS:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of TSYS issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _TSYS Common Stock_ "), except for shares of TSYS Common
Stock owned by TSYS or Global Payments (in each case other than shares of
TSYS Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and
the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties), shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.8101 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") of the common stock, without par value, of Global Payments
(the " _Global Payments Common Stock_ "); it being understood that upon the
Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.6, the Global Payments Common Stock,
including the shares issued to former holders of TSYS Common Stock, shall be
the common stock of the Surviving Entity.

(b) All of the shares of TSYS Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ,"
it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of TSYS Common Stock) previously representing any such
shares of TSYS Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) a New Certificate (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_)
representing the number of whole shares of Global Payments Common Stock which
such shares of TSYS Common Stock have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Section 1.5, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of TSYS Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and
Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2, in each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Global Payments Common Stock or TSYS
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split or reverse stock split, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or
distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio to give Global Payments and the holders of TSYS Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ that nothing contained in this sentence shall be construed
to permit TSYS or Global Payments to take any action with respect to its
securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of TSYS Common Stock that are owned by TSYS or
Global Payments (in each case other than shares of TSYS Common Stock held in
trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third
parties) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Global Payments
Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.6 _Global Payments Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Global Payments Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Surviving Entity and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.7 _Treatment of TSYS Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of TSYS Common Stock
(a " _TSYS Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required
action on part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option (a " _Global
Payments Stock Option_ ") to purchase (i) that number of shares of Global
Payments Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject to such TSYS
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Exchange
Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share of Global Payments Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of TSYS Common Stock of such TSYS Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_
, _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of Global
Payments Common Stock shall be determined in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except as expressly provided in
this Section 1.7(a), each such Global Payments Stock Option shall be subject
to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms)
as applied to the corresponding TSYS Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 1.7(e) below, at the Effective Time, each
award in respect of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase
or other lapse restriction (a " _TSYS Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a restricted stock award (a " _Global Payments Restricted Stock Award_ ")
in respect of that number of shares of Global Payments Common Stock (rounded
to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of TSYS Common Stock subject to such TSYS Restricted Stock Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 1.7(b), each such Global Payments Restricted Stock
Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and
exercisability terms) as applied to the corresponding TSYS Restricted
Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 1.7(e) below, at the Effective Time,
each restricted stock unit award, but excluding any TSYS Performance Share
Award (as defined below), in respect of shares of TSYS Common Stock (a " _TSYS
RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into a restricted stock unit award (a " _Global
Payments RSU Award_ ") in respect of that number of shares of Global Payments
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject to such TSYS RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
expressly provided in this Section 1.7(c), each such Global Payments RSU
Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and
payment terms) as applied to the corresponding TSYS RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each performance share award in respect of shares
of TSYS Common Stock (a " _TSYS Performance Share Award_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a Global Payments RSU Award in respect of that number of shares
of Global Payments Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject to such
TSYS Performance Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Section 1.7(c), the number of shares
of TSYS Common Stock subject to a TSYS Performance Share Award with a
performance period that is incomplete (or that is complete but for which
performance is not determinable due to the unavailability of the required
data for relative measures) as of the Effective Time shall be (A) with respect
to the portion of the TSYS Performance Share Award using performance goals
based on Adjusted Diluted EPS Growth or any other performance goal (other
than Relative TSRs), the greater of (x) the number of Initial Shares (as
defined below) and (y) the number of shares subject to such portion of TSYS
Performance Share Award that would have been earned based on actual
performance with respect to the applicable performance goals as of the
Effective Time (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that

 



-3- 

    

 performance can be assessed), with actual performance being measured by
extrapolating performance as of the Effective Time (or the latest practicable
date prior thereto that performance can be assessed) through the scheduled
expiration date of the applicable performance period, and (B) with respect to
the portion of the TSYS Performance Share Award using Relative TSRs, the
greater of (x) the number of Initial Shares and (y) the number of shares
subject to such TSYS Performance Share Award that would have been earned based
on actual performance with respect to the applicable performance goals as of
the Effective Time (or the latest practicable date prior thereto that
performance can be assessed) as if such date were the last day of the
applicable performance period. After the Effective Time, each such Global
Payments RSU Award shall be scheduled to cliff vest, subject to the holders
continued service with the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries, on the last
day of the originally scheduled performance period. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 1.7(d), each such Global Payments RSU Award shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and payment
terms) as applied to the corresponding TSYS Performance Share Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Initial Shares_ " means, with respect to a TSYS Performance Share
Award, the portion of the "initial performance shares" subject to such TSYS
Performance Share Award that is eligible to be earned based on Adjusted
Diluted EPS Growth, Relative TSRs or another performance goal, as applicable
(as determined pursuant to the applicable award agreement). For the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the number of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject
to a TSYS Performance Share Award determined pursuant to this Section 1.7(d)
be greater than the maximum number of shares set forth in the applicable award
agreement.

(e) At the Effective Time, each Single Trigger TSYS Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
shall be converted into that number of fully vested shares of Global Payments
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject to such Single Trigger TSYS
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Single Trigger TSYS Award_ " means each of
the following awards which are held by non-executive officers of TSYS or
its Subsidiaries and currently provide for a "single trigger" vesting (
_i.e._ , that vests automatically solely on account of the occurrence of the
Effective Time) under the terms of the underlying equity plan or award
agreement: (A) performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted with
respect to 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, (B) time-based restricted stock unit
awards (broad-based) granted with respect to 2017, and (C) restricted stock
awards granted in 2016 to NetSpend employees. For purposes of this Section
1.7(e), the number of shares of TSYS Common Stock subject to a Single Trigger
TSYS Award with a performance period that is incomplete (or that is complete
but for which performance is not determinable due to the unavailability of
the required data for relative measures) as of the Effective Time shall be the
greater of (x) the number of "initial shares" subject to such Single Trigger
TSYS Award (as determined pursuant to the applicable award agreement) and (y)
the number of shares subject to such Single Trigger TSYS Award that would have
been earned based on actual performance with respect to the applicable
performance goals as of the Effective Time, with actual performance being
measured by extrapolating performance as of the Effective Time (or the latest
practicable date prior thereto that performance can be assessed) through the
scheduled expiration date of the applicable performance period.

 

(f) As of the Effective Time, the number and kind of shares available for
issuance under each equity incentive plan of TSYS shall be adjusted, in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable plan, to reflect the
conversion of TSYS Common Stock into Global Payments Common Stock.

 

(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, TSYS, the Board of Directors of TSYS
and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.7.

(h) Global Payments shall take all corporate actions that are necessary for
the assumption of the TSYS Equity Awards (as defined below) pursuant to this
Section 1.7, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Global
Payments Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Section 1.7. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Global
Payments shall file with the SEC a post-effective

 



-4- 

    

 amendment to the S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Global
Payments Common Stock underlying the applicable converted TSYS Equity Awards,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such applicable assumed TSYS Equity
Awards remain outstanding.

1.8 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. TSYS shall take all necessary action to
(a) ensure that if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the final
offering period under the TSYS 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _TSYS
ESPP_ "), such final offering period shall end on the Closing Date, and (b)
terminate the TSYS ESPP and distribute to the applicable participants any
shares of TSYS Common Stock or cash held on behalf of the participants in the
TSYS ESPP as of no later than the Effective Time.

 

1.9 _Articles of Incorporation of_ _Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time,
the Articles of Incorporation of Global Payments, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, as amended as set forth in _Exhibit A-1_, shall
be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to receipt of the Global Payments Declassification Vote (as defined
below), the Articles of Incorporation of Global Payments, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be further amended as set
forth in _Exhibit B_ (the " _Declassification Amendment_ "), and as so amended
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Entity until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. 

1.10 _Bylaws of_ _Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Global Payments, as amended as set forth in  _Exhibit A-2_ (such amendment,
the " _Global Payments Bylaw Amendment_ "), shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to receipt of the Global Payments
Declassification Vote and the effectiveness of the Declassification Amendment,
the Bylaws of Global Payments shall be correspondingly amended to give effect
to the Declassification Amendment.

1.11 _Plan of Reorganization_. This Agreement is adopted as a plan of
reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

1.12 _Corporate Governance Guidelines_. As of the Effective Time, the
corporate governance guidelines of the Surviving Entity shall be adopted by
the Board of Directors of the Surviving Entity in accordance with Section
6.12(d).

 

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

2.1 _Global Payments to Make Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Global Payments shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company mutually agreed upon by Global
Payments and TSYS (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in accordance with
this ARTICLE II for the benefit of the holders of Old
Certificates, certificates or, at Global Payments option, evidence in book-
entry form, representing shares of Global Payments Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.5 (referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ "), and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
(such cash and New Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect to shares of Global Payments Common Stock payable in accordance
with Section 2.2(b), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
").

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Global Payments shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old

 



-5- 

    

 Certificates representing shares of TSYS Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive Global Payments Common Stock pursuant to ARTICLE I, a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New
Certificates representing the number of whole shares of Global Payments Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
TSYS Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement
as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section
2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old
Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Global Payments Common Stock to which such holder of TSYS
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE
I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (x) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this ARTICLE II and (y) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares
or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of Global Payments Common
Stock which the shares of TSYS Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Global
Payments Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in
accordance with this ARTICLE II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in
accordance with this ARTICLE II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares
of Global Payments Common Stock that the shares of TSYS Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Global Payments Common Stock
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Global Payments Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of TSYS of the shares of TSYS Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to
the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for New Certificates
representing shares of Global Payments Common Stock as provided in this
ARTICLE II.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Global
Payments Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Global Payments
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the

 



-6- 

    

 owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Global
Payments. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Global
Payments shall pay to each former holder of TSYS Common Stock who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-
sale prices of Global Payments Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
(the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the consecutive
period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing
Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of
TSYS Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time
and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Global Payments Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not
separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of TSYS for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Entity. Any former holders of TSYS Common Stock who have
not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Entity for payment of the shares of Global Payments Common
Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Global Payments Common Stock deliverable in respect of
each former share of TSYS Common Stock such holder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Global Payments, TSYS, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
TSYS Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Global Payments, TSYS and any other person that has any withholding
obligation with respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from any such payment such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made.

 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Global Payments or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person
of a bond in such amount as Global Payments or the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
shares of Global Payments Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TSYS

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by TSYS to Global
Payments concurrently herewith (the " _TSYS Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the TSYS Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by TSYS that such
item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that
such item would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of ARTICLE III shall be
deemed to qualify (1) any other section of ARTICLE III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections

 



-7- 

    

 of ARTICLE III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as
disclosed in any TSYS Reports filed by TSYS since December 31, 2015, and prior
to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under
the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), TSYS hereby represents and warrants to Global Payments as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) TSYS is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Georgia. TSYS has the corporate power
and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. TSYS is duly licensed or
qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of
the properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such
licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where the failure to be
so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on TSYS. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Global Payments, TSYS or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, any effect, change, event, circumstance,
condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, properties, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the
impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability to companies in the industries in which
such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts
or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or
acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
party or its Subsidiaries, (D) the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
public disclosure of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, public
disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (provided,
that the foregoing exceptions shall not apply to the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.3(b), 3.11(i), 4.3(b) or 4.11(i)), actions
expressly required by this Agreement or actions that are taken pursuant to
the written consent of or at the written request of the other party, (E) a
decline in the trading price or trading volume of a partys common stock, a
credit ratings downgrade or change in ratings outlook, in and of itself, for a
party or any of its Subsidiaries or the failure, in and of itself, to meet
earnings projections, earnings guidance or internal financial forecasts, but
not, in each case, including any underlying causes thereof, (F) any changes or
developments resulting from any hurricane, flood, tornado, earthquake or
other weather or natural disaster, or (G) any changes, effects or developments
arising out of, or resulting from or in connection with, the United Kingdoms
withdrawal from the European Union; except, with respect to subclause (A),
(B), (C), (F) or (G) to the extent that the effects of such change are
materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate), in which case only such incremental materially
disproportionate effect shall be taken into account in determining whether
such change has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used
with respect to any person, means any corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, or person of which (x) such first person directly or
indirectly owns or controls at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions or (y) such
first person is or directly or indirectly has the power to appoint a general
partner, manager or managing member or others performing similar functions.
True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of TSYS (the " _TSYS
Articles_ ") and the Bylaws of TSYS (the " _TSYS Bylaws_ "), in each case as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by TSYS to Global Payments.

 



-8- 

    

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on TSYS, each Subsidiary of TSYS (a " _TSYS Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where
such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership,
leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires it to
be so licensed or qualified or in good standing and (iii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of TSYS to pay dividends or
distributions except for restrictions imposed by applicable law or, in the
case of non-wholly owned Subsidiary joint ventures, joint venture agreements
in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Section 3.1(b) of the TSYS
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of
TSYS as of the date hereof. There is no person whose results of operations,
cash flows, changes in shareholders equity or financial position are
consolidated in the financial statements of TSYS other than the TSYS
Subsidiaries.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of TSYS

which TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of

necessary in connection with (i) the execution and delivery by TSYS of this
Agreement or (ii) the consummation by TSYS of the Merger and the other

any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents will not be

connection therewith, except where the failure to file (or furnish, as

Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of TSYS, investigation into the business or operations of TSYS or
any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016, except where such proceedings
or investigations would not reasonably be expected to have, either

Agency with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of
TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016, in each case, which

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TSYS.

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The financial statements of TSYS and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the TSYS Reports (including the related notes,
where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the

material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of TSYS
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective

end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of

-11- 

    

 accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the

consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. To the extent any of the
books and records of TSYS and its Subsidiaries are required to be maintained
in accordance with GAAP, such books and records have been since January 1,
2016, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP. Since December 31, 2015, no independent public accounting firm of TSYS
has resigned (or informed TSYS that it intends to resign) or been dismissed
as independent public accountants of TSYS as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with TSYS on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on TSYS, neither TSYS nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by
GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance sheet of TSYS or in the notes
thereto, except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against
on the consolidated balance sheet of TSYS included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since March 31, 2019, or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of TSYS and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of TSYS or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on TSYS. TSYS (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating to TSYS,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and
the chief financial officer of TSYS by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
TSYSs outside auditors and the audit committee of TSYSs Board of Directors
(i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect TSYSs ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in TSYSs internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures,
if any, were made in writing by management to TSYSs auditors and audit
committee. There is no reason to believe that TSYSs chief executive officer
and chief financial officer and, to the knowledge of TSYS, as of the date
hereof, its outside auditors will not be able to give the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when
next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither TSYS nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to the knowledge of TSYS, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of the TSYS, oral, regarding
the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of
TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in inappropriate accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no employee of or attorney representing TSYS
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by TSYS or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by TSYS or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of TSYS or any committee thereof or the Board
of

 



-12- 

    

 Directors or similar governing body of any TSYS Subsidiary or any committee
thereof, or to the knowledge of TSYS, to any director or officer of TSYS or
any TSYS Subsidiary, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
except as would not reasonably be expected to be, either individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to TSYS and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

Sachs and Co. LLC and Greenhill and Co., LLC, neither TSYS nor any TSYS
Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any
broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers
fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. TSYS has disclosed to Global
Payments as of the date hereof the aggregate fees provided for in connection
with the engagement by TSYS of Goldman, Sachs and Co. LLC and Greenhill and Co.,
LLC related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory

payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any
limitation on the right of TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any TSYS Benefit Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
TSYS or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. TSYS has
provided to Global Payments calculations reflecting a good faith estimate of
the consequences of Sections 280G and 4999 on any "disqualified individuals"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in

character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated
by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Global Payments. True and complete copies of the
Articles of Incorporation of Global Payments (the " _Global Payments

conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified or in good
standing, and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of

by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,

initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Global
Payments, investigation into the business or operations of Global Payments or

balance sheet of Global Payments or in the notes thereto, except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of Global Payments included in its Quarterly Report on Form

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Global Payments or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership that
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Global
Payments. Global Payments (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Global Payments, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Global Payments by others within those entities as

make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent

affect in any material respect Global Payments ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Global Payments internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures, if any, were made in writing by management to Global Payments
auditors and audit committee. There is no reason to believe that
Global Payments chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and, to
the knowledge of Global Payments, as of the date hereof, its outside auditors
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-

knowledge of Global Payments, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Global Payments or any of

Subsidiary or any committee thereof, or to the knowledge of Global Payments,
to any director or officer of Global Payments or any Global Payments

which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Global
Payments Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties

(a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Global Payments and TSYS shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement, and Global Payments
shall prepare and file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included is a prospectus. Global Payments and TSYS shall
each use reasonable best efforts to make such filings within forty-five (45)
days after the date of this Agreement. Each of Global Payments and TSYS shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filings, and Global
Payments and TSYS shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement
to their respective shareholders. Global Payments shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and TSYS shall furnish all information concerning TSYS and
the holders of TSYS Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action.

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all necessary
actions, and do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, (ii)
make, or cause to be made, the registrations, declarations and filings (A)
required under the HSR Act and (B) required or advisable under any other
applicable Competition Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by

Agreement (and, in the case of any filings required under the HSR Act, no
later than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, unless
otherwise agreed by Global Payments and TSYS), (iii) prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all material permits, consents,

-40- 

    

 Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals, clearances and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities and (iv) seek to avoid or
prevent the initiation of any investigation, claim, action, suit, arbitration,
litigation or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ " shall mean the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and all regulatory
authorizations, consents, clearances, orders and approvals set forth on
Section 6.1(b) of the Global Payments Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objection
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in furtherance of the parties reasonable best efforts, each of
Global Payments and its Subsidiaries and TSYS and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to the extent required in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals or any necessary approvals of any other Governmental Entity required
for the transactions contemplated hereby or to avoid the consequences in
Section 6.1(b)(iv) or otherwise in connection with the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals required pursuant to any Competition Law, shall (1) propose,
negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any sale, leasing,
licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture or other encumbrance, or holding
separate, of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein (collectively, a " _Divestiture_ "); and (2)
take or agree to take any other action, agree or consent to, make any
concession in respect of, or permit or suffer to exist any condition or
requirement setting forth, any limitations or restrictions on freedom of
actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein (collectively, a " _Remedy_ "), _provided_ that (x) no such
Divestiture or Remedy shall be required if such Divestiture or Remedy,
individually or in the aggregate with any other Divestiture or Remedy, would
reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger, and
including the projected synergies expected to result therefrom, and (y)
neither party nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any of the
actions referred to above with respect to a Divestiture or Remedy unless the
effectiveness thereof is conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time.
Global Payments and TSYS agree to use reasonable best efforts to: (1) oppose
or defend against any investigation, claim, action, suit, arbitration,
litigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the
consummation of the Merger; or (2) overturn any regulatory order by any such
Governmental Entity to prevent consummation of the Merger, including
by defending any investigation, claim, action, suit, arbitration, litigation
or proceeding brought by any such Governmental Entity in order to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, overturned, terminated or appealed any order
that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Merger.

(d) If Global Payments or TSYS or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates receives a request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, then such party shall make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party (to the
extent permitted under applicable law), an appropriate response in substantial
compliance with such request. If Global Payments or TSYS receives a
formal request for additional information or documentary material from the
Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (" _Antitrust Division_ "), then Global Payments and
TSYS will substantially comply with such formal request as soon as reasonably
practicable, unless otherwise agreed between Global Payments and TSYS. Global
Payments and TSYS shall consult with each other in good faith prior to
agreeing, directly or indirectly, to extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or other applicable law or to any timing agreement with the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity.

 

(e) Each party shall promptly notify the other party of any communication it
or any of its affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, furnish the other party promptly with all
communications received from any Governmental Entity and permit the other
party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the other

 



-41- 

    

 partys comments to, any proposed communication, filing or submission by
such party to any Governmental Entity. The parties will coordinate and
reasonably cooperate with each other in exchanging information and providing
reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in writing in
connection with the foregoing or in connection with any filing or submission
to be made to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
materials exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.1 __ may be redacted or
withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns, and to remove references concerning the valuation of
Global Payments or TSYSs consideration of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or other competitively sensitive material; _provided_ ,
_further_ that the parties hereto may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any materials provided to the other pursuant to this Section 6.1 as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials. Global Payments and TSYS shall (to the extent permitted under
applicable law) consult with the other party in advance of any meeting,
discussion or teleconference with any Governmental Entity or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, with any other person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Entity or such other person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, discussions
and teleconferences. The parties shall discuss in advance the strategy and
timing for obtaining any clearances required or advisable under any
applicable law in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Global Payments shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
TSYS shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to
acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, or
take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating
to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or the
taking of any other action, would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, clearances or approvals of
any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
increase, in any material respect, the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk, in any material respect, of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) Global Payments and TSYS shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Global
Payments, TSYS or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_ _; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Global
Payments and TSYS, solely for purposes of furthering the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or integration planning relating thereto,
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives
of the other party, access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel, information technology systems, and records, and each
shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the
Effective Time the conversion or consolidation of systems and business
operations generally, and, during such period, each of Global Payments and
TSYS shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to
the other party all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Global Payments nor
TSYS nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be 

 



-42- 

    

 required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access
or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Global Payments or
TSYSs, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Global Payments and TSYS shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated May 10, 2019, between Global Payments and TSYS (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.3 _Shareholders_ __ _Approvals_. Each of Global Payments and TSYS shall
call a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Global Payments Meeting_ " and the
" _TSYS Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the S-4 is declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining (a) the
Requisite TSYS Vote, the Requisite Global Payments Vote and the Global
Payments Declassification Vote required in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger and (b) if so desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders in
connection with the approval of a merger agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby, and each of TSYS and Global Payments shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable and on the same date. Each of Global Payments and TSYS agrees (i)
to provide the other party with reasonably detailed periodic
updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including,
if requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the last ten (10)
days prior to the Global Payments Meeting or the TSYS Meeting, as applicable)
and (ii) to give written notice (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be
given via e-mail) to the other party one (1) day prior to, and on the date of,
the Global Payments Meeting or the TSYS Meeting, indicating whether, as of
such date, sufficient proxies representing the Requisite TSYS Vote or the
Requisite Global Payments Vote and the Global Payments Declassification Vote,
as applicable, have been obtained. Each of Global Payments and TSYS and
their respective Boards of Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the shareholders of Global Payments and TSYS, as applicable, the
Requisite Global Payments Vote and the Global Payments Declassification Vote
and the Requisite TSYS Vote, as applicable, including by communicating to the
respective shareholders of Global Payments and TSYS its recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that, in the case
of Global Payments, the shareholders of Global Payments approve this
Agreement (the " _Global Payments Board Recommendation_ "), and in the case of
TSYS, the shareholders of TSYS approve this Agreement (the " _TSYS Board
Recommendation_ "), and each of Global Payments and TSYS and their respective
Boards of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to the other party the Global Payments Board Recommendation, in
the case of Global Payments, or the TSYS Board Recommendation, in the case of
TSYS, (ii) fail to make the Global Payments Board Recommendation, in the case
of Global Payments, or the TSYS Board Recommendation, in the case of TSYS, in
the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an
Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve,
recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly and
without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
reaffirm the Global Payments Board Recommendation, in the case of Global
Payments, or the TSYS Board Recommendation, in the case of TSYS, in each case
within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as remains prior
to the Global Payments Meeting or the TSYS Meeting, as applicable) after an
Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by the other party to

 



-43- 

    

 do so, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the
foregoing a " _Recommendation Change_ "). However, subject to Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Global Payments or TSYS, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to make or continue to make the Global Payments Board
Recommendation or the TSYS Board Recommendation, as applicable, such Board of
Directors may, in the case of Global Payments, prior to the receipt of
the Requisite Global Payments Vote, and in the case of TSYS, prior to the
receipt of the Requisite TSYS Vote, submit this Agreement to its shareholders
without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such
Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation
to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment
or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ that such
Board of Directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless it (A)
gives the other party at least three (3) business days prior written notice
of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the
event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the
third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification
thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances)
and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account any amendment
or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would
nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the Global Payments
Board Recommendation or TSYS Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. Global Payments or TSYS
shall adjourn or postpone the Global Payments Meeting or the TSYS Meeting, as
the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Global Payments Common Stock or
TSYS Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting TSYS or Global Payments, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite TSYS Vote or the Requisite Global
Payments Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the Global
Payments Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of Global Payments at the Global Payments Meeting and (y) the
TSYS Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of TSYS at the TSYS Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve either Global Payments or TSYS of such obligation.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Global Payments and TSYS shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII
hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by TSYS or Global Payments or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Global Payments shall cause the shares of Global
Payments Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective
Time.

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_. 

(a) The Surviving Entity agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all
Global Payments Benefit Plans and TSYS Benefit Plans. In order to further an
orderly transition and integration, Global Payments and

 



-44- 

    

 TSYS shall cooperate in good faith in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing
the Global Payments Benefit Plans and TSYS Benefit Plans with a view towards
developing appropriate new benefit plans, or selecting the Global Payments
Benefit Plans or TSYS Benefit Plans, as applicable, that will apply with
respect to employees of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), which New Benefit
Plans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) treat similarly
situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account
all relevant factors, including duties, geographic location, tenure,
qualifications and abilities, and (ii) not discriminate between employees who
were covered by Global Payments Benefit Plans, on the one hand, and those
covered by TSYS Benefit Plans, on the other hand, at the Effective
Time. Until such time as the New Benefit Plans are determined and/or
established, the legacy TSYS employees will participate in TSYS Benefit Plans
and the legacy Global Payments employees will participate in Global Payments
Benefit Plans, in each case while employed by the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries and subject to the terms of such plans, and it is understood and
agreed that participation in New Benefit Plans may commence on different dates
following the Effective Time for different plans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from the Effective Time until the first anniversary thereof (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries shall
provide to each legacy TSYS employee, during the portion of the Continuation
Period that each such employee remains employed by the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries, (i) at least the same annual base salary or wage rate provided
to such employee by TSYS or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) at least the same cash bonus or other short-term cash
incentive opportunities provided to such employee by TSYS or its Subsidiaries
in respect of the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs. In addition,
any legacy TSYS employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated during
the Continuation Period and who does not have a contractual entitlement to
severance or termination benefits shall be eligible for severance on terms and
conditions no less favorable than the severance practices of Global Payments
as of the date hereof.

(b) With respect to any New Benefit Plans in which any employees of Global
Payments or TSYS (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall: (i) waive all preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New
Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Global Payments
Benefit Plan or TSYS Benefit Plan, as the case may be, (ii) provide each such
employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, prior to the
time such employee commenced participation in the New Benefit Plan) under a
Global Payments Benefit Plan or TSYS Benefit Plan (to the same extent that
such credit was given under the analogous Global Payments Benefit Plan or
TSYS Benefit Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Benefit Plans in which such employee first become
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with Global Payments or TSYS, as applicable, and
their respective Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities), for all purposes
in any New Benefit Plan in which such employees first become eligible to
participate after the Effective Time to the same extent that such service was
taken into account under the analogous Global Payments Benefit Plan or TSYS
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (C) for purposes of
any benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (D) to any benefit
plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

 

(c) If requested by Global Payments in writing delivered to TSYS not less than
ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of
TSYS (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take
such corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the Total
System Services, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the " _TSYS 401(k) Plan_ "),
effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time. If Global Payments requests that the TSYS
401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) TSYS shall provide Global Payments
with evidence that such plan has been terminated,

 



-45- 

    

 contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (the form and substance
of which shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by Global
Payments), not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Closing Date
and (ii) the continuing employees of TSYS and its Subsidiaries shall be
eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan
sponsored or maintained by Global Payments or one of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Global Payments 401(k) Plan_ "), it being agreed that there shall be no gap
in participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. Global Payments
and TSYS shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the TSYS 401(k) Plan and/or the Global Payments 401(k) Plan, to
permit the continuing employees of TSYS and its Subsidiaries who are then
actively employed to make rollover contributions to the Global Payments
401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash or notes (in the case of
loans) in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such
employee from the TSYS 401(k) Plan.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director or consultant of Global Payments or TSYS or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Entity, TSYS, Global Payments or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Entity, TSYS, Global Payments or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof
to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of Global Payments or TSYS or any of their Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify
any TSYS Benefit Plan, Global Payments Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular TSYS Benefit Plan,
Global Payments Benefit Plan, New Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time.
Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Global
Payments or TSYS or any of their Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_. 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall indemnify
and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in each case to the
extent (subject to applicable law) such persons are indemnified as of the date
of this Agreement by TSYS pursuant to the TSYS Articles, the TSYS Bylaws, the
governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of TSYS and
any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof, each
present and former director, officer or employee of TSYS and its Subsidiaries
(in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _TSYS
Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact
that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of TSYS or any of
its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of advancement of expenses, any TSYS
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such TSYS Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by TSYS ( _provided_ ,
that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Entity
shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in

 



-46- 

    

 excess of 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid as of the date
hereof by TSYS for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then
the Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which,
in the Surviving Entitys good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, Global Payments or TSYS, in consultation with the other party,
may (and at the request of Global Payments, TSYS shall use its reasonable best
efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail"
policy under TSYSs existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if
and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each TSYS
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or a majority of its assets to
any other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such
case, the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Global Payments, on
the one hand, and a Subsidiary of TSYS, on the other hand) or to vest the
Surviving Entity with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by the Surviving Entity.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Global Payments and TSYS shall each promptly advise
the other party of any effect, change, event, circumstance, condition,
occurrence or development known to it (i) that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would reasonably be expected
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained herein that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE VII; _provided_ , that any failure
to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach
shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the
failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give
such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance
with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available
to the party receiving such notice.

6.10 _Dividends_.

 

(a) After the date of this Agreement, each of Global Payments and TSYS shall
coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of
Global Payments Common Stock and TSYS Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties hereto
that holders of TSYS Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to
receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of TSYS
Common Stock and any shares of Global Payments Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

(b) Subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Entity,
it is the intention of the parties hereto that with respect to the first
dividend payment on Global Payments Common Stock following the Effective Time,
the dividend yield on Global Payments Common Stock will not be less than the
dividend yield on TSYS Common Stock as of the date of TSYSs most
recent quarterly dividend prior to the date hereof.

 



-47- 

    

6.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each party shall give the other party prompt
notice of any shareholder litigation against such party or its directors or
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
shall give the other party the opportunity to participate (at such others
partys expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. Each
party shall give the other the right to review and comment on all filings or
responses to be made by such party in connection with any such litigation, and
will in good faith take such comments into account. No party shall agree to
settle any such litigation without the other partys prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

6.12 _Corporate Governance_ _; Headquarters; Other Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Global Payments
shall take all actions necessary to adopt the Global Payments Bylaw Amendment
and the resolutions referenced therein and to effect the requirements

Effective Time and in accordance with the Global Payments Bylaw Amendment,

Time, of twelve (12) directors (i) six (6) of whom shall be persons designated
by Global Payments and (ii) six (6) of whom shall be persons designated by

(each a " _Global Payments Director_ "), which shall include Mr. Jeffrey S.
Sloan and Mr. William I Jacobs, and the six (6) directors designated by TSYS
shall be selected from among the current directors of TSYS as of the date
hereof (each a " _TSYS Director_ "), which shall include Mr. M. Troy Woods

(b) In accordance with the Global Payments Bylaw Amendment, Global Payments
shall take all actions necessary to cause the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Entity to have the following four standing committees as of the
Effective Time: (i) Audit Committee, (ii) Compensation Committee, (iii)

(collectively, the " _Committees_ "). The chairperson of each of the Audit
Committee and Compensation Committee as of the Effective Time shall be
designated by Global Payments from among the Global Payments Directors. The
chairperson of each of the Technology Committee and Governance and Nominating

TSYS Directors. The membership of the Committees shall be, as practicably as
possible, evenly split between Global Payments Directors and TSYS Directors.

 

(c) In accordance with the Global Payments Bylaw Amendment, effective as of
the Effective Time, Mr. M. Troy Woods shall serve as Chairman of the Board of

M. Troy Woods shall, in consultation with Mr. Jeffrey S. Sloan, Mr. William I
Jacobs and Mr. Kriss Cloninger III, make recommendations for approval by the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Entity effective from and after
the Effective Time, with respect to, among other matters that may pertain to
the Board of Directors of the Surviving Entity, the following: (i) the Global
Payments Directors and TSYS Directors to be appointed to the Committees, (ii)
the corporate governance guidelines, committee charters and other Board of
Directors procedures for the Surviving Entity to reflect best practices of
Global Payments, TSYS, and otherwise, and (iii) the overall functionality and
procedures for the conduct of business of the Board of Directors of the

(e) As of and from the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity will have dual

(f) As of and from the Effective Time, the name of the Surviving Entity will

Effective Time will continue to be conducted under the TSYS name.

 



-48- 

    

(g) In the event that the Global Payments Declassification Amendment is not
adopted as of the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate reasonably and
in good faith in an effort to apportion the Global Payments Directors, on the
one hand, and the TSYS Directors, on the other hand, as nearly evenly as is
practicably possible among the different classes of the Board of Directors of
the Surviving Entity and so that as nearly equal a number of Global Payments
Directors, on the one hand, and TSYS Directors, on the other hand, as is
practicably possible stand for election at the first annual meeting of
shareholders of the Surviving Entity following the Effective Time. The
provisions of this Section 6.12(g) shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
TSYS Director.

6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries respective executive officers and
directors, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries respective employees, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively and together with executive officers and directors, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in
any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or
participate in any discussions with any person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, except to notify a person that makes any inquiry or offer with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 6.13 or solely to clarify whether any such inquiry or offer
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet,
letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement
(whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.13)
in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the receipt of the Requisite Global Payments Vote, in the case of Global
Payments, or the Requisite TSYS Vote, in the case of TSYS, a party receives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, such party may, and
may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data
and participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person making
the Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in
good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take
such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that, prior to furnishing
any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant
to this sentence, such party shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less
favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate
with such party. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions
or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person
other than TSYS or Global Payments, as applicable, with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours)
advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), will
provide the other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition
Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in
connection with any such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep the
other party apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
on a current basis (but in no event more than once every twenty-four (24)
hours), including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms
thereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean,
with respect to Global Payments or TSYS, as applicable, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry
relating to, or any third-party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of the consolidated assets of a party and its Subsidiaries or

 



-49- 

    

 twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated
assets of the party, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party
beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class of equity
or voting securities of a party or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving a party or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the party.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a party or its Board of
Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.14 _Public Announcements_. TSYS and Global Payments agree that the initial
press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a release mutually agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, each of the
parties agrees that no public release or announcement or other public
statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (i) as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations
of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance or (ii) for such releases, announcements or statements that
are consistent with other such releases, announcement or statements made
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.14.

 

6.15 _Change of Method_. TSYS and Global Payments shall be empowered, upon
their mutual agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change
the method or structure of effecting the combination of TSYS and Global
Payments (including the provisions of ARTICLE I), if and to the extent they
both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided_
,  _however_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange
Ratio or the number of shares of Global Payments Common Stock received by
holders of TSYS Common Stock in exchange for each share of TSYS Common
Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of TSYSs shareholders or
Global Payments shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely
affect the Tax treatment of TSYS or Global Payments pursuant to this Agreement
or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The parties agree to
reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed
by both parties in accordance with Section 9.1.

6.16 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either TSYS or Global Payments shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite TSYS Vote or the Requisite Global Payments
Vote at the duly convened TSYS Meeting or Global Payments Meeting, as
applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties
shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a
restructuring of the transactions provided for herein (it being understood
that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material
terms, including the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued
to holders of the capital stock of TSYS as provided for in this Agreement or
the tax treatment of the Merger to such partys shareholders, in a manner
adverse to such party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this
Section 6.16) to its respective shareholders for approval.

6.17 _Takeover Statutes_. None of TSYS, Global Payments or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure

 



-50- 

    

 the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in
effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover
Statute.

6.18 _Financing and Indebtedness_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good
faith to mutually determine and use reasonable best efforts to implement any
necessary, appropriate or desirable arrangements, in anticipation of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, regarding each partys and its Subsidiaries credit agreements,
indentures or other documents governing or relating to indebtedness of the
parties and their Subsidiaries, including arrangements by way of amendments,
consents, redemption, payoff, new financing or otherwise with respect to
refinancing or retaining a partys or its Subsidiaries credit agreements or
senior notes and arrangements contemplated by that certain Bridge Commitment
Letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Global Payments, BofA Securities,
Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (together with the
fee letters related thereto, the " _Bridge Commitment Letter_ "), that
certain Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Global Payments,
BofA Securities, Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(together with the fee letters related thereto, the " _Permanent Financing
Commitment Letter_ ") and that certain Engagement Letter, dated as of the date
hereof, among Global Payments, BofA Securities, Inc., Bank of America, N.A.
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Engagement Letter_ " and, together with
the Bridge Commitment Letter and the Permanent Financing Commitment Letter,
the " _Commitment Letters_ ").

 

6.19 _Exemption from Liability_ _Under_ _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. TSYS and
Global Payments agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain TSYS Insiders, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that TSYS Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of TSYS Common
Stock into shares of Global Payments Common Stock in the Merger and the
conversion of TSYS Equity Awards into corresponding Global Payments Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree
to the provisions of this Section 6.19. TSYS shall deliver to Global Payments
in a reasonably timely fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate
information regarding those officers and directors of TSYS subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _TSYS
Insiders_ "), and the Board of Directors of Global Payments and of TSYS, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly
thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps
as may be required to cause (in the case of TSYS) any dispositions of TSYS
Common Stock or TSYS Equity Awards by the TSYS Insiders, and (in the case of
Global Payments) any acquisitions of Global Payments Common Stock or Global
Payments Equity Awards by any TSYS Insiders who, immediately following the
Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Entity subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

 

6.20 _Transition_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and in all cases subject to applicable law, upon the reasonable
request of the other party, each party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, during normal business hours, reasonably cooperate with the other party
and its Subsidiaries to facilitate the integration of the parties and
their respective businesses effective as of the Closing Date or such later
date as may be determined by the parties. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, and consistent
with the performance of their day-to-day operations and the continuous
operation of the parties and their Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices, and subject to any requirements
under applicable law, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its

 



-51- 

    

 Subsidiaries employees and officers to take reasonable actions and assist
the other party in performing all tasks, including providing assistance with
respect to conversion planning and customer communications and notices
(including joint communications and notices relating to anticipated account
changes or systems conversion), reasonably required to result in a successful
transition and integration at the Closing or such later date as may be
determined by the parties. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action under this Section 6.20 if such action would
unduly disrupt its business.

 

6.21 _Tax Matters_.

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and (b) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement will constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.
Each of Global Payments and TSYS shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

(b) If Global Payments Tax Counsel (as defined below) advises Global Payments
that it will not deliver a written opinion to Global Payments as required
under Section 7.2(c) or TSYS Tax Counsel (as defined below) advises TSYS that
it will not deliver a written opinion to TSYS as required under Section
7.3(c), Global Payments or TSYS, as the case may be, shall notify the other
party and use its reasonable best efforts to engage a law firm of recognized
national standing expert in the matters at issue and reasonably acceptable
to the other party (such selected firm, the " _Additional Tax Counsel_ ") to
serve as tax counsel for purposes of Section 7.2(c) or Section 7.3(c), as
applicable.

of such earlier date). All other representations and warranties of TSYS set
forth in this Agreement (read without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or
warranties but, in each case, after giving effect to the lead-in to ARTICLE
III) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this sentence, such representations and warranties shall
be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or failures of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, either individually
or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or
warranties, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on TSYS or the Surviving Entity. Global Payments shall have received a
certificate dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf of TSYS by the
Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of TSYS to the
foregoing effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of TSYS_. TSYS shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations, covenants and agreements required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and
Global Payments shall have received a certificate dated as of the Closing
Date and signed on behalf of TSYS by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief
Financial Officer of TSYS to such effect.

 

(c) _Federal Tax Opinion_. Global Payments shall have received the opinion of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (" _Global Payments Tax Counsel_ ") (or, if
Global Payments Tax Counsel advises that it will not deliver a written opinion
to Global Payments, a written opinion from the Additional Tax Counsel), in
customary form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Global Payments,
dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the
Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely
upon representations contained in certificates of officers of Global Payments
and TSYS, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

 

7.3 _Conditions to Obligations of_ _TSYS_. The obligation of TSYS to effect
the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by TSYS, at or
prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Global Payments set forth in Section 4.2(a) and Section 4.8(a) (in each case
after giving effect to the lead-in to ARTICLE IV) shall be true and correct
(other than, in the case of Section 4.2(a), for immaterial inaccuracies) in
each case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as
though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such earlier date), and the representations and warranties of Global
Payments set forth in Section 4.1(a), Section 4.3(a) and Section 4.7 (in each
case, after giving effect to the lead-in to ARTICLE IV) shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date).

 



-53- 

    

 All other representations and warranties of Global Payments set forth in
this Agreement (read without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or
warranties but, in each case, after giving effect to the lead-in to ARTICLE
IV) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this sentence, such representations and warranties shall
be deemed to be true and correct unless the failure or failures of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, either individually
or in the aggregate, and without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect set forth in such representations or
warranties, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Global Payments. TSYS shall have received a certificate dated as of
the Closing Date and signed on behalf of Global Payments by the Chief
Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of Global Payments to the
foregoing effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Global Payments_. Global Payments shall
have performed (i) in all respects the obligations, covenants and agreements
required to be performed by it (and within its control) pursuant to the first
two sentences of Section 6.12 at or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) in all
material respects all other obligations, covenants and agreements required to

on behalf of Global Payments by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief
Financial Officer of Global Payments to such effect.

(c) _Federal Tax Opinion_. TSYS shall have received the opinion of King and

will not deliver a written opinion to TSYS, a written opinion from the
Additional Tax Counsel), in customary form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to TSYS, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect
that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or
referred to in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion,
counsel may require and rely upon representations contained in certificates of
officers of Global Payments and TSYS, reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to such counsel.

 

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Requisite TSYS Vote or
the Requisite Global Payments Vote:

(a) by mutual written consent of Global Payments and TSYS;

 

(b) by either Global Payments or TSYS if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and
such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable order,
injunction, decree or other legal restraint or prohibition permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval or the
issuance of any such order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint or
prohibition shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the obligations, covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either Global Payments or TSYS if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before May 27, 2020 (the " _Initial Termination Date_ "
and, as it may be extended below, the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_
that, if, on the Initial Termination Date, any of the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals shall not have been obtained and all of the other conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those

 



-54- 

    

 conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof assuming such date were the
Closing Date), the Initial Termination Date may be extended by either party
to August 27, 2020 (the " _Extended Termination Date_ ") on written notice to
the other party on or by the Initial Termination Date; _provided_ _further_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the failure of the Closing to occur
by the Initial Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date, as
applicable, shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement or to extend the Termination Date, as applicable, to perform or
observe the obligations, covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein, such party shall not have such right to seek to terminate this
Agreement or to extend the Termination Date;

 

(d) by either Global Payments or TSYS ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall
cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of TSYS, in the
case of a termination by Global Payments, or Global Payments, in the case of a
termination by TSYS, which breach or failure to be true, either individually
or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of
such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), in the case of a termination by Global
Payments, or Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), in the case of a termination by
TSYS, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written
notice to TSYS, in the case of a termination by Global Payments, or Global
Payments, in the case of a termination by TSYS, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the
Termination Date);

 

(e) by TSYS, if (i) Global Payments or the Board of Directors of Global
Payments shall have made a Recommendation Change or (ii) Global Payments or
the Board of Directors of Global Payments shall have breached its obligations
under Section 6.3 or 6.13 in any material respect; or

 

(f) by Global Payments, if (i) TSYS or the Board of Directors of TSYS shall
have made a Recommendation Change or (ii) TSYS or the Board of Directors of
TSYS shall have breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.13 in any
material respect.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Global Payments or
TSYS as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, and none of Global Payments, TSYS, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any
liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) (Access to
Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.14 (Public Announcements), this
Section 8.2 and ARTICLE IX shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Global Payments nor TSYS shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of TSYS or shall have been made directly to the shareholders
of TSYS or any person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn at
least two (2) business days prior to the TSYS Meeting) an Acquisition
Proposal, in each case with respect to TSYS and (A) (x) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Global Payments or TSYS pursuant to Section
8.1(c) without the Requisite TSYS Vote having been obtained (and all other
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 were satisfied or were
capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Global Payments pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a
result of a willful breach, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12)
months after the date of such termination, TSYS enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred

 



-55- 

    

 to above), then TSYS shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such
definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay
Global Payments, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to
$860,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent
(50%)." As used in this Agreement, "willful breach" shall mean a material
breach of this Agreement that is the consequence of an act or omission by
a party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to
take such action would be a material breach of this Agreement.

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Global Payments
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then TSYS shall pay Global Payments, by wire
transfer of same-day funds, the Termination Fee within three (3) business days
of the date of termination.

 

(c) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or
senior management of Global Payments or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of Global Payments or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn at least two (2) business days prior to the
Global Payments Meeting) an Acquisition Proposal, in each case with respect to
Global Payments and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Global Payments or TSYS pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite
Global Payments Vote having been obtained (and all other conditions set forth
in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 were satisfied or were capable of being
satisfied prior to such termination) or (y) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by TSYS pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a willful breach,
and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Global Payments enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then Global
Payments shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay TSYS the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds; _provided_ , that for
purposes of this Section 8.2(c)(i), all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "twenty-five percent (25%)" shall instead refer to
"fifty percent (50%)."

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by TSYS pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then Global Payments shall pay TSYS, by wire transfer of
same-day funds, the Termination Fee within three (3) business days of the date
of termination.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted
herein, in no event shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee
more than once.

(e) Each of Global Payments and TSYS acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Global Payments or
TSYS, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for
the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay
the costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Global Payments
or TSYS, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ on the date on which such payment was required to be made for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full.

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 

9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

9.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of
law principles (except that matters relating to the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of Global Payments or TSYS shall be subject to the laws of
the State of Georgia).

 

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the
State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with
claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 9.5.

 

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 9.10.

 

9.11 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in
contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, Section 6.12(g) and Section
9.15, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to
herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver 

 



-59- 

    

 by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to
any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate
the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

9.15 _Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, but without in any way limiting the rights and claims of Global
Payments under and pursuant to any commitment letter or any definitive
agreement entered into by Global Payments with respect to any debt financing
arrangements in connection with the Merger, including the Commitment Letters
(the " _Financing Documents_ "), TSYS, on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries
and its controlled affiliates, hereby:

 

(a) agrees that any Proceeding involving the Financing Parties, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and shall
be brought and heard and determined exclusively in, any Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or, if that court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in the
City and County of New York, and any appellate court thereof and each party
hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court;

 

(b) agrees that any such Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State
of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that
would result in the application of the laws of another state), except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Financing Documents;

 



-60- 

    

(c) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its affiliates to bring or
support any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than any Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or,
if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court
located in the City and County of New York;

(d) agrees that service of process upon TSYS, its Subsidiaries or
its controlled affiliates in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice
