-2- ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

MERGER CONSIDERATION;

DETERMINATION OF WORKING CAPITAL

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of
capital stock of Merger Sub or the Company:

(i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, no
par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock
owned by the Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, or by Parent or
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be canceled automatically and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid for the Excluded
Shares.

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares), shall by virtue of the Merger be
converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms set forth herein,
the Total Per Share Merger Consideration, in cash, without interest.
All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted in the Merger
shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares (each a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
to those shares, other than the right to receive (i) following Closing, the
Per Share Closing Date Merger Consideration (less the Pro Forma Option,
Warrant and Note Proceed Amount as contemplated by Section 2.2(b)), upon
surrender of their Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 of this
Agreement and (ii) on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Per
Share Holdback Fund Amount, in each case subject to the adjustments provided
by Section 2.1(b).

(b) _Conversion of Capital Stock_. 

(i) _Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock_.

By the requisite vote of the Shareholders holding Series D Preferred Stock and
Series E Preferred Stock, as provided for in Section 6N of the Companys 2003
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, all issued and outstanding
shares of Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock shall have  



 

-3-  automatically converted into shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Series D and Series E Conversion_ ").

(ii) _Merger Consideration_.

(A) Subject to the establishment of the Holdback Fund, the Expenses Fund and
the Executive Fund, each of which will be delivered by Parent to the Escrow
Agent at the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Holdback Agreement, the total consideration payable by Parent pursuant to the
Merger is $150,000,000, (i) reduced by the amount, if any, that the Actual
Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing is less than $7,000,000
(the " _Target Net Working Capital_ ") as set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B)
below; (ii) increased by the Aggregate Option and Warrant Exercise Amount (to
the extent the Actual Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net
Working Capital); (iii) decreased by the amount of the Company Expenses; (iv)
decreased by the amount of the Agreed Tax Adjustments; and (v) decreased by
the amount of the Employee Bonus Payment.

(B) The Company shall, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, deliver to Parent a certificate setting forth a good faith determination
of the estimated net working capital of the Company at the Closing, determined
in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis with the 2005 Audit Financial
Statements and past practice (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "). At the
Closing, the Initial Merger Consideration to be paid upon proper surrender of
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be based upon the Estimated Net
Working Capital and shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section
2.1(b)(iii).

(C) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Actual Net Working Capital_ " means the Net Working Capital as determined
pursuant to the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet.

" _Aggregate Option and Warrant Exercise Amount_ " means any cash actually
received by the Company from (i) the exercise of Company Stock Options and
Company Warrants on or after May 19, 2006 and (ii) the repayment of any
Shareholder Notes on or after May 19, 2006.

" _Current Assets_ " shall mean the current assets of the Company excluding
the Aggregate Option and Warrant Exercise Amount as reflected on the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet.

" _Current Liabilities_ " shall mean the current liabilities of the Company
as reflected on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet.

" _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean an amount (positive or negative) equal
to the Current Assets minus the Current Liabilities, prior to any actual or
accrued (x) payment of a license fee to ePredix and (y) severance obligations
payable pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Schedule 5.1 hereto but excluding any
cash actually received from (i) the exercise of Company Stock Options and
Company Warrants from May 19, 2006 through the Closing Date and (ii) the
repayment of any Shareholder Notes from May 19, 2006 through the Closing
Date. 



 

-4- In connection with calculating Estimated Net Working Capital and Actual Net
Working Capital, the cash used by the Company to pay off debt (which is not
classified as a current liability) on or before the Closing Date will be added
back into the Current Assets.

(iii) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_.

(A) _Stock Split, Stock Dividend and Similar Events_. In addition to any other
adjustment under this Section 2.1(b)(iii), the Total Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Company
capital stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to shares of Company capital stock occurring (or for which a record
date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(B) _Working Capital Adjustment_. In addition to any other adjustment under
this Section 2.1(b)(iii), the Total Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
downward to reflect (i) if the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the
Target Net Working Capital, the amount, if any, by which the Actual Net
Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, or (ii) if
the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital, the amount, if any, by which the Actual Net Working Capital is less
than the Target Net Working Capital, in each case as follows:

 

(1) As soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days following
the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Securityholder Representative
an unaudited balance sheet of the Company (the " _Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") as of the close of business on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis with the
2005 Audited Financial Statements and past practice.

(2) Subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iv),
within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by the Securityholder
Representative of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, if a downward
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration is required after giving effect
to Sections 2.1(b)(iii)(B) and (C), Parent shall be entitled to a payment from
the Holdback Fund in an amount equal to such downward adjustment.

(C) _Readjustment in Certain Circumstances if Actual Net Working Capital
Exceeds Estimated Net Working Capital_. In addition to any other adjustment
under this Section 2.1(b)(iii), if the Estimated Net Working Capital is less
than the Target Net Working Capital such that the Initial Merger Consideration
is decreased pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.1(b)(ii)(B) (the "
_Closing Date Downward Working Capital Adjustment_ "), then (i) if the Actual
Net Working Capital exceeds both the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Target Net Working Capital, the Total Merger Consideration shall be
readjusted upward by the amount of the Closing Date Downward Working Capital
Adjustment; and (ii) if the Actual Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated
Net Working Capital but is less than the Target Net Working Capital, the
Total Merger Consideration shall be readjusted upward by the amount by which
the Actual Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital. In
such event, Parent shall deliver to the Paying Agent an aggregate amount equal
to the amounts  



 

-5-  provided in clauses (i) or (ii) above, if and as applicable. The Paying
Agent shall distribute such amount to the Securityholders in proportion
to their respective interest in the Holdback Fund.

(D) If the Actual Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net
Working Capital, in addition to any other adjustments provided by this
Section 2.1(b)(iii), Parent shall be reimbursed out of the Holdback Fund an
amount, if any, equal to the Aggregate Option and Warrant Exercise Amount paid
at Closing to the Securityholders as part of the Initial Merger
Consolidation.

(iv) _Dispute Resolution_.

(A) The Securityholder Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, that the Securityholder
Representative shall have notified Parent in writing of each disputed item,
specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute, within thirty (30) days of
the Securityholder Representatives receipt of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet. In the event of such a dispute, Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall attempt to reconcile their differences. If Parent and the
Securityholder Representative are unable to reach a resolution within twenty
(20) days after receipt by Parent of the Securityholder Representatives
written notice of dispute, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall
submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to an accounting firm to
be mutually agreed upon by the parties (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_
"), which shall, within thirty (30) days of such submission, determine and
report to the Securityholder Representative and Parent upon such remaining
disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Securityholders and Parent. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet that has not
been challenged, has been reconciled, or has been determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this subsection 2.1(b)(iv)(A) is
referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_." The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated equally
between Parent and the Securityholders.

(B) During the period of the Securityholder Representatives review of the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and of any dispute referred to in this
Section 2.1(b)(iv), Parent shall provide the Securityholder Representative,
any accounting firm designated by the Securityholder Representative (the "
_Shareholders  Accountant_") and any Independent Accounting Firm full access
to the books, records and facilities of the Surviving Corporation and shall
cooperate fully with the Securityholder Representative and Shareholders
Accountant and any Independent Accounting Firm, in each case to the extent
reasonably required by the Securityholder Representative, the Shareholders
Accountant and any Independent Accounting Firm in order to review the amounts
reflected in the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or to investigate the basis
for any such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such review and
investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operation of the Surviving Corporations business.

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a
bank or trust company, satisfactory to Parent in its reasonable discretion,
to act as the paying agent in the  



 

-6-  Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement
with the Paying Agent, the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory to
Parent in its reasonable discretion (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ").

(b) _Payment Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide funds to the Paying Agent in amounts necessary for the payment of the
Initial Merger Consideration, including the Option Consideration, the Warrant
Consideration and the Note Consideration, less the Pro Forma Option, Warrant
and Note Proceed Amount, upon surrender of Certificates and execution and
delivery of letters of transmittal. All funds provided to the Paying Agent are
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_."

(c) _Payment Procedures for Certificates_.

or "party in interest" (as defined in Section 3(18) of ERISA), has engaged in
any non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 4975 of

to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(k) There are no Legal Actions (other than routine claims for benefits)
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or relating
to any of the Company Benefits Plans. Except as set forth in Section 3.19(k)

nor has any received notice that it is the subject of examination by a
Governmental Entity nor has any been a participant in or taken action to

market value and no liquidation expenses nor any other charge will be imposed
on termination or liquidation of any such Company Benefit Plan.

to create any additional Company Benefit Plans or to modify any existing
Company Benefit Plan.

limits the Companys ability to amend or terminate the Plan except to the
extent so limited by Law or to protect accrued benefits.

Regulations"). No Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" has been materially modified (as determined under Proposed
Regulations) after October 3, 2004. No event has occurred that would be
treated  



 

-21-  by Code Section 409A(b) as a transfer of property for purposes of Code
Section 83\. No stock option or equity unit option granted under any
Company Benefit Plan has an exercise price that has been or may be less than
the fair market value of the underlying stock or equity units (as the case may
be) as of the date such option was granted or has any feature for the deferral
of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the

other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)

"disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section
280G(b) of the Code (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the
Code), in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Such vote shall establish the "disqualified individuals" right to the payment
or other compensation. In addition, before the vote is submitted to
Shareholders, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to holders
of voting shares of Company capital stock of all material facts concerning
all payments that, but for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to
a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that

thereunder. Parent and its counsel shall have the right to review and comment

Holdback Fund is made with respect to, or as a result of the inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty of the Company made in Section 3.34 hereof, the
Surviving Corporation shall, within two Business Days of the applicable
payment from the Holdback Fund, assign to the Securityholder Representative
all of the Surviving Corporations right, title and interest in and to all
accounts receivable related to or associated with the claimed Loss.

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.1 _Tax Indemnification_. The Securityholders shall be liable for,
and shall pay, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates,
pursuant to the terms, conditions and limitations of Article IX of this
Agreement, from and against any liability for Taxes due or payable by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable year or tax period (or
portion thereof) ending (or deemed pursuant to Section 8.2 to end) at or prior
to the Effective Time, including any liability for Taxes under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law) to the extent the liability for Taxes exceeds the liability
shown, excluding any deferred taxes on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for, and shall pay,
indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders and their Affiliates from and
against any and all liability for Taxes due or payable by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any taxable year or tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning (or deemed pursuant to Section 8.2 to begin) after the
Effective Time, including any liability for Taxes under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).

Section 8.2 _Taxable Period_.

(a) For the purposes of this Article VIII, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which
relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date will
(i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income
or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of
days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which will be the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the
case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal
to the amount that would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended at
the Effective Time.

(b) If the Company or any subsidiary is permitted but not required under
applicable foreign, state or local tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the
last day of a taxable period, Parent and the Company shall treat such day as
the last day of a taxable period. The Parent and the Company agree that they
will treat the Company and any Subsidiary as if they ceased to be a part of
the affiliated group of corporations of which the Company is a member within
the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code, and any comparable or similar
provision of state, local or foreign laws or regulations, as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.



 

-46- Section 8.3 _Tax Returns and Payments_. Parent will prepare, or cause the
Company to prepare, in a manner consistent with prior years (to the extent
permitted by Law), all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods beginning prior to
the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date. Parent will deliver
drafts of all such Tax Returns to the Securityholder Representative no later
than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax Returns are
required to be filed. If, within ten (10) Business Days following its receipt
of the draft Tax Returns, the Securityholder Representative does not dispute
any provision of the draft Tax Returns, the draft Tax Returns shall be final.
In the event that the Securityholder Representative has any dispute with
regard to the draft Tax Returns, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance
with the provisions for disputing the Net Working Capital set forth in Section
2.1(b)(iv); _provided_ , _however_ , that the relevant time periods shall be
adjusted to allow for completion and filing of the Tax Returns on a timely
basis. All income Tax Returns for the taxable period that ends on the Closing
Date and the taxable period that begins the day after the Closing Date shall
be prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76 (or any
similar state, local or foreign Law); _provided_ , _however_ , that no
election shall be made under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) (or any similar state,
local or foreign Law). Parent will timely file such Tax Returns and pay all
Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Securityholders shall be liable for any and all Taxes shown to be due on such
Tax Returns allocable to the Securityholders pursuant this Article VIII.
During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing
Returns_ ") in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries will deliver
drafts of all U.S. federal and state income Post-Signing Returns and all
other material Post-Signing Returns to Parent no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date on which such Post-Signing Returns are required to be
filed and fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such
Post-Signing Returns that are so filed. Without the prior written consent of
the Securityholder Representative which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall amend or allow to be
amended any Tax Return filed with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date if
such amendment could give rise to or increase the amount of any Shareholder
indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII or Article IX, except with respect to
the settlement of a Tax contest or audit.

Section 8.4 _Notification of Inquiry_. If Parent becomes aware of any
inquiry, examination or proceeding that could result in a determination with
respect to Taxes due or payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any taxable year or tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date which
is subject to indemnification by the Securityholders, Parent will promptly
notify the Securityholder Representative in writing.

Section 8.5 _Contest and Settlement_. The contest and/or settlement of any
issue raised in any inquiry, examination or proceeding that could result in a
determination with respect to Taxes due or payable for any taxable year or
period, shall be conducted as follows: (i) with respect to any such issue for
which Parent and its Affiliates are not entitled to indemnification hereunder,
Parent and its Affiliates shall have the sole right, at their expense, to
conduct the contest and/or settlement of such issue, and (ii) with respect to
any such issue for which Parent or any of its Affiliates may be entitled to
indemnification from the Securityholders hereunder,  



 

-47-  Parent shall conduct the contest and/or settlement of such issue; however,
Parent shall consult with the Securityholder Representative with respect to
the resolution of any issue, and not settle any such issue, or file any
amended Tax Return relating to such issue, without the consent of the
Securityholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Where consent to a settlement is withheld by the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to this Section 8.5, the Securityholder
Representative may initiate further proceedings at the expense of the
Securityholders provided that any liability of Parent shall not exceed the
liability that would have resulted had the Securityholder Representative not
withheld its consent.

Section 8.6 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Company as is
reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, for the
preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Parent and the
Securityholder Representative agree to use their reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any taxing authority, or customer of
the Company or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate a Tax that would otherwise be imposed with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and the Securityholder Representative
shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date
and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of
the statute of limitations for the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate without regard to extensions, except to the extent
notified by another party in writing of such extensions for the respective
Tax periods, or (ii) six years following the due date for such Tax Returns.

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Securityholder
Representative agrees, at the election of Parent, to treat all payments of
Option Consideration as allocable to the day following the Closing Date, so as
to make available to Parents consolidated group (as defined in Treas. Reg.
1.1502-1(h)) any deduction arising from such payments. The parties believe
that such an allocation is reasonable and intend to apply such allocation
consistently with the "Next Day Rule" as set forth in Treas. Reg.
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). To the extent possible, the Company and Securityholder
Representative agree to require all persons related to the Company under
Section 267 of the Code to treat such payments of Option Consideration as
having been made as described in this Section 8.6(b). The parties agree that
all payments of Option Consideration will be treated as made immediately after
the Effective Time.

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
and all transfer, gains, sales, use, stock transfer and stamp
taxes, recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement shall be paid by the Company or reserved for in the Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet.

Section 8.8 _No Recourse Against Customers_. In the event any Tax authority
shall assess any sales, goods and services or other similar Taxes, or in the
event Parent shall submit a  



 

-48-  claim for indemnification with respect to such Taxes hereunder, the
Securityholder Representative shall have no recourse against, and the
Securityholder Representative shall not seek reimbursement from, the
customers of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to which such Taxes
shall have been assessed.

Section 8.9 _Miscellaneous_. Parent shall treat all indemnification payments
made under this Article VIII and under other indemnity provisions of the
Holdback Agreement as adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration and such
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the Laws
of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise. During the period from the

and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against, and pay or
reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and such Affiliates (and such officers,
directors, shareholders and employees) for, any and all costs, amounts,

and employees) with respect to, as a result of or in connection with:

(a) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company made in or
pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or obligation of the Company
under this Agreement;

(c) any claim by a Shareholder or former Shareholder of the Company, or any
other person or entity, seeking to assert, or based upon; (i) ownership or
rights to ownership of any shares of stock of the Company; (i) any rights of a
Shareholder (other than the right to  



 

-49-  receive his her or its pro rata portion of the Total Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement or appraisal rights under the
applicable provisions of the OBCA), including any options, preemptive rights
or rights to notice or to vote; (iii) any rights under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company; or (iv) any claim that his, her or its
shares were wrongfully repurchased by the Company.

(d) certain Tax matters as set forth in Article VIII.

Section 9.2 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) An Indemnified Party shall notify the Securityholder Representative
promptly after becoming aware of any Losses that such Indemnified Party shall
have determined has given rise to, or is reasonably likely to give rise to, a
claim for indemnification hereunder (and if such matter arises out of a Legal
Action, such notice shall be given within ten (10) Business Days after such
Indemnified Party is given written notice of the claim or the commencement
of such Legal Action and shall describe the claim, the amount thereof (if
known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof). Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, the failure to so notify the Securityholder Representative hereunder
shall not release the Securityholders from their obligations under this
Article IX, except to the extent the Securityholders are actually prejudiced
by such failure to give prompt notice.

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Legal Action for which indemnification may be claimed
hereunder (at the expense of the Securityholders), and at its option shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense
(it being agreed in advance that counsel to the Company in this transaction
is acceptable to Parent); _provided_ that:

(i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Legal Action and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnified Party (other than any reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Securityholder
Representative assumes control of such defense, and except that the
Securityholders shall pay all of the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel if the Indemnified Party has been reasonably advised by its
counsel that use of the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party
and the Securityholders would present a conflict of interest);

(ii) the Securityholder Representative shall not be entitled to assume control
of such defense and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) the claim for indemnification relates
to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (B) the Legal Action primarily seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (C) the
Indemnified Party has been reasonably advised by its counsel that use of the
same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Securityholders
would present a conflict of interest; or (D) upon petition by the  



 

-50-  Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Securityholder
Representative failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defense such
Legal Action; and

(iii) if the Securityholder Representative shall control the defense of any
such Legal Action, the Securityholder Representative shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a
Legal Action or ceasing to defend such Legal Action if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief
will be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if such settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Legal Action, without
prejudice. A failure by the Indemnified Party to respond in writing to a
written request by the Securityholder Representative for consent for a period
of 15 Business Days or more shall be deemed consent by the Indemnified Party.

(c) After any Legal Action has been filed or initiated, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Securityholder Representative shall make available
to the other and its attorneys and accountants all pertinent information under
its control relating to such claim which is not confidential or proprietary in
nature or which is made available under the terms of a confidentiality
agreement or is delivered or obtained under appropriate protective orders
satisfactory to such party and the parties agree to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other in order to
facilitate the proper and adequate defense of any such claim.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnifiable Losses
made pursuant to this Article IX shall be net of any insurance or other
recoveries actually received (but without reduction for any "deductible,"
"self insurance retention" or any similar risk retention expense in respect
of applicable insurance policies or other expenses incurred in connection with
such recovery) by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with
the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. 

(e) All indemnification obligations of the Securityholders under this Article
IX shall be effected through a payment to Parent from the Holdback Fund.

Section 9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) The indemnification obligations of the Securityholders hereunder shall
survive until the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Indemnification Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each
case, all such obligations shall survive with respect to, and to the extent
of, any claim for which notice shall have been delivered to
the Securityholder Representative prior to the Indemnification Expiration
Date until such claim shall have been finally resolved. After the Closing, the
sole and exclusive remedies for any breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made in or pursuant to this
Agreement or the Holdback Agreement shall be pursuant to Articles VIII and IX.
Without limiting the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent Parent from
bringing a common law action for fraud against any Person whose own fraud has
caused Parent to incur Losses or limit the Losses recoverable by Parent in
such common law action.



 

-51- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IX,
the Securityholders shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for
indemnification as a result of any claim in respect of any Losses incurred by
any Indemnified Party under Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(c) unless the
aggregate dollar amount of all claims for Losses equals or exceeds $250,000,
at such time the total of such Losses, including but not limited to, the
Losses that are below $250,000 will be deducted from the Holdback Fund.

(c) The maximum aggregate indemnification amount that shall be paid by the
Securityholders to the Indemnified Parties under this Article IX shall be the
full amount of the Holdback Fund.

(d) In all cases in which an Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified
in accordance with this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall be under a
duty to take commercially reasonable measures to mitigate all losses.

(e) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled under this Agreement to
multiple recovery for the same Losses. If an Indemnified Party receives any
amount under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged
to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment
having been received but prior to the termination and winding up of the
Holdback Fund in accordance with the Holdback Agreement, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Holdback Fund for any
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount. Nothing in this Section 9.3 shall be construed to require any party
hereto to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage or file a claim under any
insurance policy.

(f) Parent and Merger Sub each agree that Losses related to any event,
transaction, circumstance or liability, whether contingent or accrued, for
which a reserve has been established as a Current Liability on the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not give rise to a right of indemnification
hereunder, but only up to the amount of such reserve as set forth on the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet.

Representative shall have the full power, authority and right to perform, do

make and carry out decisions under this Agreement and the Holdback Agreement
on behalf of each Securityholder and to sign documents and make filings on
behalf of each Securityholder as if such Securityholder had itself signed or
filed such document, and (ii) retain attorneys, accountants, and other
professional service providers to assist and advise it with respect to its
duties hereunder. If specifically requested by Securityholders who have
the right to receive a majority of the Total Merger Consideration (including
the Option Consideration, Warrant Consideration and Note Consideration) paid
to the Securityholders, the Securityholder Representative shall also have the
power to amend, modify or waive any agreement (including this Agreement) in
the name of each Securityholder as if such Securityholder had itself amended,
modified or waived such agreement (and regardless of whether the particular
Securityholder in fact requested that the Securityholder Representative enter
into such amendment, modification or waiver).

Section 10.3 _Rights of Securityholder Representative_. The Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Securityholder, Parent or
Merger Sub, or any other evidence deemed by the Securityholder Representative
to be reliable. The Securityholder Representative shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing or take any action under this Agreement and the Holdback
Agreement unless it shall have received such advice or concurrence of the
Securityholders as it deems appropriate or unless it shall have been expressly
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Securityholders severally and pro rata
against any and all liability and expense that it may incur by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Securityholder
Representative shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining
from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of
Securityholders who have a right to receive a majority of the Total Merger

Note Consideration) paid to the Securityholders, and such request, and any
such action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto, shall be binding upon
all of the Securityholders.

Section 10.4 _Liability of Securityholder Representative_. The
Securityholder Representative shall not be liable for any error of judgment,
or any action taken or omitted to be taken hereunder except in the case of its
intentional wrongdoing for personal benefit. The Securityholder Representative

protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by it in good faith in
accordance with the advice of counsel.

Section 10.5 _Costs and Expenses_. The Securityholder Representative shall not
be paid any fee for services to be rendered hereunder. All reasonable fees and
expenses incurred by the Securityholder Representative in performing its
duties hereunder (including under Sections 2.1(b), Article VIII and Article

the Securityholders from the Expenses Fund.



 

-53- Section 10.6 _Indemnification_. The Securityholders severally and pro rata
shall indemnify and hold the Securityholder Representative harmless against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including
reasonable costs of investigation, attorneys fees, and disbursements that may
be imposed on the Securityholder Representative or incurred by the
Securityholder Representative in connection with the performance of its duties
under this Agreement, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or
the Holdback Agreement or involving their subject matter, unless such loss,
liability, claim or expense shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be a result of the Securityholder Representatives intentional
wrongdoing for personal benefit. Except in the case of fraud by
a Securityholder, each Securityholders liability under this Section 10.6
shall not exceed the portion of the Total Merger Consideration (including the
Option Consideration, Warrant Consideration or Note Consideration) received by
such Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Securityholder
Representative be liable to the Securityholders for special, indirect or
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including lost profits),
even if the Securityholder Representative has been advised of the likelihood
of such damages and regardless of the form of action.

Section 10.7 _Resignation_. The Securityholder Representative may resign at
any time. The Securityholder Representative may be removed at any time by a
writing signed by Securityholders who have the right to receive a majority of
the Total Merger Consideration (including the Option Consideration, Warrant
Consideration and Note Consideration) paid to the Securityholders. If the
Securityholder Representative or any successor shall resign, be so removed,
or become unable to act as the Securityholder Representative, a replacement
shall promptly be appointed by a writing signed by Securityholders who have
the right to receive a majority of the Total Merger Consideration (including
the Option Consideration, Warrant Consideration and Note Consideration) paid
to the Securityholders. Parent shall promptly be notified of such resignation,
removal or appointment.

Section 10.8 _Reliance_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on
the actions taken by the Securityholder Representative, and that each action
taken by the Securityholder Representative shall be binding on each of the
Securityholders as if such action had been performed by such Securityholder.
The Securityholders severally and pro rata shall indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and Merger Sub from and against any losses that Parent or Merger Sub
may suffer, sustain or become subject to as the result of any claim by any of
the Securityholders that an action taken by the Securityholder Representative
purportedly on behalf of the Securityholders pursuant to the authorization in
this Article X is not binding on or enforceable against any of the
Securityholders.

Section 10.9 _Negotiation_. In the event that Parent brings a claim under
Article VIII or Article IX hereof or the Holdback Agreement, and the
Securityholder Representative disputes such claim (a "Dispute"), Parent and
the Securityholder Representative shall negotiate with each other in good
faith to resolve the Dispute for a period of thirty (30) days from the date on
which Parent notified the Securityholder Representative of such Dispute prior
to taking any action pursuant to this Agreement or the Holdback Agreement.
