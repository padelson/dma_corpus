identified in the Notice of Objection shall be deemed to be agreed to by the
Shareholders Representative and will be final and binding upon all of the
parties to this Agreement. If the Shareholders Representative fails to
deliver a Notice of Objection within the Acceptance Period, the Post-Closing
Statement and the amounts set forth therein shall be deemed to have been
accepted by the Shareholders Representative and shall be binding upon all of
the parties to this Agreement for all purposes hereof. If the Shareholders
Representative delivers a Notice of Objection to Parent within the Acceptance
Period, the Shareholders Representative and Parent shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve the Shareholders Representatives objections within the
twenty (20) day period following the delivery of the Notice of Objection.

Objection is less than the aggregate amount claimed to be due Parent in the

Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Escrow Account an amount equal to
such excess to the Shareholders Representative.

binding upon each party hereto and the decision of the Arbitrator shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable
and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction
thereover.

responsible for that fraction of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator equal
to (1) the absolute value of the difference between the Shareholders
Representatives aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Items and the
Arbitrators final determination with respect to the Disputed Items over (2)
the absolute value of the difference between the Shareholders
Representatives aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Items and
Parents aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Items, and Parent
shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and costs.

Section 7.09 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers
and directors of the Company (when acting in such capacity) (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and together, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all
losses, costs, expenses, claims, damages, judgments or liabilities
incurred in connection with, any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer or director of the Company pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring before or at the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed before, at or after, the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ ") to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL; provided,
however, that such indemnification will be provided only to the extent any
directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company or its
Subsidiaries does not provide coverage and actual payment thereunder with
respect to the matters that would otherwise be subject to indemnification
hereunder. Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of
any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (each, a " _Claim_ "), existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or the
Companys by-laws on the date hereof or pursuant to other agreements,
or certificates of incorporation or bylaws or similar documents of any
Subsidiaries of the Company, as in effect as of the date hereof, with respect
to matters occurring through the Effective Time, will survive the Merger and
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for not less than six
years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to
matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time; provided, however, that
(i) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for such insurance in excess of two times the last annual premium paid prior
to the date hereof, and (ii) that if such insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use its
reasonable efforts to obtain as much directors and officers liability
coverage as can be obtained for such amount.

 

(c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.09_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.09_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each such Person entitled to indemnification,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

Section 10.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when all such counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other parties. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any other agreements
contemplated hereby, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies.

 

Section 10.05 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action of all the
parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, but no amendment shall be made which the DGCL requires further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without such further approval.

each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) to the extent

warranties contained in this Agreement by any other party or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable
party, or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 Section 10.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the agreements,
instruments and documents contemplated hereby shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflict of laws thereof.

 

Section 10.08 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (in whole or
in part) by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. No
assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

shall have authority to bind each such Shareholder, and Parent and Merger Sub

and survives the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any
Shareholder and (ii) survives the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) _Liability_. The Shareholders Representative will not be liable to any
Shareholder for any act done or omitted under this Agreement as the
Shareholders Representative while acting in good faith, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.

 

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance; Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage may occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that any breach of this Agreement would not be
adequately compensated by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court identified in _Section

Company to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be

substitution for any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or
in equity.

property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,

execution of judgment or otherwise) and (z) to the fullest extent permitted by
the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this
Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section 10.02_ and agrees that service of any

any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

Section 10.12 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

Section 10.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or

 



50 ##### Table of Contents

  

 unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained
herein, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.14 _Legal Representation_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company

acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the Shareholder Group
and their counsel, including Winston and Strawn LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
