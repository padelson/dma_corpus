Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with such Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock, Cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid in accordance with this Agreement (such Cash being hereinafter referred to as 

   ##### 

  

 

the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying

 (b) Promptly, but in any event within 5 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.06(a)_ a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal.

 (c) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, such amount or amounts as it reasonably believes is the minimum it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and properly paid to the relevant Government Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) or Company Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (d) At any time following the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the 

   ##### 

  

 

Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock
for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share of Company
Common Stock to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Law. 

   

 (e) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. 

  

 (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)_.

No Company Subsidiary is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

since December 31, 2009, which would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect
or (ii) in connection with the Transactions and as contemplated by this
Agreement. 

   

 (d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Company Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding financial disclosures.

settlement agreement or similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge

 SECTION 6.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.(a) The Company shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal and shall seek to have returned to the Company (or destroyed) any confidential information that has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations. From the date hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives retained by it or any Company Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage (including by way of furnishing information which has not been previously publicly disseminated), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, that if, following the receipt of a Takeover Proposal that is or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal that in either case was unsolicited and made after the date hereof in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this _Section 6.04_, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal and subject to compliance with _Section 6.04(c)_, (A) request information from the party making such Takeover Proposal for the purpose of the Company Board informing itself about the Takeover Proposal that has been made and the party that made it, (B) furnish information with respect to the Company to the party making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, provided, that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company advises Parent of all such nonpublic information delivered to such person (not previously provided or made available to Parent) promptly after its delivery to the requesting party, and (C) participate in negotiations with such party regarding such Takeover Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any executive officer, director or investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.04(a)_ by the Company.

   ##### 

  

 

referred to in clause (B) of the proviso to _Section 6.04(a)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company Board determines
in good faith, in response to a Takeover Proposal (that was not solicited in
breach of _Section 6.04(a)_) that constitutes a Superior Proposal, which was
made after the date hereof in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach
of this Agreement, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, the Company Board may (subject to compliance with this sentence and to
compliance with _Sections 6.04(a)_ and  _6.04(c)_ ) (x) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (y) cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition
Agreement, or (z) postpone or adjourn the Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that any actions described in clause (x), (y) or (z) may be taken
only at a time that is after the second business day following Parents
receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company
Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such
Superior Proposal and providing notice of the determination of the Company
Board of what actions described in clause (x), (y) or (z) the Company Board
has determined to take, and provided further, that the action described in
clause (y) may be taken only upon compliance by the Company with
_Section 8.01 (d)(ii)_ and _Section 8.03_. In addition, and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may also make
an Adverse Recommendation Change as contemplated by clause (i) of the
definition of "Adverse Recommendation Change" , if it determines in good
faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that a failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided that
the Company has given Parent two business days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons
for such action. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section 6.04(a)_ and  _6.04(b)_ , the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for confidential information in connection with a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or the Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such request or Takeover Proposal and shall keep Parent promptly informed of all developments that could lead to the Company Board making an Adverse Recommendation Change or exercising any of its other rights under _Section 6.04_(a) or (b). 

  

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.04_ or _Section 6.10_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as in accordance with _Section 6.04(b)_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and further provided that in no event shall any "stop", "look" and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-1(f) under the Exchange Act be deemed to deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or violate _Section 6.04_.

    ##### 

 

  

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction) of 10% or
more of the consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries)
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 10% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, other than the
Transactions. 

   

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was not solicited in violation of _Section 6.04(a)_ from any person for a direct or indirect acquisition or purchase (pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction) of 50% or more of the consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 50% or more of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 50% or more of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock, (other than the Transactions) which, considering all relevant factors (including whether financing for such Takeover Proposal is fully committed or reasonably likely to be obtained and whether such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to be consummated) the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel), is more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 6.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former officers, employees or directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including without limitation, payment of incentive bonuses thereunder for the calendar year ending December 31, 2010. In addition, Parent shall grant employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary credit for all periods of employment with the Company and any Company Subsidiary for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Company Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits. 

  

 SECTION 6.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or judgments, including any amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the Surviving Corporation (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection with any Action based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring at or prior to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the
Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
The Surviving Corporation will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party
in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent
permitted by Law to advance such expenses upon receipt of an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined in accordance with
applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to indemnification. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Action
is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time) or an Indemnified Party is required to be a witness in any
Action: (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them
and reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation; (ii) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; and
(iii) the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement of any Action
effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this _Section 6.06_, upon learning of any such Action shall notify the
Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify the Surviving
Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any liability
which it may have under this  _Section 6.06_ except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation), and shall deliver
to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking of the kind described above. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to
local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction if reasonably required) to
represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the same provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification contained in Article SIXTH of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and Article VI of the By-Laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law, and then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law. 

  

 (c) The Company shall purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or carriers with comparable credit ratings, as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time and covering the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company pay more than 250% of the current annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.06(c)_ for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the Maximum Amount. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall be construed to waive or impair the rights of any director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to make a claim under any directors and officers liability insurance that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.06_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such insurance. 

  

 SECTION 6.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which reasonably could be expected to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (b) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any material covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, (c) any other development that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect, and (d) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.07_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 SECTION 6.08 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days of the date hereof) its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws with respect to the Merger and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger, including, using its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities (including the approval of the Delaware Insurance Department, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Minnesota Department of Commerce and the Arkansas Insurance Department, (collectively, the " _Form A Approvals_")) and parties to contracts with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Merger and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger; provided that neither Merger Sub nor Parent will be required by this _Section 6.08_ to take any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other arrangements, that (A) requires the divestiture of any assets of any of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or (B) limits Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parents or its affiliates other assets or businesses.

hereof and to respond promptly to any request by any Governmental Authority
for any additional information and documentary material in connection
therewith. Parent shall give the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Form A Approvals, and all amendments
or supplements thereto prior to their being filed or submitted. Each of
Parent and the Company shall promptly forward to the other all notices,
inquiries and other written communications received by it from any

Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to take all such
action. Subject to Section 6.04 and the termination rights provided in Article

The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

 SECTION 9.02 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially 

   ##### 

  

 

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto agree
that the court making such determination will have the power to limit the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision and this Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

   

 SECTION 9.03 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes, except as set forth in _Section 6.03(b_) and  _Section 6.11_, all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise), except that either of Parent and Merger Sub may (in its sole discretion) assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. 

  

 SECTION 9.04 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person (including any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 6.06_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons). 

  

 SECTION 9.05 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof on a timely basis and that the parties, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights, obligations and remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and, in addition to any other rights, obligations and remedies otherwise available at law or in equity. A partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ shall not (unless the party has exercised such right to terminate) negate any right such party may have to specific performance under this  _Section 9.05_. 

  

 SECTION 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State.

action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in any such action or proceeding in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 9.01_ of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to

 SECTION 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.
