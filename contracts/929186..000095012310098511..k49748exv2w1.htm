either case which adjustment or change would constitute a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing
or to have such power, authority or governmental approvals would not, individually or in the

otherwise prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing its obligations under this Agreement.

Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to

or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination
will have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term

substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent

Parent and Merger Sub may (in its sole discretion) assign all or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve
the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations.
