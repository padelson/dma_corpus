and duties of Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub II shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity, and the Surviving Entity shall

1.7 Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations.

(a) Effect on Company Capital Stock.

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company or the Company
Stockholders, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 1.9 and throughout this Agreement, including the provisions set forth
in Section 4.2(f) and Article VII hereof, each share of Company Capital Stock
(other than any Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
upon the due surrender of duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner set
forth in Section 1.9(b), (i) at the Closing, in accordance with Section 1.9,
(A) the Per Share Consideration (without interest thereon), minus (B) the Per
Share Escrow Amount, minus (C) the Per Share Expense Fund Amount, (ii) any
disbursements of Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares required to be made from the
Escrow Fund with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock to the former
holder thereof (based on such holder's Pro Rata Share of the released amount),
without interest in accordance with Section 7.4, (iii) any disbursements of
cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock required to be made in connection
with the Post-Closing Excess Amount (if any) with respect to such share of
Company Capital Stock to the former holder thereof (based on such holder's Pro
Rata Share of the Post-Closing Excess Amount), without interest, in accordance
with Section 1.15(e) and (iv) any cash disbursements required to be made from
the Expense Fund Account with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock
to the former holder thereof (based on such holder's Pro Rata Share of the
released amount), without interest, in accordance with Section 7.6(c). Each
share of Parent Common Stock issuable in the First Merger, or any other
securities issued in respect of such shares upon any stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or similar event, shall be
book-entry security entitlements.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing Per Share Amount payable in
respect of the shares of a particular series of Company Preferred Stock in
accordance with Section 1.7(a)(i) is less than the Per Share Liquidation
Preference for such series (with the shares of Parent Common Stock valued at
the Parent Common Stock Closing Price for purposes of this Section
1.7(a)(ii)), then the portion of the Total Merger Consideration payable with
respect to each such share of Company Preferred Stock will be an amount equal
to the Per Share Liquidation Preference applicable to such share of Company
Preferred Stock, and the payments to the other Company Securityholders with
respect to their shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company
Warrant will be appropriately adjusted hereunder to take into account such
payments and to provide for the payment of the remaining portion of the Total
Merger Consideration (if any) in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and the terms of this Agreement. Any payments made in respect of
any such Per Share Liquidation Preference shall be in the same relative
proportion of cash and stock payable to the other Accredited Investors (if the holder is an Accredited Investor) or Unaccredited Investors
(if the holder is an Unaccredited Investor) with respect to their shares of
Company Capital Stock, with appropriate adjustments to take into account the
fact that the amount per share being paid will be different between the
affected series and the other series and classes of Company Capital Stock. The
foregoing shall not limit in any way the obligations of any holder of any such
affected series of Company Preferred Stock as a Company Indemnitor hereunder,
other than the obligation to contribute to the Escrow Fund; provided that any
such holder shall still contribute to the Expense Fund. All of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to be modified to give effect to
the foregoing treatment mutatis mutandis (including the Pro Rata Share
definition and other applicable defined terms), and the Allocation Schedule
will be prepared to reflect the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall this Section 1.7(a)(ii) increase (A) the Total Merger
Consideration that would otherwise be payable by Parent pursuant to this
Agreement, (B) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock that
would otherwise be issuable by Parent to holders of Company Securities
pursuant to this Agreement or (C) the aggregate amount of the cash that would
otherwise be payable by Parent to holders of Company Securities pursuant to
this Agreement.

(b) Treatment of Company Options.

(i) Vested Company Options. No Vested Company Options shall be assumed or
continued by Parent or the Company in connection with the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Vested Company Option outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock subject thereto, (A) an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (1) the Per Share Unaccredited Cash Amount for each share of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of such Vested Company Option, minus
(2) an amount in cash equal to the per share exercise price of such Vested
Company Option, minus (3) the Per Share Escrow Amount, minus (4) the Per Share
Expense Fund Amount, (B) any disbursements of Escrow Cash required to be made
from the Escrow Fund with respect to such Vested Company Option to the former
holder thereof (based on such holder's Pro Rata Share of the released amount),
without interest in accordance with Section 7.4,(C) any cash disbursements
required to be made in connection with the Post-Closing Excess Amount (if any)
with respect to such Vested Company Option to the former holder thereof (based
on such holder's Pro Rata Share of the Post-Closing Excess Amount), without
interest, in accordance with Section 1.15(e), and (D) any cash disbursements
required to be made from the Expense Fund Account with respect to such Vested
Company Option to the former holder thereof (based on such holder's Pro Rata
Share of the released amount), without interest, in accordance with Section
7.6(c). Such payment in respect of any Vested Company Options that are
Employee Options shall be made to the holders of Employee Options through
Parent's or the Surviving Entity's payroll processing system in accordance
with standard payroll practices net of applicable Tax withholding and
deductions, and such payment in respect of any Vested Company Options that are
Non-Employee Options, shall be paid to the Paying Agent for further payment to
such the holders of such Non-Employee Options; provided that, as a condition
to payment of any amount owed to the holders of Non-Employee Options, each
such holder of Non-Employee Options must have first delivered to the Paying
Agent or Parent, as applicable, a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and
a properly completed IRS Form W-9, or the appropriate version of IRS Form W-8,
as applicable. For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of
consideration payable to each Company Vested Optionholder in respect of all of
such holder's Vested Company Options pursuant to this Section 1.7(b)(i), (1)
the consideration payable in respect of all Vested Company Options held by
such Company Vested Optionholder shall be aggregated and (2) the amount of cash to be paid
to each such Company Vested Optionholder after such aggregation shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) Unvested Company Options (Continuing Employees). At the Effective Time,
each Unvested Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a Continuing Employee shall, by virtue of the
Mergers and without any further action by Parent, Merger Subs, the Company, or
the holder of such Unvested Company Option, be assumed by Parent and converted
into, or terminated and substituted with, a stock option of Parent that
represents the right to acquire a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock, equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange
Ratio (each, a "Converted Option"); provided, that any fractional share
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
share. Following the Effective Time, each Converted Option shall continue to
be governed by the same material terms and conditions, including the vesting
schedule, as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to the
Unvested Company Option from which it was converted or for which it is a
substitute, in all cases subject to restrictions related to the issuance of
shares under applicable Law. The exercise price of each Converted Option shall
be equal to (x) the exercise price of the Unvested Company Option from which
it was converted or for which it is a substitute, divided by (y) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent (the "Converted Option Exercise
Price"). It is the intention of the parties that each Converted Option shall
qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option (as defined
in Section 422 of the Code) to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the
Code and to the extent such corresponding Company Option qualified as an
incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time, and that the adjustments
in this Section 1.7(b)(ii) be performed in a manner that complies with or is
exempt from Section 409A of the Code.

(iii) Unvested Company Options (Non-Continuing Employees). Each Unvested
Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a Person who is not a Continuing Employee shall be cancelled
and terminated without consideration upon the Effective Time in accordance
with the Company Equity Plan.

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the prior review and approval
of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions anticipated by this Section 1.7(b) under the Company Equity Plan
and any Contract applicable to any Company Option (whether written or oral,
formal or informal), including delivering all required notices in connection
with the treatment of Company Options in accordance with this Section 1.7(b).
The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company Equity
Plan prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Company will not at the
Effective Time be bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock units, warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any
Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof other
than the payments provided for under this Agreement.

(v) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted Options. To
the extent Parent elects to assume the Company Equity Plan in connection with
its assumption of the Converted Options pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(ii), Parent with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form)
relating to the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of
Converted Options as promptly as is practical, but in any event no later than
(i) five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date.

(c) Treatment of Company Warrant. The Company Warrant shall not be assumed or
continued by Parent or the Company in connection with the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Warrant shall be cancelled and extinguished and, subject to the
execution and delivery by the Company Warrantholder of the Warrant
Cancellation Agreement at or prior to the Closing, be converted automatically
into the right to receive with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
subject thereto, (i) at the Closing, subject to Section 1.9, (A) an amount of
cash equal to (1) the Per Share Accredited Cash Consideration, minus (2) an
amount in cash equal to the per share exercise price of the Company Warrant,
minus (3) the Per Share Escrow Amount, minus (4) the Per Share Expense Fund
Amount and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Per
Share Accredited Stock Consideration, (ii) any disbursements of Escrow Cash
and Escrow Shares required to be made from the Escrow Fund with respect to
such Company Warrant to the Company Warrantholder thereof (based on the
Company Warrantholder's Pro Rata Share of the released amount), without
interest, in accordance with Section 7.4, (iii) any disbursements of cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock required to be made in connection with the Post-
Closing Excess Amount (if any) with respect to the Company Warrant to the
Company Warrantholder (based on the Company Warrantholder's Pro Rata Share of
the released amount), without interest, in accordance with Section 1.15(e) and
(iv) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Expense Fund Account
with respect to such Company Warrant to the Company Warrantholder (based on
the Company Warrantholder's Pro Rata Share of the released amount), without
interest, in accordance with Section 7.6(c).

(d) Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Subs.

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub I issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) At the Second Effective Time, each share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one (1) validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable common unit of the Surviving Entity.

(e) Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First Merger, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company or
Parent (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or
Parent) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or the right to receive any
consideration therefor (such shares, the "Cancelled Shares").

1.8 Payments.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in no event
later than one (1) Business Day following the Closing, Parent shall transfer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent for
exchange in accordance with this Article I, the cash portion of the Total Merger Consideration payable at the Closing to (i) the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.7(a) in exchange for shares of Company
Capital Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
the Company Vested Optionholders who hold Non-Employee Options pursuant to
Section 1.7(b)(i) in exchange for such Vested Company Options outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) the Company Warrantholder
pursuant to Section 1.7(c) in exchange for the Company Warrant outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding, in each case, the
portion of the Escrow Fund and Expense Fund applicable to such payments.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in no event
later than one (1) Business Day following the Closing, Parent, or the Paying

Consideration payable at Closing in respect of the Vested Company Options that
are Employee Options pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i) in exchange for such
Employee Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
excluding, in each case, the portion of the Escrow Fund and Expense Fund
applicable to such payments.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to promptly (but in no event later
than the second regular payroll cycle following the Closing) pay, through the
Surviving Entity's payroll processing system in accordance with standard
payroll practices, to each Company Vested Optionholder who holds Employee
Options that portion of the Total Merger Consideration payable at Closing to
such holder solely in respect of such Employee Options pursuant to Section
1.7(b)(i) as set forth opposite such holder's name in the Allocation Schedule
(such amount, net of applicable Tax withholding or other deductions and
excluding such holder's contribution to the Escrow Fund and the Expense Fund
as set forth on the Allocation Schedule).

(d) As promptly as practicable following the Closing (but in no event later
than one (1) Business Day following the Closing), Parent, or the Paying Agent
on behalf of Parent, shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, on behalf of the Company and as accounted for in the calculation of
Estimated Base Merger Consideration Value, (i) the amount of Indebtedness due
at Closing to each lender designated by the Company on the Allocation
Schedule, to an account designated by such lender in the applicable Payoff
Letter and by the Company in the Allocation Schedule and (ii) all Third Party
Expenses payable to any Company advisors or other service providers (other
than any Company employee, director or officer) that remain outstanding as of
the Closing, to such account or accounts as are designated in the applicable
Invoices and by the Company in the Allocation Schedule.

(e) No interest will be paid or will accrue for the benefit of the Company
Securityholders or the Company's lenders, service providers or other creditors
on any Total Merger Consideration or any other amounts payable under this
Agreement.

1.9 Payment and Share Issuance Procedures.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing (but in no event later
than three (3) Business Days following the Closing), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to deliver (which may be done electronically) a letter of
transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J (the
"Letter of Transmittal") to each Company Stockholder and each Company Vested
Optionholder of Non-Employee Options at the address set forth opposite each
such Person's name on the Allocation Schedule. (b) Subject to Section 1.12, as promptly as practicable following receipt by
the Paying Agent of a Letter of Transmittal (and, with respect to the Company
Warrantholder, the Warrant Cancellation Agreement) and any other documents
(including a properly completed IRS Form W-9, or the appropriate version of
IRS Form W-8, as applicable, and, with respect to any Accredited Investor, and
Suitability Documentation) that Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably
require in connection therewith (collectively, the "Exchange Documents"), duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
but for the avoidance of doubt in no event prior to the Effective Time, (i)
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to each Company Stockholder the
cash portion of the Total Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant
to Section 1.7(a) at the Closing as set forth opposite such holder's name in
the Allocation Schedule (such amount, for the avoidance of doubt, to exclude
such holder's contribution to the Escrow Fund and the Expense Fund as set
forth on the Allocation Schedule), (ii) Parent shall cause its transfer agent
to issue to each Accredited Investor the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.7(a) and Section 1.7(c) at
the Closing as set forth opposite such holder's name in the Allocation
Schedule (provided that, with respect to each Founder, any shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable to such Founder that are Revested Merger Consideration
(as defined in the Founder Joinder Agreement to which each such Founder is a
party) shall be deemed issued and outstanding and such Founder shall be the
record owner thereof subject to the terms and conditions of the Joinder
Agreement to which each such Founder is a party, but will be held in a
restricted account for the benefit of such Founder to be released only subject
to the terms of the Joinder Agreement to which such Founder is a party), (iii)
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to each Company Vested Optionholder
(solely with respect to Non-Employee Options) the portion of the Total Merger
Consideration payable to such holder in respect of Non-Employee Options
pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(i) at the Closing as set forth opposite such
holder's name in the Allocation Schedule (such amount, for the avoidance of
doubt, to exclude such holder's contribution to the Escrow Fund and the
Expense Fund as set forth on the Allocation Schedule), and (iv) Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay to the Company Warrantholder the cash portion of
the Total Merger Consideration payable to the Company Warrantholder pursuant
to Section 1.7(c) at the Closing as set forth opposite such holder's name in
the Allocation Schedule (such amount, for the avoidance of doubt, to exclude
such holder's contribution to the Escrow Fund and the Expense Fund as set
forth on the Allocation Schedule).

(c) At any time following the date that is one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to Parent (or its designated successor or assign) all cash amounts
that have been deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.8, and
not disbursed to the Company Securityholders pursuant to Section 1.9 (as well
as any and all interest thereon or other income or proceeds thereof), and
thereafter the Company Securityholders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all cash amounts
that may be payable to such holders pursuant to Section 1.8(b) upon the due
surrender of duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner set forth in
Section 1.9(b). No interest shall be payable to the Company Securityholders
for the cash amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 1.9(c) and which are subsequently delivered to the Company
Securityholders.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.9, none of
Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity nor
any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any portion of the Total Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed
immediately prior to the date on which it would otherwise become subject to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

1.10 Escrow Fund.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, but in no event
later than one (1) Business Day following the Closing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Paying Agent to, transfer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent to hold in trust as an escrow
fund (the "Escrow Fund") under the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

(b) The Escrow Agreement shall be entered into at or prior to the Closing, by
and among Parent, the Securityholder Representative, on behalf of the Company
Indemnitors, and the Escrow Agent, and shall provide Parent with recourse
against the Escrow Fund with respect to (i) any Post-Closing Deficit Amount
under Section 1.15 and (ii) the Company Indemnitors' obligations under Article
VII during the period through the Escrow Expiration Date. The proceeds in the
Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Company Indemnitors, in accordance
with their applicable Pro Rata Shares, and to Parent at the times, and upon
the terms and conditions, set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are specific terms of the Merger, and the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the
Company Indemnitors constitutes approval by such Company Indemnitors, as
specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of such Company
Indemnitors to be bound by and comply with, the Escrow Agreement and all of
the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, including
the deposit of the Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund, the obligations set
forth in Article VII and the appointment and sole authority of the
Securityholder Representative to act on behalf of the Company Indemnitors, as
provided for herein and in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be
held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any Lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall
be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Securityholder Representative agree
for all Tax purposes that: (i) Parent shall be treated as the owner of the
Escrow Cash for Tax purposes, and all interest and earnings earned from the
investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Cash, or any portion thereof, shall
be allocable for Tax purposes to Parent, and (ii) within ten (10) days after
the end of each calendar quarter and immediately prior to the final
distribution of the Escrow Amount to the Company Securityholders, Parent shall
be entitled to a distribution equal to thirty percent (30%) of all interest
and earnings allocated to Parent for Tax purposes for such calendar quarter or
portion thereof.

1.11 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which the Company
Stockholder thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder's appraisal or dissenters' rights under the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
payments set forth in Section 1.7, but such Company Stockholder shall only be
entitled to such rights as are provided by the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 1.11, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights
or dissenters' rights under the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in Section
1.7, without interest thereon, and subject to the escrow provisions set forth
in Section 1.7 and Article VII and expense provisions in Section 7.6, upon the
due surrender of duly executed Exchange Documents in the manner set forth in
Section 1.9.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment
with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such
demands. Any communication to be made by the Company to any Company
Stockholder with respect to such demands shall be submitted to Parent in
advance and shall not be presented to any Company Stockholder prior to the
Company receiving Parent's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

1.12 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
to the Accredited Investors in connection with the Mergers and the Parent
Stock Issuance and any such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Parent shall pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay, to each
Accredited Investor who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregation), in lieu
thereof and upon surrender thereof, an amount in cash (without interest) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all Company Capital Stock held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time and allocated to receive any shares of Parent Common
Stock) in accordance with Section 1.7 by (b) the Parent Common Stock Closing
Price, in each case, as set forth in the Allocation Schedule.

1.13 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent and any
Affiliate of the foregoing shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law or under any
applicable Law or Order, and to request and be provided any necessary tax
forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar information. To the extent any such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid to the proper Governmental Entity or other
appropriate Person, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

1.14 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company, Parent, Merger Subs, and the officers and directors
of the Company, Parent and Merger Subs are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such
lawful and necessary action. 1.15 Post-Closing Reconciliation.

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent its good faith calculation of (i) the estimated
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Closing Working
Capital Adjustment Amount"), (ii) the estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount
(the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount"), (iii) the estimated Closing
Cash Amount (the "Estimated Closing Cash Amount"), (iv) the estimated Closing
Third Party Expenses (the "Estimated Closing Third Party Expenses"), and (v)
the Estimated Base Merger Consideration Value calculated based on such
estimated amounts (including the component pieces thereof) (the "Estimated
Closing Statement"), in each case, accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up
documentation for such calculations. The Company shall prepare the Estimated
Closing Statement in accordance with the applicable definitions in this
Agreement and with GAAP and, solely to the extent consistent with GAAP, in
accordance with the Company's past practices (including the methodologies
applied in the preparation of the Financials) and the principles and sample
calculation set forth in Exhibit L; provided that if there is any
inconsistency between GAAP and the definitions in this Agreement relating to
the items to be set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement, the definitions
shall control. The Company shall make available to Parent and its
Representatives the books and records used in preparing the Estimated Closing
Statement and reasonable access (on prior notice and during business hours) to
employees of the Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with
its review of such statement, and will otherwise cooperate in good faith with
Parent's and its Representatives review of such statement and shall take into
consideration in good faith any comments of Parent on the Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable. The Company may revise the Estimated Closing
Statement prior to the Closing to reflect any comments from Parent and to make
any other changes thereto required to update or correct the information set
forth therein. The Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, and
the Estimated Closing Third Party Expenses set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement, after giving effect to any revisions thereto contemplated by this
Section 1.15(a), will be used for purposes of calculating the Estimated Base
Merger Consideration Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will
any of Parent's rights be considered waived, impaired or otherwise limited as
a result of Parent not making an objection prior to the Closing or its making
an objection that is not fully implemented in a revised Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Securityholder Representative a statement (the "Post-Closing
Statement") that shall set forth a calculation of (i) the Closing Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness Amount, (iii) the
Closing Third Party Expenses, (iv) the Closing Cash Amount and (v) the Base
Merger Consideration Value, in each case accompanied by reasonably detailed
back-up documentation for such calculations. Parent shall prepare the Post-
Closing Statement in accordance with the applicable definitions in this
Agreement and with GAAP and, solely to the extent consistent with GAAP, in
accordance with the Company's past practices (including the methodologies
applied in the preparation of the Financials), in each case in a manner
consistent with the Estimated Closing Statement and the principles and sample
calculation set forth in Exhibit L; provided that if there is any
inconsistency between GAAP and the definitions in this Agreement relating to
the items to be set forth on the Post-Closing Statement, the definitions shall
control. After the Securityholder Representative's receipt of the Post-Closing
Statement, the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives shall be
permitted to review Parent's working papers and the working papers of Parent's independent accountants, if any, relating to the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, Closing Indebtedness Amount, Closing Cash
Amount and Closing Third Party Expenses after signing a customary
confidentiality and non-reliance agreement relating to such access to working
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent's independent
accountants, to the extent required by such accountants, which confidentiality
and non-reliance agreement shall not prohibit the Securityholder
Representative from communicating any such information with the Company
Indemnitors who have a need to know such information, provided that any such
recipients are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect thereto, as
well as the relevant books and records of the Company, and Parent shall cause
the Company and its Representatives to use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives in their
reasonable review of the Post-Closing Statement. The Securityholder
Representative shall notify Parent in writing (the "Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement") within thirty (30) days of the Securityholder Representative's
receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (the "Adjustment Review Period") if the
Securityholder Representative disagrees with any portion of the Post-Closing
Statement. The Notice of Adjustment Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and the
Securityholder Representative's proposed adjustments to the Post-Closing
Statement with reasonably detailed supporting documentation. If no Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement is received by Parent on or prior to the expiration
date of the Adjustment Review Period, then the Post-Closing Statement and all
amounts set forth therein shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Securityholder Representative and shall become final and binding upon the
parties hereto and the Company Indemnitors for all purposes under this
Agreement. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (the "Adjustment Resolution Period"), if
any, the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall seek in good faith to
resolve any disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement. Any items agreed to by the
Securityholder Representative and Parent in a written agreement executed and
delivered by each of the Securityholder Representative and Parent, together
with any items not disputed or objected to by the Securityholder
Representative in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, are collectively
referred to herein as the "Resolved Matters." If at the end of the Adjustment
Resolution Period, the parties have been unable to resolve any differences
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement, the Securityholder Representative and Parent, or
either of them, shall refer all matters in the Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement other than the Resolved Matters (the "Unresolved Matters") to
Grant Thornton (the "Independent Accountant"). In the event that Grant
Thornton refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant,
the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to
appoint an independent certified public accounting firm in the United States
of national recognition mutually agreeable to the Securityholder
Representative and Parent, in which event "Independent Accountant" shall mean
such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission of such matters to the
Independent Accountant, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on the parties
hereto for all purposes under this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of
each of the Unresolved Matters. With respect to each Unresolved Matter, such
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either the
Securityholder Representative or Parent, shall not be in excess of the higher,
nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the Securityholder
Representative in the Notice of Adjustment Disagreement or Parent in the Post-
Closing Statement with respect to such Unresolved Matter. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accountant shall not review any line items in the Post-
Closing Statement or make any determination with respect to any matter other than the Unresolved Matters. During the review by
the Independent Accountant, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall
each make available to the Independent Accountant such individuals and such
information, books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by
the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.15(b); provided, that the independent accountants of Parent or the Company
shall not be obligated to make any working papers available to the Independent
Accountant unless and until the Independent Accountant has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by Parent and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Indemnitors) based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Independent Accountant's resolution of the disputed items covered by such
Notice of Adjustment Disagreement (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of such disputed items as originally submitted to the Independent
Accountant (for example, if the total amount of such disputed items as
originally submitted to the Independent Accountant equals $1,000 and the
Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Securityholder
Representative's position, sixty percent (60%) of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant would be borne by Parent and forty percent (40%) of the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant would be borne by the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Indemnitors)).

(c) The "Final Closing Statement" shall be (i) in the event that no Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement is delivered by the Securityholder Representative to
Parent prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period, the Post-
Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the Securityholder Representative
pursuant to Section 1.15(b), (ii) in the event that a Notice of Adjustment
Disagreement is delivered by the Securityholder Representative to Parent prior
to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period and Parent and the
Securityholder Representative are able to agree on all matters set forth in
such Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, the Post-Closing Statement delivered
by Parent to the Securityholder Representative pursuant to Section 1.15(b) as
adjusted pursuant to the written agreement executed and delivered by Parent
and the Securityholder Representative or (iii) in the event that a Notice of
Adjustment Disagreement is delivered by the Securityholder Representative to
Parent prior to the expiration of the Adjustment Review Period and Parent and
the Securityholder Representative are unable to agree on all matters set forth
in such Notice of Adjustment Disagreement, the Post-Closing Statement
delivered by Parent to the Securityholder Representative pursuant to Section
1.15(b) as adjusted by the Independent Accountant to be consistent with the
Resolved Matters and the final determination of the Independent Accountant of
the Unresolved Matters in accordance with Section 1.15(b). The date on which
the Final Closing Statement is finally determined in accordance with this
Section 1.15(c) is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date." The
Final Closing Statement and all amounts set forth therein shall be final and
binding upon the parties hereto and the Company Indemnitors for all purposes
under this Agreement.

(d) If the Base Merger Consideration Value set forth in the Final Closing
Statement (as finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.15) is less
than the Estimated Base Merger Consideration Value set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement (after giving effect to any revisions thereto in accordance
with Section 1.15(a)) (such difference, the "Post-Closing Deficit Amount"),
then Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall promptly (but in all
events within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date), instruct
the Escrow Agent to promptly release to Parent (i) from the Escrow Fund an
amount of cash and stock, with such stock valued at the Parent Common Stock Price, equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Deficit Amount (plus
any costs allocated to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Indemnitors in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares of the
remaining Escrow Amount) pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.15(b)).
For avoidance of doubt, any recovery of any such Post-Closing Deficit Amount
shall not be subject to any of the procedures for indemnification set forth in
Section 7.2, it being understood that the sole recourse therefore shall be
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the preceding sentence. Any payment of any
Post-Closing Deficit Amount made pursuant to this Section 1.15(d) shall be pro
rata from the cash and stock portion of the Escrow Amount.

(e) If the Base Merger Consideration Value set forth in the Final Closing
Statement (as finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.15) is more
than the Estimated Base Merger Consideration Value set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement (after giving effect to any revisions thereto in accordance
with Section 1.15(a)) (such difference, the "Post-Closing Excess Amount"),
then, subject to Section 4.2(f), Parent shall promptly (but in all events
within five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date) pay the Post-
Closing Excess Amount in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, in the same
proportion of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock payable to the Company
Indemnitors pursuant to Section 1.7(a)(i), Section 1.7(b)(i) and Section
1.7(c), to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company
Indemnitors in accordance with their applicable pro rata portion of such Post-
Closing Excess Amount; provided, that as a condition to Parent's and Paying
Agent's obligation to make such payment, the Securityholder Representative
shall first deliver to Parent an updated Allocation Schedule setting forth the
pro rata portion of the Post-Closing Excess Amount payable to each Company
Indemnitor.

(f) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to conclusively rely
upon the updated Allocation Schedule delivered by the Securityholder
Representative, including with respect to whether any individual Company
Indemnitor received the appropriate portion of any such distribution, and in
no event will Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their Affiliates have any
liability to any person on account of payments or distributions made in
accordance with the updated Allocation Schedule delivered by the
Securityholder Representative.

1.16 Equitable Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the
Agreement Date and the Effective Time (and with respect to any provision
hereof where the Parent Common Stock Closing Price is to be used as the basis
for valuing shares of Parent Common Stock for any purpose after the Effective
Time, on or prior to the applicable valuation date), any change in the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, any number or amount contained in this Agreement which is
based on the price of Parent Common Stock or the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide
the parties the same economic effect with respect to the Parent Common Stock
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or stock dividend thereon. ARTICLE II

Documents.

(b) Section 2.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and

Company Stockholders and the number and type of such shares so owned by each
such Company Stockholder and any beneficial holders thereof and (ii) the

Company Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-

whether currently outstanding or that may subsequently be issued. All issued
and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and all Company Options were,
in all material respects, issued in compliance with Law and all requirements
set forth in the Charter Documents and any applicable Contracts to which the

contained therein as indicated in Section 2.2(d) of the Disclosure Schedule)
and (iv) there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding (written or oral)
to amend, modify or supplement any such award agreement in any case from the

date of its incorporation has never had, any Subsidiary, nor does the Company
control, directly or indirectly, or have any direct or indirect equity
participation in any other Person. The Company does not directly or indirectly

effective in accordance with their respective terms, subject to (i) laws of
general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors, and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive

withdrawn.

(c) The Company has good title to, or valid leasehold interest in all of its
tangible properties, real and personal, reflected on the Current Balance Sheet
or acquired after the Balance Sheet Date (except properties and assets sold or
otherwise disposed of since the Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of
Business), or, with respect to leased tangible properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in such tangible properties and assets that afford the
Company valid leasehold possession of the tangible properties that are the subject of such leases, in each case, free
and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens.

(d) The tangible assets and properties owned, leased and licensed by the

the age and length of use and ordinary wear and tear), are in all material
respects in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and are adequate and suitable for the uses to which they are being
put. No maintenance of such assets has been materially deferred by the

neither of the Merger Subs has incurred any obligation or liability nor
engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered
into any agreement or arrangement with any Person.

3.9 Reorganization. Neither Parent nor either of the Merger Subs has taken or
agreed to take any action that is not contemplated by this Agreement, and

however, that neither Parent nor either of the Merger Subs is making any
representation or warranty under this Section 3.9 with respect to the value of

ARTICLE IV 

STOCKHOLDER AND TAX MATTERS

4.1 Company Board Recommendation; Stockholder Notice; Securityholder Notice.

(a) Once the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, neither
the Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify,
or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the Board that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the Agreement Date, the Company
shall prepare, with the cooperation of Parent, and send to each Company
Stockholder (other than the Company Stockholders who previously executed the
Company Stockholder Approval), a notice (as it may be amended or supplemented
from time to time, the "Stockholder Notice") comprising (i) the notice
contemplated by Section 228(e) of the DGCL of the taking of a corporate action
without a meeting by less than a unanimous written consent, (ii) the notice
contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, together with a copy of Section
262 of the DGCL and (iii) an information statement to the Company
Stockholders. The Stockholder Notice shall include (x) a statement to the
effect that the Board had unanimously recommended that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) such other
information as Parent and the Company may agree is required or advisable under
the DGCL to be included therein. Following the mailing of the Stockholder
Notice, no amendment or supplement to the Stockholder Notice shall be made by
the Company without the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees to provide promptly to the other such information concerning its
business, financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of
Parent or its counsel, may be required or advisable to be included under the
DGCL in the Stockholder Notice or in any amendment or supplement thereto, and
Parent and the Company agree to cause their respective Representatives to
cooperate in the preparation of the Stockholder Notice and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide the Company
Securityholders (other than the Company Stockholders so notified pursuant to
Section 4.1(b)) with valid and timely notification of the Mergers to the
extent required by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Charter
Documents, any Laws, or any agreement or instruments governing the Company
Securities (other than the Company Capital Stock). 4.2 Tax Matters.

(a) Preparation of Tax Returns.

(i) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Company
(taking into account any extension properly obtained) on or before the Closing
Date ("Company Prepared Returns"), and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all
Taxes of the Company due on or before the Closing Date. All Company Prepared
Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Company with respect to such items,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law. At least fifteen (15) days
prior to filing a Company Prepared Return that is an income or other material
Tax Return, the Company shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Parent for
Parent's review and comment and Company will consider in good faith any
reasonable comments received in writing from Parent within ten (10) days of
Company's delivery of such Company Prepared Returns. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall not initiate any discussions with a Governmental
Entity with respect to Taxes, or enter into any voluntary disclosures with
respect to Taxes, without prior written notice to, and consent of, Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(ii) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns for the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (the
"Parent Prepared Returns"). All such Parent Prepared Returns with an initial
due date for filing after the Closing Date that are not for a Straddle Period
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past practice,
except (x) as otherwise required by applicable Law or (y) to the extent that
any such deviation from past practice could not reasonably be expected to give
rise to an increased claim for indemnification under this Agreement. In the
event that any Parent Prepared Returns shows any material Pre-Closing Taxes
that may form the basis for a claim of indemnification against the Company
Indemnitors pursuant to this Agreement, Parent will submit such Parent
Prepared Return to the Securityholder Representative for review and comment a
commercially reasonable period of time prior to filing (which, in the case of
any income Tax Return required to be filed more than fifteen (15) days after
the Closing Date, shall be at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing) and
Parent will consider in good faith any reasonable comments received in writing
from the Securityholder Representative within ten (10) days of Parent's
delivery of such Parent Prepared Return.

(b) Cooperation. Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to the Company or
its operations and any pending or threatened audit, Legal Proceedings or
assessments with respect thereto or to Taxes owed by the Company. Such
cooperation shall include Parent's retention and provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other Legal
Proceedings and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company be entitled to review or otherwise
have access to any income Tax Return, or information related thereto, of
Parent or its Affiliates (other than income Tax Returns of the Company for
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date).

(c) Transfer Taxes. The liability for all Transfer Taxes shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Company Indemnitors and fifty percent (50%) by Parent.
Parent, the Company and the Company Indemnitors shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including joining in the
execution of any such Tax Return or other documentation where necessary.
Parent and Company Indemnitors shall, upon request of the other party, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Transfer Taxes. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Parent shall
be responsible for preparing and timely filing any Tax Return relating to
Transfer Taxes.

(d) Post-Closing Tax Actions. Unless required by applicable Law, Parent and
the Company shall not amend any Tax Return of the Company with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, initiate discussions or examinations with governmental
authorities regarding Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, make any
voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, or
change any accounting method that shifts taxable income from a Tax period
beginning (or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or shifts deductions or losses from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Tax
period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date, in each case,
without the prior written consent of Securityholder Representative (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the extent any
such action, initiation of discussions or examinations, voluntary disclosure,
or change in accounting method would reasonably be expected to result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to Article VII.

(e) Tax Claims. If, subsequent to the Closing, any of Parent, its Affiliates
or the Securityholder Representative receives written notice of a claim by any
governmental authority relating to Taxes of the Company that, if successful,
may reasonably be expected to result in an indemnity payment pursuant to
Article VII (a "Tax Claim"), then within five (5) Business Days after receipt
of such notice, the party receiving such notice shall give written notice of
such Tax Claim to the other parties; provided, that no delay or failure on the
part of Parent in delivering any such notice shall cause any Parent
Indemnified Party to forfeit any indemnification rights under Article VII,
except to the extent that the Company Indemnitors are actually prejudiced by
such delay or failure. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Claim; provided, however, that
(i) the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled (on behalf of the
Company Indemnitors and at their expense) to participate in, but not to
control, determine or conduct, the defense of such Tax Claim, and (ii) except
with the consent of the Securityholder Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no settlement of any Tax Claim
shall be determinative of the right of any Parent Indemnified Party to be
indemnified with respect to such Tax Claim or settlement or any Losses
relating thereto; provided, further, that the consent of the Securityholder
Representative with respect to any settlement of any Tax Claim shall be deemed
to have been given unless the Securityholder Representative shall have
objected within thirty (30) day after a written request for such consent by
Parent. In the event that the Securityholder Representative has consented to
any such settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Company Indemnitors shall
have no power or authority to object under any provision of Article VII to the
amount of such settlement, adjustment or compromise.

(f) Tax Treatment. The Mergers are intended to be treated as integrated steps
in a single transaction and together to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended
to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and Section 1.368-3. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or
the Company after consultation with their respective Tax advisors, the value of the portion of the Total Merger
Consideration payable or issuable to Company Stockholders in respect of
Company Capital Stock (the "Total Stockholder Consideration") that is
comprised of shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Portion") is not at
least 40% of the aggregate value of the Total Stockholder Consideration (the
"Reorg Threshold"), determined using the Parent Common Stock Closing Price,
then the portion of the Total Stockholder Consideration that is comprised of
cash (the "Cash Portion") shall be reduced and the Stock Portion shall be
increased to the minimum extent necessary, determined using the Parent Common
Stock Closing Price, to achieve the Reorg Threshold. For the avoidance of
doubt, for each additional share of Parent Common Stock that is added to the
Stock Portion, the Cash Portion shall be reduced by the Parent Common Stock
Closing Price. For purposes of calculating the Total Stockholder Consideration
under this Section 4.2(f) at the Closing, (i) it shall be assumed that the
Expense Fund is paid in full to the Company Indemnitors, (ii) the Revested
Merger Consideration (as defined in the Founder Joinder Agreements) shall be
accounted for without regard to the vesting restrictions imposed therein, and
(iii) any Post-Closing Deficit Amount or Post-Closing Excess Amount, as
applicable, shall not be taken into account. Once the Post-Closing Deficit
Amount or Post-Closing Excess Amount, as applicable, are determined pursuant
to Section 1.15(e), appropriate adjustments to the mix of cash and Parent
Common Stock payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.15(e)
shall be made in a manner consistent with this Section 4.2(f), if necessary,
to ensure that the Stock Portion of the Total Stockholder Consideration after
giving effect to any such payments is not less than the Reorg Threshold.

(g) Each of Parent and the Company shall report the Mergers as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the Code on its U.S.
federal income Tax Return for the taxable year including the Closing Date and
shall file all applicable U.S. state and local income Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Mergers constituting a reorganization unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Neither of the Company, nor Parent shall (and
after the Closing, Parent shall not permit the Company or any other Affiliate
of Parent to) knowingly take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the Mergers from being treated as a reorganization for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, other than any actions that are required by the
provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no
representations or warranties to the Company or to any Company Securityholder
regarding the Tax treatment of the Mergers, or any of the Tax consequences to
the Company or any Company Securityholder of this Agreement, the Mergers or
any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company
acknowledges that the Company and the Company Securityholders are relying
solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the
Mergers and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby.

4.3 Allocation Schedule.

(a) The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a spreadsheet (the
"Allocation Schedule") at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which Allocation Schedule shall be
dated as of the Closing Date and shall set forth all of the information (in
addition to the other required data and information specified therein) set
forth on Schedule C hereto, as of immediately prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in Schedule C to the contrary, the
Allocation Schedule shall be appropriately modified to the extent necessary to
give effect to Section 1.7(a)(ii), if applicable.

(b) The Allocation Schedule shall be accompanied by reasonably detailed back-
up documentation for the calculations contained therein. The Company shall
make available to Parent and its Representatives the work papers (subject to the execution of customary
work paper access letters, if requested) and other books and records used in
preparing the Allocation Schedule and reasonable access to Employees of the
Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with its review of the
Allocation Schedule, and will otherwise cooperate in good faith with Parent's
and its Representatives review and shall take into consideration in good faith
any comments of Parent on the Allocation Schedule. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event will any of Parent's rights be considered waived,
impaired or otherwise limited as a result of Parent not making an objection
prior to the Closing or its making an objection that is not fully implemented
in a revised Allocation Schedule, as applicable.

4.4 Securities Law Exemption; Transfer Restrictions; Stop-Transfer
Instructions, Securities Law Compliance.

(a) Each of the parties hereto (other than the Securityholder Representative)
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the issuance of all shares of
Parent Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the
Mergers to validly qualify for an exemption from the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and the equivalent
state "blue sky" laws.

(b) The shares of Parent Common Stock constitute "restricted securities" under
the Securities Act, and may not be transferred absent registration under the
Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and any such transfer shall be
subject to compliance with applicable state securities Laws. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in connection with this Agreement shall bear a
legend or legends referencing restrictions applicable to such shares under
applicable securities Laws and under this Agreement, which legend shall state
in substance:

"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the
United States (a "State Act") in reliance upon certain exemptions from
registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this certificate
cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the United States
unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and in accordance
with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not subject to, the
Securities Act and each applicable State Act."

Parent shall instruct its transfer agent to remove such legend from the shares
of Parent Common Stock issued hereunder on the date that is twelve months
following the Closing Date subject to Rule 144 under the Securities Act;
provided, further, that Parent shall facilitate resales of Parent Common Stock
occurring on or after the date that is six months following the Agreement Date
in respect of a sale that is compliant with Rule 144 by instructing its
transfer agent to remove such legends in connection with any such Rule
144-compliant sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Accredited Investor may transfer shares of
Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in a transaction that does not
constitute a sale under Rule 144 to (i) to an Affiliate of such Accredited
Investor, (ii) if the Accredited Investor is an individual, to an immediate
family member or trust for the benefit of such Accredited Investor or one or
more of such Accredited Investor's immediate family members, (iii) pursuant to
the laws of testamentary or intestate succession or otherwise involuntarily
transferred by operation of law, or (iv) if the Accredited Investor is a
partnership, corporation, or limited liability company, to any one or more
partners, stockholders or members thereof; provided, however, that (A) such Accredited Investor shall give Parent written
notice prior to the time of such transfer stating the name and address of the
transferee and identifying the shares being transferred to the transferee and
(B) such transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, to be bound by the provisions of this Section 4.4. Any
such transferee of shares pursuant to this Section 4.4(b) is referred to
herein as a "Permitted Transferee."

(c) To ensure compliance with the restrictions imposed by this Agreement,
Parent may issue appropriate "stop-transfer" instructions to its transfer
agent. Parent shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares of
Parent Common Stock that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation
of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such
shares of Parent Common Stock, or to accord the right to vote or pay
dividends, to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such shares of Parent
Common Stock has been purportedly so transferred.

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep
public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and file with the SEC in a timely manner
all reports and other documents required to be filed by Parent under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

(e) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock being issued in the Mergers to be approved for listing
(subject to notice of issuance) on the New York Stock Exchange effective as of
the Closing.

4.5 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company.

(a) During the period ending six (6) years after the Effective Time (and, if
applicable, for any subsequent period of time during the pendency, and through
the resolution, of any DandO Indemnifiable Matter(s) initiated during such six-
year period), the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or their
respective successors shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Entity or their respective successors to, fulfill their
obligations to the present and former members of the Board and present and
former officers of the Company (such directors and officers being herein
called the "Company Indemnitees") pursuant to the terms of the Charter
Documents as in effect on the Agreement Date and any indemnification
agreements between the Company and such Company Indemnitees set forth on
Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (such obligations, collectively, the
"DandO Indemnifiable Matters"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or their
respective successors in respect of the DandO Indemnifiable Matters (i) shall be
subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law, the terms of the Charter
Documents and/or the terms of the applicable indemnification agreement and
(ii) shall not be deemed to release any Company Indemnitee who is also an
officer or director of the Company from his or her obligations pursuant to
this Agreement or any Related Agreement to which such Person is a party.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase and fully pay (and
such purchase price shall be included in Third Party Expenses of the Company)
for an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent that shall provide the Company Indemnitees with coverage
for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing
coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured
persons than the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company (the "DandO Tail Policy"). Parent
shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Entity to not, take
any action to eliminate such DandO Tail Policy. The cost of any DandO Tail Policy
shall be considered a Third Party Expense for purposes of this Agreement. At
or prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide a copy of the DandO Tail
Policy to Parent, along with written confirmation from the insurance provider
that the DandO Tail Policy will be bound at Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 4.5 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnitee to whom this Section
4.5 applies without the consent of such affected Company Indemnitee, it being
understood and agreed that the Company Indemnitees are intended to be express
third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with rights of enforcement.

4.6 Continuing Employee Retention Awards. Prior to the Agreement Date, the
board of directors of Parent adopted resolutions establishing a retention pool
in an aggregate amount, as of the date of grant, of $15,000,000 in the form of
restricted stock units covering shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Retention
Pool") that will be granted as set forth below to the Continuing Employees in
accordance with Schedule 4.6. The Retention Awards to be made out of the
Retention Pool to any Continuing Employees who enter into Offer Letters with
Parent (and who do not revoke such Offer Letters) prior to the Closing will be
set forth in the applicable Offer Letter. Each Retention Award shall vest in a
manner generally consistent with the standard vesting schedule for a Parent
equity award of the same type as the Retention Award that Parent grants to its
new hire employees from time to time, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, provided that the vesting period of a Retention Award shall not
exceed four years. On the next quarterly Parent equity grant date following
the Closing, Parent will grant the Retention Awards to Continuing Employees in
accordance with Schedule 4.6.

Waiver from each Person who the Company or Parent reasonably believes could
be, with respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder), and who might otherwise have received, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a Section 280G
Payment (as defined below), unless the 280G Stockholder Approval (as defined

vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock was solicited in conformance with
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the
requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and
benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote (the "280G Stockholder
Approval") or (ii) that the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained;
provided, that the parties agree that this Section 5.6 shall not be deemed
breached by reason of (x) the refusal of any disqualified individual executing
a waiver or (y) the value of any Parent Arrangements.

5.7 Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the
Company have previously executed that certain confidentiality agreement dated
July 13, 2020, by and between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality

its terms. Each party hereto agrees that it and its Representatives shall hold
the terms of this Agreement, and the fact of this Agreement's existence, in
strict confidence, and at no time shall any party or its Representatives

without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the foregoing (including in the Confidentiality Agreement),
a party hereto shall be permitted to disclose any and all terms (i) to its

obligation of confidentiality), (ii) to any Governmental Entity or
administrative agency to the extent necessary or advisable in compliance with
applicable Law and the rules of the primary exchange on which such party is
then listed, (iii) to Persons to which such party is otherwise incurring Third
Party Expenses (but only to the extent reasonably necessary for such Person to
perform its services in connection therewith), (iv) as reasonably necessary
for the Company to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and the other
consents and approvals of the Company Stockholders and other third parties
contemplated by this Agreement, (v) in connection with enforcing its rights or
defending itself against any claims hereunder and (vi) as otherwise permitted
by Section 5.8. The Securityholder Representative hereby agrees to hold the
terms of this Agreement, the fact of this Agreement's existence, and
information relating to the Mergers or this Agreement received by the
Securityholder Representative after the Closing or relating to the period
after the Closing in strict confidence, and at no time shall the
Securityholder Representative disclose any of the terms of this Agreement (including the economic terms) or any non-public
information about a party hereto to any other Person without the prior written
consent of Parent (and, prior to Closing, the Company); provided, however,
following Closing, the Securityholder Representative shall be permitted to
disclose information as required by law or to employees, advisors, agents or

Securityholders, in each case who have a need to know such information,

writing to Parent. 5.10 Reasonable Best Efforts.

ARTICLE VII 

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW

7.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement and in the Certificates, and the right of any Parent
Indemnified Party to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto, shall survive the Closing Date until 11:59 p.m. (California time) on
the Escrow Expiration Date; provided, that in the event of Fraud with respect
to a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in the
Certificates, as applicable, such representation or warranty, and the right to
assert such a claim, shall survive until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations applicable to common law fraud in Delaware; provided,
further, that (a) the Fundamental Representations other than the
representations and warranties contained in Section 2.9 (Tax Matters) (the
"Tax Representations"), and the right to assert such a claim, shall remain in
full force and effect until 11:59 p.m. (California time) on the date that is
three (3) years following the Closing Date and (b) the Tax Representations,
and the right to assert such a claim, shall remain in full force and effect
until the expiration of the statutes of limitations (including any extensions
or waivers thereof) applicable to the subject matter of such Tax
Representations; provider further, if an Indemnification Claim Notice or Third Party Notice is given under, and in accordance with, this Article VII with
respect to any representation or warranty prior to the applicable expiration
date, such claim shall be preserved until such claim is finally resolved. The
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Subs set forth in this
Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time; provided, that in the event
of Fraud with respect to a representation or warranty contained in Article III
or in the Parent Certificate, as applicable, such representation or warranty,
and the right to assert such a claim, shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations applicable to common law fraud in
Delaware. The covenants and agreements of the Company that by their terms are
to be performed or complied with at or prior to the Closing, and the right of
any Parent Indemnified Party to assert a claim for indemnification hereunder
with respect thereto, shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (California time) on the
date that is fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date. Each other
covenant and agreement of any party herein shall survive until fully performed
in accordance with its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention
of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival periods and
termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations that would
otherwise apply to such representations and warranties and covenants and the
right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement,
and the Company Indemnitors and the Parent Indemnified Parties hereby waive
any claims or defenses based on the statute of limitations to the extent
inconsistent with the survival periods set forth herein.

7.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to Section 7.3 and the other limitations set forth in this Article
VII, from and after the consummation of the First Merger, the Company
Indemnitors shall (i) jointly, to the extent of the funds then available in
the Escrow Fund, and (ii) as to any amounts exceeding the funds then available
in the Escrow Fund, severally, and not jointly, in accordance with each
Company Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share (subject to Section 7.3(c) with respect to
any Company Indemnitor who committed or had actual knowledge of Fraud),
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity), agents and other representatives
(the "Parent Indemnified Parties"), from and against all Losses paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties, or any of
them, resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company in this
Agreement or the Certificates to be true and correct on the Agreement Date and
as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date, except that
any such representations and warranties which by their express terms are made
solely as of a specified earlier date shall be true and correct as of such
specified earlier date; provided, that all materiality qualifications (such as
"material" and "Material Adverse Effect", other than the use of the word
"material" as part of any defined term) in such representations and warranties
shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating Losses under this Article
VII;

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement applicable to it contained in this Agreement that is to be performed
or complied with at or prior to the Closing;

(iii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information set forth in the Allocation
Schedule other than any inaccuracies with respect to the items set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement (which shall be governed by Section 1.15); (iv) any Fraud in respect of the representations and warranties in Article II
of this Agreement or in the Certificates;

(v) the exercise by any Company Stockholder of appraisal or dissenters'
rights, including payments in respect of such Person's Dissenting Shares to
the extent such payments exceed the cash amount to which such Person would
have been entitled pursuant to Section 1.11 in respect of such Dissenting
Shares if such Person had not exercised appraisal rights in respect thereof,
and any breach of fiduciary duties claims in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

(vi) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent such amounts were not
taken into account in the Closing Indebtedness Amount or Closing Third Party
Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.15.

(b) The rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under
this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time (other than as a result of disclosures set forth on the face of the
Disclosure Schedule), whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of
or compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right
to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any
other remedy under this Agreement based on any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. Other than with respect to any claim for Fraud, no
Parent Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in order for such Parent
Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of
any party to any Related Agreement to pursue remedies under such Related
Agreement against any other party thereto with respect to any breaches of such
Related Agreements by such other party.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, there shall be
no indemnification provided for, and the Company makes no representations or
warranties regarding, (i) the amount, value or condition of, or any
limitations on, any net operating losses or Tax credit of the Company arising
in any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a "Tax Attribute") in a Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date, or the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to utilize such Tax
Attributes in a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, and (ii) any
Taxes resulting from any action taken by or with respect to the Company after
the Closing on the Closing Date outside the Ordinary Course of Business not
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.

7.3 Certain Limitations.

(a) Except in the case of Fraud, and subject to Section 7.3(b), the Parent
Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not recover any Losses pursuant to an
indemnification claim under Section 7.2(a) unless and until the Parent
Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained at least $250,000 in Losses in the aggregate (the "Deductible
Amount"), at which time the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover in accordance with this
Agreement all such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount, subject to the
other limitations in this Agreement.

(b) Except in the case of Fraud and indemnification claims related to any
breach of or inaccuracy in the Fundamental Representations, the Parent
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) shall be recourse against the Escrow Fund.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the other limitations in this
Article VII, in the event the Parent Indemnified Parties have recovered Losses
from the Escrow Fund for Fraud pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iv) (such amounts,
to the extent recovered from the Escrow Fund, the "Recovered Fraud Amounts"),
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have direct recourse against the Company
Indemnitors, severally and not jointly, for claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) for
breaches of representations and warranties, other than Fundamental
Representations, up to an amount equal to the Recovered Fraud Amounts.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7.3(a) and 7.3(b), the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to bring indemnification claims
directly against the Company Indemnitors pursuant to the claims procedures in
Section 7.4; provided that any Losses with respect to such claims for
indemnification, other than those under Section 7.2(a)(iv), shall first be
recovered from the Escrow Fund to the extent there are funds then remaining
therein; provided, further that in no event shall the aggregate liability of
any Company Indemnitor for (i) all indemnification claims related to any
breach or inaccuracy in the representations contained in Sections 2.12(a)
through (n) and (q) (Intellectual Property) exceed the IP Indemnification Cap
and (ii) all indemnification claims under this Agreement exceed the amount of
Total Merger Consideration, in each case as received by such Company
Indemnitor (provided that the portion of the Escrow Amount and, in the case of
each Founder, the Revested Merger Consideration shall be treated as received
for purposes of this sentence), unless such indemnity claim is being made in
respect of Fraud committed by such Company Indemnitor or Fraud of which such
Company Indemnitor had actual knowledge (in which event there shall be no
limitation on the liability of such Company Indemnitor that committed or had
actual knowledge of such Fraud hereunder with respect to such Fraud). In no
event shall any Company Indemnitor have any liability for (x) any Fraud
committed by any other Company Indemnitor except for Fraud of which such
Company Indemnitor had actual knowledge or (y) for any breach by any other
Company Indemnitor of any Related Agreement entered into by such Company
Indemnitor.

(d) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments or reimbursements actually received by the Parent
Indemnified Parties from third parties (other than the Company Indemnitors) in
respect of such Losses (net of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining
such insurance, indemnification or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums or retro-premium adjustments resulting from such recovery);
provided that, except for the following sentence, nothing in this Section
7.3(d) shall be construed as or give rise to an obligation on the part of
Parent or any Parent Indemnified Party to seek any such insurance,
indemnification or reimbursement. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under the DandO Tail Policy
with respect to any applicable Losses. If any Parent Indemnified Party
receives any such insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or
reimbursements from third parties (other than the Company Indemnitors) with
respect to any Losses for which it has already received an indemnification
payment hereunder (whether from the Escrow Fund or directly from any Company
Indemnitor), it shall deposit an amount equal to the portion of the
indemnification payment for which it received such a third party recovery (net of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery,
including any increases in insurance premiums or retro-premium adjustments
resulting from such recovery) into the Escrow Fund (if the Escrow Expiration
Date has not yet occurred and to the extent such indemnification payment was
made from the Escrow Fund) or with the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Company Indemnitors who paid for such Losses based on their relative Pro Rata
Shares.

(e) For purposes of determining the maximum liability under this Article VII
of a particular Company Indemnitor who receives shares of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger, the shares of Parent Common Stock received by such Company
Indemnitor shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Common Stock
Closing Price. The foregoing shall not be deemed to limit in any way the
liability of a Company Indemnitor for such Company Indemnitor's own Fraud or
of Fraud of which such Company Indemnitor had actual knowledge.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, any Losses for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery due to the facts
giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or other indemnifiable matter
under Section 7.2. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement with respect to any amount or
item to the extent such amount or item was actually and specifically included
in the calculation of the Base Merger Consideration Value as finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.15.

(g) Parent and Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that the sole and exclusive
remedy for the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein, for any of the other matters set forth in Section
7.2, or otherwise resulting from or arising out of this Agreement, the Mergers
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, will be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII; provided, that the
foregoing clause of this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of
(i) any right to specific performance or injunctive relief, (ii) any right or
remedy of a party under any Related Agreement to which it is party, or (iii)
any right or remedy against a particular Company Indemnitor with respect to
such Company Indemnitor's own Fraud or Fraud of which such Company Indemnitor
had actual knowledge, and all claims related to such Company Indemnitor's own
Fraud or Fraud of which such Company Indemnitor had actual knowledge shall
survive until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to
common law fraud in Delaware. All claims for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under this Article VII shall be asserted by Parent on behalf of
the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties. Subject to the other limitations
contained herein, the obligations of the Company Indemnitors under this
Article VII shall not be reduced, offset, eliminated or subject to
contribution by reason of any action or inaction by the Company that
contributed to any inaccuracy or breach giving rise to such obligation, it
being understood that the Company Indemnitors, not the Company, shall have the
sole obligation for the indemnification obligations under this Article VII.

7.4 Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts.

(a) Subject to the survival periods in Section 7.1 and the limitations set
forth in Section 7.3 hereof, if a Parent Indemnified Party wishes to make an
indemnification claim under this Article VII, Parent, on behalf of such Parent
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice") to the Securityholder Representative (i) stating that such Parent
Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably
anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses and (ii) specifying such Losses in reasonable
detail (to the extent available), and, if applicable, the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. To the extent reasonably practicable, Parent shall include with the
Indemnification Claim Notice such documents and other information available to
Parent in support of the claims asserted therein, and shall provide such other
information as the Securityholder Representative may reasonably request in
order to allow the Securityholder Representative to assess the merits of the
claims. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to
reflect any change in circumstances following the date thereof, so long as
such update reasonably relates to the underlying facts and circumstances
specifically set forth in such original Indemnification Claim Notice.

(b) If the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnitors
shall not object in writing within the twenty (20) Business Day period after
receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of
objection containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification claim
(an "Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall
be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Securityholder Representative on
behalf of the Company Indemnitors that the Parent Indemnified Party is
entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice if and to the extent such Losses are actually
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, but subject to the other limitations on
recovery set forth herein. In such event, Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of the resolution of such Indemnification Claim Notice) deliver a joint
written instruction (a "Joint Instruction") to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to immediately release to Parent from the Escrow Fund, to the
extent then available, cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice (or as much cash as is then
available in the Escrow Fund in the event such Losses exceed the then
available balance of the Escrow Fund).

(c) In the event that the Securityholder Representative shall timely deliver
an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(b),
the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Securityholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and, in the case of an indemnification claim to be recovered from the
Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and make distributions
from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. In such event, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release to Parent from the Escrow Fund a portion
of the Escrow Amount equal to the Losses set forth in such memorandum (or as
much of the Escrow Amount as is then available in the Escrow Fund in the event
such Losses exceed the then available balance of the Escrow Fund). Should the
amount held in the Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole
the amount to be paid to a Parent Indemnified Party in accordance with such
memorandum, then, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII,
each Company Indemnitor shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the
date of such memorandum, pay to the Parent Indemnified Party, such Company
Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share of such shortfall.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within
thirty (30) days after the timely delivery of an Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice by the Securityholder Representative in accordance with
Section 7.4(b), either Parent or the Securityholder Representative may demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Losses is at issue in
pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such
event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted in accordance with
Section 9.12. The decision of the arbitrator (or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as applicable) in such arbitration proceeding pursuant to Section
9.12 as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification Claim
Notice shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrator and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely
on any such decision and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release
to Parent from the Escrow Fund a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the
Losses set forth in such decision (or as much of the Escrow Amount as is then
available in the Escrow Fund in the event such Losses exceed the then
available balance of the Escrow Fund). Should the amount held in the Escrow
Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount to be paid to a
Parent Indemnified Party in accordance with such decision, then, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VII, each Company Indemnitor shall,
within ten (10) Business Days following the date of such decision, pay to the
Parent Indemnified Party, such Company Indemnitor's Pro Rata Share of such
shortfall.

(e) Subject to the limitations contained in Section 7.3, including Section
7.3(c), the Escrow Amount shall be available as partial security to compensate
the Parent Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses
suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under
this Article VII. Any Losses that are agreed or determined pursuant to this
Article VII to be indemnifiable ("Indemnifiable Losses") and which are
recovered from the Escrow Amount shall come (A) with respect to each Founder,
proportionally from the vested portion of the Escrow Amount that is not
subject to revesting and the unvested portion of the Escrow Amount that is
subject to revesting, in each case pursuant to such Founder's Joinder
Agreement, and (B) pro rata from the cash and stock portion of the Escrow
Amount. Indemnifiable Losses recovered from the Escrow Amount shall reduce the
portion of the remaining Escrow Amount attributable to each of the Company
Indemnitor in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares of the remaining
Escrow Amount, if any, and out of each such Company Indemnitor's portion of
the Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares in the same proportions as Escrow Cash and
Escrow Shares were deposited in the Escrow Account with respect to such
Company Indemnitor at the Closing (as set forth on the Allocation Schedule).
Each Company Indemnitor may elect, in his, her or its sole discretion, whether
to satisfy any shortfall between the amount of such Indemnifiable Losses and
the Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund in cash, in shares of
Parent Common Stock, or a combination thereof, which such shares to be valued
for these purposes at an amount equal to the Parent Common Stock Closing
Price. In furtherance of, and without limiting, the foregoing, in the event a
Founder is obligated to satisfy any such shortfall and such Founder still has
Revested Merger Consideration that has not yet vested, such Founder shall
satisfy such amount proportionally from the vested portion of the Founder's
Total Merger Consideration and the unvested portion of the Revested Merger
Consideration.

(f) On or before the third (3rd) Business Day after the Escrow Expiration
Date, Parent will notify the Securityholder Representative in writing of the
amount that Parent determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all
claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that have been
asserted in any Indemnification Claim Notice that was delivered to the
Securityholder Representative at or prior to 11:59 p.m. (California Time) on the Escrow
Expiration Date, but not resolved, at or prior to such time (each such claim a
"Continuing Claim" and such amount, the "Retained Escrow Amount"). Within ten
(10) Business Days following the Escrow Expiration Date, Parent and the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund an amount
in the aggregate equal to (i) the Escrow Amount as of the Escrow Expiration
Date (as reduced from time to time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement),
minus (ii) the Retained Escrow Amount to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Company Indemnitors (other than amounts payable in respect
of Employee Options) in accordance with their applicable Pro Rata Share of
such amount; provided, that the portion of such amount due in respect of
Employee Options shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to Parent and paid
by Parent or the Surviving Entity to the holders of Company Options in
accordance with their applicable Pro Rata Share of such amount through its
payroll processing system.

(g) Following the Escrow Expiration Date, after resolution and payment of a
Continuing Claim, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall deliver a
Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release
from the Escrow Fund an amount in the aggregate equal to (i) the Retained
Escrow Amount as of the date of such resolution and payment (as reduced from
time to time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), minus (ii) the amounts
that Parent determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy other
Continuing Claims (which amounts will continue to be held as the Retained
Escrow Amount) to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company
Indemnitors (other than amounts payable in respect of Employee Options) in
accordance with their applicable Pro Rata Share of such amount; provided, that
the portion of such amount due in respect of Employee Options shall be
distributed by the Escrow Agent to Parent and paid by Parent or the Surviving
Entity to the holders of Company Options in accordance with their applicable
Pro Rata Share of such amount through its payroll processing system.

(h) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that as a condition to
Parent's and Paying Agent's obligation to make any payments pursuant to
Section 7.4(f) or Section 7.4(g), the Securityholder Representative shall
first deliver to Parent an updated Allocation Schedule setting forth the
amounts payable to each Company Indemnitor in accordance with such section.
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon
the updated Allocation Schedule delivered by the Securityholder
Representative, including with respect to whether any individual Company
Indemnitor received the appropriate portion of any such distribution, and in
no event will Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any
of their Affiliates have any liability to any person on account of payments or
distributions made in accordance with the updated Allocation Schedule
delivered by the Securityholder Representative.

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any notice that is required to be
delivered to any Company Indemnitors pursuant to this Article VII shall be
deemed satisfied by delivery of such notice to the Securityholder
Representative and (ii) any notices required to be delivered by, or any
actions (other than any obligation to make, or right to receive, any payments)
that are required to be taken by, any Company Indemnitors pursuant to this
Article VII shall be satisfied by delivery by, or action taken by the
Securityholder Representative.

7.5 Third Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, Parent shall notify
the Securityholder Representative of such claim with an Indemnification Claim Notice (a "Third Party Notice"), and the Third Party Notice shall be
accompanied by copies of any documentation submitted by the third party making
such Third Party Claim (except that Parent may withhold from Securityholder
Representative such communications with its legal counsel to the extent that
legal counsel to Parent advises that providing such communication could result
in the loss of any attorney-client privilege or right under the work-product
doctrine of Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Party in respect of such
claim, after giving due consideration to any "community of interest" or
similar privilege, if any); provided, that no delay or failure on the part of
Parent in delivering a Third Party Notice shall cause any Parent Indemnified
Party to forfeit any indemnification rights under this Article VII except to
the extent that the Company Indemnitors are actually prejudiced by such delay
or failure. Upon receipt of a Third Party Notice, the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled (on behalf of the Company Indemnitors and at
their expense) to participate in, but not to control, determine or conduct,
the defense of such Third Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of and to settle any such claim and the
Securityholder Representative shall not be entitled to control any negotiation
of settlement, adjustment or compromise with respect to any such Third Party
Claim; provided, that except with the consent of the Securityholder
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of the right of any Parent Indemnified Party
to be indemnified with respect to such Third Party Claim or settlement or the
amount of any Losses relating thereto; provided, further, that the consent of
the Securityholder Representative with respect to any settlement of any such
Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the Securityholder
Representative shall have objected within thirty (30) days after a written
request for such consent by Parent. In the event that the Securityholder
Representative has consented to any such settlement, adjustment or compromise,
the Company Indemnitors shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Article VII to the amount of such settlement, adjustment or
compromise.

7.6 Securityholder Representative.

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Mergers, and the consummation of the Mergers, executing
a Joinder Agreement or participating in the Mergers and receiving the benefits
thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Mergers, each Company Indemnitor shall be deemed to have
approved the designation of, and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact for and on
behalf of the Company Indemnitors as of the Closing for all purposes in
connection with this Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and any other agreements ancillary hereto, including to give and
receive notices and communications, to authorize satisfaction of claims by
Parent, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take
all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing
or (ii) permitted by the terms of this Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement. The Securityholder Representative may resign at any
time upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the Company
Indemnitors. Such agency may be changed by the Company Indemnitors from time
to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent;
provided, that the Securityholder Representative may not be removed unless the
former holders of a majority of Company Capital Stock agree to such removal
and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of
Securityholder Representative may be filled by the former holders of a
majority of Company Capital Stock. No bond shall be required of the Securityholder
Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company
Indemnitors.

(b) Neither the Securityholder Representative nor any member of the Advisory
Committee (as defined in that certain engagement letter entered into between
the Securityholder Representative and certain of the Company Indemnitors in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Engagement
Letter")) shall incur liability of any kind with respect to any action or
omission by the Securityholder Representative or the Advisory Committee in
connection with their services pursuant to this Agreement, the Engagement
Letter, the Paying Agent Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement ancillary hereto, except to the extent resulting from the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholder Representative or
such member of the Advisory Committee, as applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, the preceding sentence shall not prejudice the Securityholder
Representative's right to indemnification from the members of the Advisory
Committee (in their capacity as Company Indemnitors) pursuant to the following
sentence. The Company Indemnitors shall, on a several and not joint basis and
based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Securityholder Representative and each member of the Advisory Committee
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, and out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") to the extent arising out of or in
connection with the Securityholder Representative's or the Advisory
Committee's execution and performance of this Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements ancillary hereto, in
each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that
in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Securityholder Representative or such member of the Advisory Committee, as
applicable, the Securityholder Representative or such member of the Advisory
Committee, as applicable, shall promptly reimburse the Company Indemnitors the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly
to the Securityholder Representative by the Company Indemnitors, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholder Representative
from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund Account and (ii) any other funds that
become payable to the Company Indemnitors under this Agreement at such time as
such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company Indemnitors;
provided, that while this section allows the Securityholder Representative to
be paid from the aforementioned source of funds, this does not relieve the
Company Indemnitors from their obligation to promptly pay, in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares, such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
shall the Securityholder Representative be required to advance its own funds
on behalf of the Company Indemnitors or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability
or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company Indemnitors set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to the Securityholder Representative under this section.
The Company Indemnitors acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities
shall survive the resignation or removal of the Securityholder Representative
or the termination of this Agreement. (c) Upon the Closing, Parent shall wire to an account of Securityholder
Representative as set forth on the Allocation Schedule (the "Expense Fund
Account") an amount of $200,000 in cash (the "Expense Fund"), which shall be
used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Securityholder
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement,
Escrow Agreement and any other agreements ancillary hereto. The Company
Indemnitors shall not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholder Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable for any loss
of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder Representative
shall hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, shall not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and shall not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable after the completion of the Securityholder
Representative's responsibilities, the Securityholder Representative shall
deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Company Securityholders the portion of such balance
payable pursuant to Section 1.7(a), Section 1.7(b)(i) and Section 1.7(c), as
applicable; provided, that as a condition to Parent's and Paying Agent's
obligation to make such payments, the Securityholder Representative shall
first deliver to Parent an updated Allocation Schedule setting forth the
portion of such Expense Fund distribution payable to each Company Indemnitor.
For tax purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received
and voluntarily set aside by the Company Indemnitors at the time of Closing.
Any tax required to be withheld with respect to the deemed payment to a
Company Indemnitor of its portion of the Expense Fund shall reduce the amount
of cash to such Person at Closing in respect of Company Capital Stock and
shall not reduce the Expense Fund.

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.7 hereof, in accordance with the authority granted to
the Securityholder Representative hereunder shall constitute a decision of the
Company Indemnitors and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Company Indemnitors. Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Company Indemnitors. Parent is hereby relieved
from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative.

7.7 Treatment of Payments. Any payment under Article VII of this Agreement
(other than Section 7.6(c)) shall be treated by the parties, including for
U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes, as a purchase
price adjustment unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

unless otherwise specified. The meaning assigned to each term defined herein
shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such

"extent" and the phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall mean
the degree to which a subject or other things extends, and such word or phrase
shall not merely mean "if." Dollar thresholds shall not be indicative of what

counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually
executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and signature pages by
email in .pdf or .tif format (and including, without limitation, any

Agreement as to the parties hereto and may be used in lieu of the original
Agreement for all purposes. Such execution and delivery shall be considered
valid, binding and effective for all purposes.

9.4 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, the

entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (b) except as set

Person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (c) shall not be assigned by

9.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

agreed that any extension or waiver signed by the Company shall be binding
upon and effective against all Company Indemnitors whether or not they have
signed such extension or waiver, subject to the authority granted to, and to
the limitations thereon placed on, the Securityholder Representative hereunder
to act on behalf of such Company Indemnitors.

9.7 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time by execution and delivery of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the party against whom enforcement is sought,

stockholders of the Company shall not (a) alter or change the amount or kind
of consideration to be received on conversion of Company Capital Stock or (b)
alter or change any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if such
alteration or change would materially and adversely affect the holders of
Company Capital Stock. For purposes of this Section 9.7, the Company
Indemnitors agree that any amendment of this Agreement signed by the
Securityholder Representative shall be binding upon and effective against the
Company Indemnitors whether or not they have signed such amendment (subject to
the authority granted to, and to the limitations thereon placed on, the
Securityholder Representative hereunder to act on behalf of such Company
Indemnitors), except that any amendment made in accordance with this sentence
shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be
received on conversion of Company Capital Stock or (ii) alter or change any of

a manner adverse to any Accredited Investor or any Permitted Transferee
without the prior written consent of the affected Accredited Investor or any

performance of such covenant, obligation or other agreement and to an
injunction preventing or restraining such breach or threatened breach, and
(ii) no party hereto shall be required to provide or post any bond or other
security or collateral in connection with any such decree, order or injunction
or in connection with any related Legal Proceeding. 9.9 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise set forth herein, including in Section
1.15 and Section 7.3(g), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon
a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

9.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction).

COURT OF CHANCERY (OR APPELLATE COURT THEREOF LOCATED WITHIN SUCH COUNTY)
LACKS JURISDICTION OVER THE MATTER, THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA LOCATED WITHIN NEW CASTLE COUNTY IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE (OR
APPELLATE COURT THEREOF LOCATED WITHIN SUCH COUNTY), AND EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH
LEGAL PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY
MAIL TO SUCH PARTY'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF
PROCESS FOR ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO
PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY
SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

9.12 Post-Closing Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration. Subject to Section
9.11, any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the
interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof, shall
(except as specifically set forth in this Agreement) be finally settled by
binding arbitration held within San Francisco County, State of California in
accordance with the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to
grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial
proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute.

(a) Selection of Arbitrator(s). Such arbitration shall be conducted by one
arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Securityholder Representative.
In the event that, within fifteen (15) days after submission of any dispute to
arbitration, Parent and the Securityholder Representative cannot mutually
agree on one arbitrator, then, within ten (10) days after the end of such
fifteen (15) day period, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall
each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. If the Securityholder Representative fails to select an
arbitrator during this ten (10) day period, then the parties agree that the
arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by Parent. If Parent
fails to select an arbitrator during this ten (10) day period, then the
parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator
selected by the Securityholder Representative. (b) Arbitration Expenses; Discovery. The arbitrator (or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as applicable) shall determine how all expenses relating to
the arbitration shall be paid, including, the respective expenses of each
party, the fees of the arbitrator(s), and the administrative fee of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator (or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as applicable) shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator(s)
to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrator(s) determine that discovery was sought without
reasonable justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
reasonable justification.

(c) Decision. The decision of the arbitrator (or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as applicable) as to any claim or dispute shall be final,
binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision
shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and
conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, order awarded by the
arbitrator(s).

(d) Other Relief. The parties to the arbitration may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without
breach of this arbitration provision and without abridgement of the powers of
the arbitrator(s).

9.13 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
