Fargo Bank N.A. Shareholder Services is acceptable, for the payment of the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. Substantially
concurrently with the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of such shares to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and, except as provided in _Section
3.5_, the Dissenting Shares) cash constituting an amount equal to the Total
Common Merger Consideration (such Total Common Merger Consideration as
deposited with the Paying Agent, the " **Exchange Fund** "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 3.1(b)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Nothing contained in
this _Section 3.2_ and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder
of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ and (ii) applied
promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. Except as
provided in _Section 3.2(d)_ or _Section 3.2(f)_, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
3.1_.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the
form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instruction shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to Merger Closing.

 



 

(c) _Surrender Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent,

 



      
 

 



 

together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, and the
Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied
by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to _Section 3.5_, until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon
the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the applicable former shareholders of the Company one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with
respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
directed by Parent.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Equity Awards and Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options; Performance Units; Restricted Shares; Restricted
Share Units_.

 



 

(i) _Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised as of the date of this Agreement and immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), shall be canceled
without any action on the part of any holder of such Company Option in
consideration for the right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the Option Cash Payment.
For purposes of this Agreement, " **Option Cash Payment** " means, with
respect to any such Company Option, a cash payment equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price payable per share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company
Option, less any applicable withholding Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, any
such Company Option for which the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) without
payment of any additional consideration to the holder thereof.

 



 

(ii) _Company Performance Units_. As of the Effective Time, each Performance
Unit that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any action on the part
of any holder of such Performance Unit in consideration for the right at the
Effective Time to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the Performance Unit Payment. The " **Performance Unit
Payment** " means, with respect to any such Performance Unit, a cash payment
equal to the product of (A) the number of vested Performance Units as of the
Effective Time (after taking into account change in

 



      
 

 



 

control or other vesting provisions in the Company Plans and the award
agreements governing the applicable Performance Units) multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes.

 



 

(iii) _Company Restricted Shares; Restricted Share Units_. As of the Effective
Time, each Company Restricted Share and each Company Restricted Share Unit
that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled in full and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancellation, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, a cash payment equal to the Merger Consideration, less any applicable
withholding Taxes (the " **Restricted Award Payment** ").

 



 

(iv) _Certain Actions_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(v) _Manner of Making Payment_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation
sufficient cash funds to make all Option Cash Payments, all Performance Unit
Payments and all Restricted Award Payments, in each case, as required pursuant
to this _Section 3.3(a)_ and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make
such payments to all holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Share
Units, Performance Units and Company Restricted Shares, as applicable, as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in any event, within
five (5) Business Days thereafter.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such customary
and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 302A.471 of the MBCA,
and who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal
rights under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " **Dissenter s Rights**"),
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_, but instead the holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to the payment of the fair value
(including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with its Dissenters Rights. In
such case, at the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to

 



      
 

 



 

have any rights with respect thereto, except with respect to Dissenters
Rights and as provided in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
otherwise waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal
under the Dissenters Rights or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the
Dissenters Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Dissenting Shares under the Dissenters Rights shall cease and
such shares shall no longer be considered Dissenting Shares for purposes
hereof and such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as provided in
_Section 3.1(b)_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any demands
for appraisal by any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received by
the Company relating to the Dissenters Rights, and, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by
an order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle any such demands.
Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be returned
by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand; _provided_ , that Parent shall
remain liable to pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, the Merger
Consideration with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock covered by
the third sentence of _Section 3.5(a)_.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Withholdings_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the Option Cash Payment, the Performance Unit Payment and the
Restricted Award Payment, as applicable, and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance Units or Company
Restricted Share Units, or any other Person, such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, reasonably
determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer following the Effective Time,
they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable merger
consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_, for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.

except, in the case of any Subsidiary of the Company, where the failure to be

would not be material and adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, and (b) is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do
business, and (to the extent applicable) is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or

Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of the Company (the " **Charter** ") and Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company (the " **Bylaws** "), in each case, as most recently
filed with the Company SEC Documents, are, in each case, true, complete and

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) except as would not constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect, all Company Options and other equity-based
awards under the Company Plans have been granted in compliance with the terms
of the applicable Company Plans, with applicable Laws, and with the applicable

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining, at the Shareholders
Meeting, the approval of the Merger and the adoption of the Plan of Merger by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of

transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (other than, with
respect to the consummation of the Merger, the receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Approval, as well as the filing of the Articles of Merger with the

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representation in _Section 5.12_, the

series of the Companys capital stock or other securities of the Company
necessary under the Charter and Bylaws and by Law (including the MBCA) for the
Company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 



 

Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or the Companys performance of its
obligations hereunder will (i) subject to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder
Approval, conflict with or violate the Charter or Bylaws, (ii) assuming the
consents, registrations, filings, notices, approvals and authorizations
specified in _Section 4.4(b)_ have been obtained or made and the waiting
periods referred to therein have expired, and any condition precedent to such
consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been satisfied, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
or affected or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, result in the loss or impairment of rights under, or give to others any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien, other than any Permitted Lien,

 



      
 

 



 

upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
party or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), any such violation, breach, default, right, termination, amendment,
acceleration, cancellation or Lien that would not constitute a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
consummation by the Company of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or the Companys performance of its
obligations hereunder will require any consent, approval, authorization,
waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority, except pursuant to (i) the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or
state securities or "blue sky" Laws, (ii) the HSR Act and any other applicable
U.S. or non-U.S. Laws intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions or
transactions having the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraint of
trade, harm to competition or effectuating foreign investment, including
Council Regulation No. 139/2004/EC of the European Community, as amended ("
**Foreign Antitrust Laws** " and, together with the HSR Act, " **Antitrust
Laws** "), (iii) the MBCA and the filing of appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (iv) Gaming Laws, (v) the rules of the NASDAQ, and
(vi) such other consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, filings or
notifications, the failure of which to have, make or obtain, as applicable,
would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts or circumstances with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates insofar as such Affiliate-owned interest
would be attributable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
applicable Gaming Law, that would prevent or materially delay receipt of any
Gaming Approvals.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Permits and Licenses_. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals, findings
of suitability and orders of or from a Governmental Authority (including all
authorizations under Gaming Laws) necessary for the Company and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their respective assets and carry on
their respective businesses as it is now being conducted (the " **Company
Permits** "), other than those Company Permits with respect to which the
failure to possess would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
_Section 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and
complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all material Company
Permits. Except, individually or in the aggregate, as would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(i) all such Company Permits are in full force and effect and (ii) none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries is in default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) or violation of any such Company Permit. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice since October 31, 2010
from any Governmental Authority threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw,
modify or limit, in each case, in any material and adverse respect, any
Company Permit. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no circumstances or conditions providing grounds for any
suspension, revocation or withdrawal of any Company Permit other than (a) as
would not reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (b) to the extent resulting from, directly or indirectly, (i) the
negotiation, execution or announcement of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the impact of any of the foregoing on
relationships with customers, suppliers, licensors, employees or regulators
(including any Gaming Authority)) or (ii) changes, effects, developments or
circumstances to the extent arising from or relating to the identity of Parent
or Merger Sub or Parents ability to obtain the Gaming Approvals.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Compliance with Laws_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and have not
received written notice of any default or violation of, any Laws (other than
Gaming Laws) applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective business or operations or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected, in each case except
for instances of noncompliance, default or violation that would not constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and have not
received written notice of any material default or violation of, any Gaming
Laws applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any
property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or

Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and
(to the extent applicable) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in
each case, where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) would not
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The organizational or governing
documents of Parent and Merger Sub (collectively, the " **Parent
Organizational Documents** "), which, with respect to Parent, as are most
recently filed with the SEC and with respect to Merger Sub, as provided to the
Company, are, in each case, true, complete and correct copies of such

consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and the Debt Financing, have been duly and validly

this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by

Financing, any Lien required or permitted thereunder) on any property or asset
of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or
credit agreement, or any other Contract or other instrument or obligation to
which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any
property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such violations, breaches, defaults, rights,
terminations, amendments, accelerations, or cancellations which would not
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and the Debt Financing,
or performance of their obligations hereunder will require any consent,

is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against either Parent or Merger Sub as would constitute a Parent Material

Merger Sub (both before and after giving effect to any "market flex"
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements):
(x) have no reason to believe that, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2(a)_, _Section 7.2(b)_
and _Section 7.2(d)_ and the completion of the Marketing Period, they will
not be able to satisfy on a timely basis each term and condition relating to
the closing or funding of the Debt Financing; and (y) know of no fact,
occurrence, circumstance or condition that, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2(a)_, _Section 7.2(b)_
and _Section 7.2(d)_ and the completion of the Marketing Period,would
reasonably be expected to (1) cause any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated or
rescinded or to be or become ineffective, or (2) otherwise cause the full
amount (or any portion) of the funds contemplated to be available under the
Debt Commitment Letters to not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on a
timely basis (and in any event as of the Merger Closing). Parent and/or Merger
Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits
required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ ,
_Section 7.2(a)_ , _Section 7.2(b)_ and _Section 7.2(d)_ , the aggregate
proceeds from the Debt Financing, when taken together with the Parents and
its Subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents, constitute all of the financing
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and are sufficient in amount to provide Parent with the funds
necessary for Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, including for Parent to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate Option Cash Payments, the
aggregate Restricted Award Payments, the aggregate Performance Unit Payments
and the aggregate amount of any repayment or refinancing of debt, if any,
contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters and the payment
of all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees and expenses
relating to the Debt Financing (such amounts, collectively, the " **Required
Payment Amount** ").

 



 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no and, except as consistent
with _Section 6.11_, there will not be any conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the obligation of any party to any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing

 



      
 

 



 

Agreements to fund or invest, as applicable, the full amount (or any portion)
of the Debt Financing, including any condition or other contingency relating
to the availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any "market flex"
provisions, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the " **Disclosed Conditions** ").
Other than the Disclosed Conditions, no Financing Source or other Person has
any right to impose, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
Subsidiary obligor have any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to
any funding of the Debt Financing nor any reduction to the aggregate amount
available under the Debt Commitment Letters (nor any term or condition which
would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Commitment Letters). As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters and (except for the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements) there are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with any Lender, Financing Source or
other Person relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters
that could adversely affect the availability of the Debt Financing. Other than
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters delivered to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent
relating to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing that would,
or could reasonably be expected to, (i) impair the validity of the Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing,
(iii) prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iv) cause any Debt Commitment Letters to be ineffective, or (v)
otherwise result in the Debt Financing not being available on a timely basis
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) Except with respect to the Persons set forth in _Section 5.7(f)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
entered into any contract, agreement or understanding (i) awarding any agent,
broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on
an exclusive basis in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
(ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other
potential provider of debt financing, from providing or seeking to provide
debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in connection with
a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement,
the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent.
Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior to the date
of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing).

 



 

Section 5.9 _Gaming Approvals and Licensing Matters_. Since June 30, 2008,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their
respective officers, directors, or Affiliates, any existing beneficial owner

under the Debt Commitment Letters, in each case who or which

 



      
 

 



 

will be required to be licensed or found suitable under applicable Gaming Laws
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, has ever been denied a gaming license,
approval, or related finding of suitability by any Gaming Authority, or had
any gaming license or approval revoked or suspended. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or circumstances
with respect to Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates
insofar as such Affiliate-owned interest would be attributable to Parent or
Merger Sub under any applicable Gaming Law, that would prevent or materially
delay receipt of any Gaming Approvals.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger,
the shares of capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, for its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a
view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section 2(11) of the
Securities Act) thereof. Parent understands that the shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation have not been registered under the Securities Act
and cannot be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or
an exemption from such registration is available.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is Solvent as of the
date of this Agreement and, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligations to consummate the Merger, each of (x) the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in each case, on a consolidated basis, will,
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing and the payment of the
Required Payment Amount, be Solvent, at and immediately after the Effective
Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Solvent** " means that,
as of any date of determination and with respect to any Person: (i) the sum of
the debt (including contingent liabilities) of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not exceed the present fair saleable
value of the present assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; (ii) the capital of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is not unreasonably small in relation to the business of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) such Person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, do not have or intend to incur debts including current
obligations beyond their ability to pay or refinance such debts as they mature
in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , for the purposes
hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed
as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at
such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an
actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such contingent
liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 5).

 



 

Section 5.12 _MBCA Section 302A.671; Ownership of Company Securities_.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor or any affiliate or associate of either of
the foregoing, is, nor at any time during the last four (4) years has either
Parent or Merger Sub, or any affiliate or associate of either of the
foregoing, been, an "interested shareholder" of the Company as defined in
Section 302A.011 of the MBCA. Parent and its Subsidiaries, affiliates and
associates do not beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or
other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to
acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic
interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.13 _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments,
agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys
management or the Company Board or any of the Companys Affiliates, on the
other hand, relating in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Brokers_. Other than Goldman Sachs and Co. and Groton Partners,
each of whose fees and expenses shall be borne solely by Parent, no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger and any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 5.15 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article V_, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other
Person on behalf of any of them makes any express or implied representation or
warranty (and there is and has been no reliance by the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives on any such representation or warranty) with
respect to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses or with respect
to any other information provided, or made available, to the Company or any of
its Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the accuracy or completeness thereof.

than forty (40) calendar days after the date of this Agreement), the Company
shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy
statement relating to the Shareholders Meeting (together with any amendments
or supplements thereto, the " **Proxy Statement** "). Except as expressly
contemplated by _Section 6.5(c)_ or _Section 6.5(e)_, the Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the parties
hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts so that the Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such

 



      
 

 



 

document or response, and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions, or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel.

 



 

(b) _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement,
including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement,
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or
supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Shareholders Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(c) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company, in
consultation with Parent, shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date),
(x) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting of its
shareholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " **Shareholders 
Meeting**"), (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable following such record
date, mail (or cause to be mailed) to the holders of Company Common Stock as
of the record date established for the Shareholders Meeting a Proxy Statement
(such date, the " **Proxy Date** ") and (z) commence a broker search pursuant
to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company
shall duly call, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company, in its reasonable judgment and following consultation with Parent,
shall determine the length of any period for the solicitation of proxies from
its shareholders and, furthermore, that the Company may postpone, recess or
adjourn the Shareholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for
the absence of a quorum or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary or advisable under applicable Laws and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by
the Companys shareholders prior to the Shareholders Meeting. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Shareholders Meeting, the
Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
for the Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Bylaws. Unless the Company
Board shall have effected a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with
the Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws
and all rules of the NASDAQ. The Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to the first sentence of this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of
any Change in Recommendation.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the
Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors,
is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, such party shall promptly inform the others, and the Company shall
promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of the Company. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or
misleading.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.3(b)_, each of the parties

all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the

from, or to avoid a suit, action, proceeding or investigation by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger; _provided_ , that, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty

authorization in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, under any Contract other than _de minimis_
amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed substantially
simultaneously by Parent, (iii) vigorously defend or contest any claims,
lawsuits, actions or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or

or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, (iv) oppose any request
by any Governmental Authority or any other person for any divestiture, hold
separate condition, or any other restriction with respect to any assets,
businesses, or product lines of either Parent or the Company, provided,
however, that Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the limitations on Antitrust
Divestiture Actions set forth in Section 6.3(b), shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Merger closes before the Termination Date and to
eliminate any impediments thereto, and (v)

 



      
 

 



 

execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Merger and any other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the general obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under
_Section 6.3(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub agree to promptly take, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to take, and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, including _Section 6.1_, the Company
and its Affiliates shall be permitted to take (without affecting any
representation, warranty, covenant or condition in this Agreement), any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain
all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental
Authority so as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, as promptly as practicable, including
(i) committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders,
trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets or businesses (or
agreeing to change or modify any course of conduct regarding future operations
or otherwise taking actions that would limit its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of their respective
businesses, product lines, divisions or assets or interests therein), (ii)
terminating, relinquishing, modifying, or waiving existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective Subsidiaries and (iii) creating any relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter, or
offer to enter, into agreements and stipulate to the entry of an order or
decree or file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, by consenting to such action by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such action may be conditioned upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) (each an " **Antitrust Divestiture Action**
"), as are required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order, that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to take or agree to take any
Antitrust Divestiture Action if, (aa) as a result of such Antitrust
Divestiture Action, Parent, the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries would be foreclosed, precluded, or prohibited from, or in any way
limited in, producing, marketing, selling, offering for sale, deriving any
revenue from or otherwise owning all or any portion of the Companys iGaming
assets (including social gaming content and other iGaming assets) if such
Antitrust Divestiture Action would reasonably be expected to have a material
impact on the iGaming business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (bb) as a result of
such Antitrust Divestiture Action, Parent, the Company, or their respective
Subsidiaries would be foreclosed, precluded, or prohibited from, or in any way
limited in, producing, marketing, selling, offering for sale, deriving any
revenue from or otherwise owning the assets (including intellectual property
assets or licenses), categories of assets, subsidiaries, affiliates, or
businesses that are currently utilized or planned to be utilized by the Parent
or its Subsidiaries for either (A) each of the Companys and Parents
respective proprietary iGaming platforms or (B) each of the Companys and
Parents respective proprietary remote gaming servers or (cc) in the
aggregate, the Antitrust Divestiture Action would exceed the "Detriment
Limit." For purposes of this Agreement, (x) an Antitrust Divestiture Action
would exceed the Detriment Limit if the assets, businesses or product lines
required to be

 



      
 

 



 

divested or held separate (the " **Divestment** ") in order to obtain actions
or non-actions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of
waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals under Antitrust Laws
accounted for more than $35,000,000 of gross revenues, on a consolidated
basis, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2012 and (y) revenues
associated with any Divestment of all or any portion of the Companys iGaming
business shall not be counted towards the Detriment Limit. The Company and its
Affiliates hereby agree to take all necessary steps to achieve any Antitrust
Divestiture Action requested by Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_
, that, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall not take, any such action which would bind the
Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of any matter if the Merger Closing
does not occur. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Parent will not take
any actions that would preclude, impair or delay the consummation of the
Merger. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly (and, in the case of the HSR
Act, in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the date that
this Agreement is executed) make and not withdraw an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Law, and thereafter promptly make any other required submissions
under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law, in each case, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing or anything else in this
_Section 6.3_, each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting periods, or
receipt of required authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act and any
other Antitrust Law as soon as practicable. The transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be deemed to be materially delayed if unresolved
objections or suits delay or would reasonably be expected to delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
beyond the Termination Date.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the general obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under
_Section 6.3(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub agree to promptly take, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to take, and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, including _Section 6.1_, the Company
and its Affiliates shall be permitted to take (without affecting any
representation, warranty, covenant or condition in this Agreement), any and
all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain
all licenses, approvals and consents under any Gaming Laws that may be
required by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the parties to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as
promptly as practicable, including taking any and all steps necessary to (i)
as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, obtain all
licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations, registrations, findings of
suitability, franchises, entitlements, waivers and exemptions issued by any
Gaming Authority required under applicable Gaming Laws to permit the parties
hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
necessary to permit Parent to acquire, own and operate the Company
(collectively, " **Gaming Approvals** "); (ii) make or cause to be made all
necessary filings, and thereafter make or cause to be made any other required
submissions with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, as required under the Gaming Laws; (iii)
schedule and attend (or cause to be scheduled and attended) any hearings or
meetings with Gaming Authorities to obtain the Gaming Approvals as promptly as
possible; (iv) comply with the terms and conditions of any and all of the
foregoing as necessary to obtain the Gaming Approvals; and (v) avoid any
action or proceeding by any Gaming Authority challenging the consummation of

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and its Representatives and
Affiliates shall (A) file or cause to be filed (x) (i) with respect to the
Required Gaming Approvals, within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of
this Agreement and (ii) with respect to all other Gaming Approvals, within
forty-five (45) calendar days after the date of this Agreement, all required
initial applications and documents in respect of officers and directors and
Affiliates in connection with obtaining the Gaming Approvals (including in all
such cases, where appropriate indications of further information to come by
supplementary filing) and (y) as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement all other required applications and documents in connection
with obtaining the Gaming Approvals, (B) request or cause to be requested an
accelerated review from the Gaming Authorities in connection with such filings
(if applicable), (C) act diligently and promptly to pursue the Gaming
Approvals, (D) cooperate with the Company in connection with the making of all
filings referenced in the preceding sentence, (E) promptly notify the Company
of receipt of material comments or material requests from any Gaming Authority
that relate to Gaming Approvals and supply the Company with copies of all
correspondence (other than to the extent privileged) between Parent or any of
its Representatives and Affiliates and any Gaming Authority with respect to
Gaming Approvals and (F) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of Parents application for Gaming Approvals and its activities related
to obtaining the Gaming Approvals, as applicable, including promptly advising
the Company upon receiving any communication from any Gaming Authority that
causes Parent or Merger Sub to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood
that any Gaming Approval required from such Gaming Authority will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable Law, each of the parties hereto will furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any required filings or
submissions with any Governmental Authority and will cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing
the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement (other than private or personal information pertaining to any
individual applicants which may remain confidential). Neither party shall have
any material communication or meeting (telephonic or in-person) regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with a Governmental Authority
without giving the other party a reasonable opportunity to attend in person or
by phone (unless the Governmental Authority prohibits such other partys
participation or attendance in the communication or meeting); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to direct the
antitrust defense of the Merger in any investigation or litigation by, or any
negotiation regarding any antitrust issues or proposed remedies with, any
Governmental Authority or any other person seeking to challenge the Merger and
the Company shall (x) not make any offer, acceptance, or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental
Authority with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment
or remedy, timing agreements, or, in the event of litigation, discovery,
admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except as specifically
requested by or agreed with Parent, and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to
provide full and effective support of Parent and Merger Sub in all material
respects in all such negotiations and discussions to the extent requested by
Parent and Merger Sub.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, subject to the
reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and its
authorized Representatives (x) reasonable access during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice from Parent to their respective properties,
assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may
reasonably request, (y) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws, and (z) such
financial and operating data (including Tax Returns filed and those in
preparation and the workpapers of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
auditors) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
provide access to, or cause its Subsidiaries to provide access to, or disclose
(a) any information or documents which would (in the reasonable judgment of
the Company) be reasonably likely to (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
violate any applicable Laws, (iii) unreasonably disrupt the businesses and
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) breach any
agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Third Party;
_provided_ , that each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any required consents and take such other reasonable action (such as
the entry into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of
attorney-client privilege) to permit such access or disclosure; or (b) if the
Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto. All information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and the parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to comply with,
all of their respective obligations thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.5_, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, directly or indirectly, the making
of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) engage in negotiations or substantive
discussions with, or furnish any material nonpublic information to, any Third
Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal, other than informing Third Parties
of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and
(B) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the date that the Requisite Shareholder Approval is obtained
at the Shareholders Meeting, in the event that the Company receives a written
Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal, the Company and the Company Board and their Representatives may
engage in negotiations or substantive discussions (including, as a part
thereof, making counterproposals) with, or furnish any information and other
access to, any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives or potential sources of financing if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors, and based on information then available, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) prior to furnishing
any material nonpublic information, the Company receives from such Third Party
an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) any such material
nonpublic information so furnished has been previously provided or made
available to Parent or is provided or made available to Parent substantially
concurrently with it being so furnished to such Third Party.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company Board shall
not (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose to withdraw (or so modify), the Company Board Recommendation or (B)
adopt a formal resolution approving, adopting or recommending any Acquisition
Proposal, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
**Change in Recommendation** ") or (ii) approve or allow the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or similar
definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with
any Third Party relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an " **Alternative
Acquisition Agreement** "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the directors
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Without limiting _Section 6.5(c)_, in response to a written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(d)_ and, concurrently with such
termination, may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section
6.5(d)_ unless the Company (x) has complied with its obligations set forth in
_Section 6.5(e)_, and (y) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_, (x) unless the Company shall have provided
to Parent five (5) Business Days prior written notice (the " **6.5(e)
Notice**") advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action
(and (unless a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement has been
provided to Parent) specifying, in reasonable detail, the material terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third Party
making any such Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement, and (y):

 



 

(i) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to implement
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments to
this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other
agreements contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent (the "
**Proposed Changed Terms** ") no later than 5:00 p.m., Las Vegas time, on the
fifth (5th) Business Day of such five (5) Business Day period and shall have
determined (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisors) that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

(it being understood that any material revision or amendment to the terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new 6.5(e) Notice and, in such case,
all references to five (5) Business Days in this _Section 6.5(e)_ shall be
deemed to be two (2) Business Days).

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
of receipt) advise Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company
receives any Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such notice, provide
to Parent the material terms and conditions (excluding the identity of the
Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects on a timely basis of the status and details (including, within
twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence thereof, any material change to
the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal, including furnishing
copies of any material written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under applicable Law or in compliance with or
otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Companys shareholders), and
to the extent referred to therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys shareholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys shareholders) or (iii) making any disclosure
not of the type provided in clauses (i) or (ii) above to the Companys
shareholders that is reasonably required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosures permitted under this _Section 6.5(g)_ shall
not, in themselves, constitute a Change in Recommendation or form a basis for
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any bona fide proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) from a Third Party
relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
(based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Company
Board); (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity
investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Company
Board); (iii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any
Person of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock; or (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person
beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company Common
Stock or any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
(based on fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Company
Board).

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal (the
references to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)") made by a
Third Party on terms that the Company Board determines, in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors,
and considering such factors as the Company Board considers to be appropriate
(including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of consummation of
such proposal), are more favorable to the Company and its shareholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after giving effect to all
Proposed Changed Terms).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification (and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto)
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as
provided in the Charter or Bylaws (or such equivalent organizational or
governing documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date of this Agreement) or in any Contract between such Indemnitee and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with
respect to (x) all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any

 



      
 

 



 

time at or prior to the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arises out of or pertains to the Merger, this Agreement and any
transactions contemplated hereby, in either case, to the fullest extent
permitted by (i) the Charter or Bylaws (or such equivalent organizational or
governing documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date of this Agreement), (ii) any indemnification agreement of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or other applicable Contract as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnitees or (iii) applicable Law. Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director,
officer and employee liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnitees
than those set forth in the Charter and Bylaws and the Companys Subsidiaries
organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions
thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, to the fullest
extent the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will pay in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of a
written affirmation by the Indemnitee of a good faith belief that the criteria
for indemnification set forth in MBCA Section 302A.521 subd. 2 have been
satisfied and a written undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any
Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company shall
or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancelable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "
**D andO Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement. If such "tail" prepaid

 



      
 

 



 

policy has been obtained by either the Company or the Surviving Corporation
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that
is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6 _applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. To the fullest extent the Company would
have been permitted to do so under applicable Law, Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.6_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Charter or Bylaws (or
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries), certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation, under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.6_ and use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that a Person no less financially viable than the Surviving Corporation (in
the event the Effective Time occurs) remains responsible for the obligations
of such party under this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company, upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any notice, complaint, investigation
or hearing (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated)
from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any written notice of any Person
(other than a Governmental Authority) alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened in writing
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) any material change, effect,
development or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
a failure of a condition precedent in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of the
Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereunder and any failure to make such notification
(in and of itself) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of the Company) and
_Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent) have been satisfied or give rise to any
right of termination to any party hereto under _Article VIII_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release(s) announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, any other press release or other public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective
Affiliates) shall issue any such press release or make any such other public
announcement prior to such consultation, except that no such consultation
shall be required to the extent otherwise provided by this Agreement or with
respect to any disclosures as may be required by Law, Order, court process,
the applicable rules of the NASDAQ or the NYSE or any listing agreement with
the NASDAQ or the NYSE. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
(i) the Company will no longer be required to consult with Parent in
connection with any such press release or public announcement if the Company
Board has effected any Change in Recommendation or shall have resolved to do
so and (ii) the requirements of this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any
disclosure by Company or Parent of any information concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with any dispute between
the parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _U.S. Continuing Employees_.

 



 

(i) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees
of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who are located in the United
States (" **US Company Employees** ") a base salary or wage rate at least
equal to the US Company Employees base salary or wage rate in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and other compensation and benefits
that are, in the aggregate, comparable to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall honor, fulfill and discharge, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge, the Companys and its
Subsidiaries obligations under any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with
the terms thereof as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for benefit accrual
other than determining the level of paid time off and severance pay accrual)
under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
respective Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any US
Company Employees after the Merger Closing (the " **New Plans** "), each US
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company (including any predecessor), the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Merger Closing, to the same extent as such US Company
Employee was entitled, before the Merger Closing, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall US Company Employees be entitled to service credit to the extent
such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each US Company Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such US Company Employee participated
immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any US
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under a
Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _International Continuing Employees_. Except as may otherwise be required
by applicable Law, for the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective
Time, the employment of the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries of
the Company located outside of the United States shall continue with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof on terms and conditions of
employment, including compensation and benefit plans and arrangements
(including vacation policies, retirement benefits, health, welfare and fringe
benefits, and any severance or similar arrangements), that are, in the
aggregate, comparable to those provided by Parent to similarly situated
employees of Parent, or such other terms and conditions of employment as may
be required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any continuing employee, any beneficiary or dependents
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
any right of employment (including, without limitation, the compensation,
terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be provided to any
continuing employee by the Parent or Surviving Corporation or under any
benefit plan that the Parent or Surviving Corporation may maintain) or any
other legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature. Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall amend, or be deemed to amend, any
benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Company Benefit
Plan, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to, or
does, constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any benefit plan of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any continuing
employee any right with respect to continued employment by the Parent or
Surviving Corporation, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of
the Parent or Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any
continuing employee at any time, with or without cause, following the
effective date of his or her employment with the Parent or Surviving
Corporation or, subject to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.9_,
restrict the Parent or the Surviving Corporation in the exercise of its
independent business judgment in modifying any of the terms and conditions of
the employment of the continuing employees.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Merger Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take or agree to take any action
(including entering into agreements with respect to any acquisitions, mergers,
consolidations or business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the receipt of the Antitrust Approvals or the Required Gaming
Approvals.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that at any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any Person under, any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
cooperation provided pursuant to _Section 6.12_ and that Parent and Merger
Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing at or prior
to the Merger Closing and to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions, taken as a whole (including the flex provisions)
described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including executing and delivering
all such documents and instruments as may be reasonably required thereunder
and using (and causing their Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to:

 



 

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, negotiate
and enter into Financing Agreements with respect thereto (and maintain such in
effect and comply with the terms thereof) on the terms and conditions
contained therein (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance
with the terms of any "flex" provisions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters (including as specified in any Fee Letter provided pursuant to
_Section 5.7_)) or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to
Parent and would not adversely affect (including with respect to timing,
taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability
of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall any of the
Financing Agreements: (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
provided for in the Debt Commitment Letters (including by changing the amount
of fees or original issue discount contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters) in a manner that would adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Parent to consummate the Merger; (B) expand, amend or modify any of
the conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, or impose any new or additional condition
to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing, in each case that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Merger Closing or
the availability of the Debt Financing as of the Merger Closing; (C) contain
terms (other than those terms expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the date on which the
Debt Financing would be obtained; or (D) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the Financing Sources;

 



 

(ii) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfy,
or cause their Representatives to satisfy, as promptly as practicable and on a
timely basis, all conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements relating thereto (including by
paying any commitment, engagement or placement or other fees that become due
and payable under or with respect to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements);

 



 

(iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "market flex"
provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements;

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) assuming the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
provided for in the Debt Commitment Letters (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes Alternative Financing, if any, that is being used in
accordance with _Section 6.11_, pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) or any Financing Agreements related thereto have been satisfied
(other than (x) any conditions that are within the control of Parent or Merger
Sub and (y) those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Merger Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied), enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements in the event of a breach by the
Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements
relating thereto;

 



 

(v) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto, cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at or prior to the time the
Merger Closing is required to occur pursuant to the terms and conditions
hereof; and

 



 

(vi) deliver as promptly as is reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, the confidential information memoranda contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters to the Financing Sources.

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition, remedy or other provision under any Debt Commitment Letter or
any Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company if
such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount), from that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner adverse to Parent or the Company,
(iii) increase the amount of the Debt Financing or decrease the amount of
Equity Financing, in each case, from the amounts set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters delivered on the date of this Agreement, (iv) make it less
likely that the Debt Financing would be funded (including by making the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur) or otherwise
prevent or delay or impair the ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub
to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (v) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or
(vi) otherwise contravene the limitations set forth in _Section
6.11(b)(i)(A)-(D)_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to the
withdrawal, repudiation, termination or rescission of any Debt Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreement or any provision thereof without the prior
written consent of the Company. Upon any amendment, supplement or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section
6.11(c)_, Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references
herein to "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such documents as amended,
supplemented or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.11(c)_ and
references to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters as amended, supplemented or modified in compliance
with this _Section 6.11_ and the financing contemplated by the Financing
Agreements entered into in compliance with this _Section 6.11_, as
applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) or
from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing
Agreements for any reason or any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded
for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly so notify the Company and (ii)
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any
event no later than the Merger Closing Date), and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources (the " **Alternative Financing** ") in an amount
sufficient to replace such unavailable Debt Financing), and to obtain a new
financing commitment letter (including any associated engagement letter and
related fee letter) with respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively,
the " **New Debt Commitment Letter** "), copies of which shall be promptly
provided to the Company (with customary redactions with respect to the fee
letter). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no New Debt Commitment Letter may
expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Merger Closing as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters in effect on the date of this Agreement or otherwise include terms
(including any "flex" provisions) that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event any Alternative
Financing is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into in
accordance with this _Section 6.11(d)_, (i) any reference in this Agreement
to "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letters" (or defined terms
that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter
(and any related Fee Letter) to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter (or related new Fee Letter), as the case may be, at the time
in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter (and any related new Fee
Letter) to the extent then in effect.

 



 

(e) Any breach of the Debt Commitment Letters by Parent or Merger Sub shall be
deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section 6.11_. Parent shall (i) furnish
the Company (A) drafts of the Financing Agreements following the reasonable
request of the Company and (B) complete, correct and executed copies of the
Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company
prompt written notice of any default, breach or threatened breach by any party
of any of the Debt Commitment Letters or, to the extent such breach or default
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially hinder, or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Financing Agreements of which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates becomes aware or any termination or threatened
termination thereof and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any Alternative
Financing). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
give the Company prompt (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notice
(I) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any default or breach) of the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent
becomes aware, (II) of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other
communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or
potential breach of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letters by Parent or
Merger Sub, or any default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of
the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or

 



      
 

 



 

other agreements relating to the Debt Financing or (y) any dispute or
disagreement between or among parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing
or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Merger Closing and
(III) if at any time for any reason Parent believes that it will not be able
to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or will be unable to obtain
Alternative Financing. Parent shall promptly provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance disclosed
pursuant to clause (I), (II) or (III) of this subsection (e).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Merger Closing.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.11(a)_ and the remaining provisions of this
_Section 6.12_, prior to the Merger Closing, the Company shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense, reasonably cooperate with
Parent in connection with Parents arrangement of the Debt Financing, which
cooperation by the Company shall consist of, at the reasonable request of
Parent, (i) furnishing Parent with the financial information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries required by clause (ii) of paragraph (e) of
Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letters (for the avoidance of doubt, giving
effect to the last sentence of such paragraph (f)) (the " **Required Financial
Information** "), _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that
such information shall not include, and Parent shall be solely responsible
for, the preparation of pro forma financial information, including pro forma
cost savings, synergies, capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired
to be incorporated into any pro forma financial information, (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to cause its senior officers to be available, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt
Financing, (iii) using reasonable best efforts, upon Parents prior written
request, to furnish Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Merger
Closing with reasonable documents or other information relating to the Company

the Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2011,
(iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in obtaining
accountants comfort letters from the Companys independent accountants on
customary terms and consistent with the accountants customary practice in
connection with the Debt Financing, (v) using reasonable best efforts to

and its Subsidiaries assets and operations that is reasonably requested by
Parent, (vi) using reasonable best efforts to obtain attorney audit response
letters reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings similar to
the Debt Financing, (vii) providing requested authorization letters to the
Financing Sources (including with respect to absence of material non-public
information about the Company and its Subsidiaries and their securities in the
public-side version of the documents distributed to prospective lenders),
(viii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials
for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and

 



      
 

 



 

similar documents customarily required in connection with debt financings,
(ix) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide any customary payoff or
similar letters in connection with any debt facilities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates being terminated in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (x) agreeing to enter
into such agreements and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
such officers certificates, as are customary in financings of such type and
otherwise grant liens on, the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to such agreements as may be reasonably requested; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the Effective
Time. Parent shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon any private placement memoranda or
similar documents, or any materials for rating agencies, that include
information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prepared in
connection with the Debt Financing, and Parent shall include in such
memoranda, documents and other materials, comments reasonably proposed by the
Company. Following Parents request, the Company will update the Required
Financial Information so that such Required Financial Information remains in
compliance with GAAP (except in the case of the unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q or other rules or regulations of the SEC) and does not
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to (A) pay any commitment or other similar fee, (B) incur any liability of any
kind (or cause their respective Representatives to incur any liability of any
kind) prior to the Effective Time, (C) enter into any binding agreement or
commitment in connection with the Debt Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time and
does not terminate without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
upon termination of this Agreement, or (D) take any action that would (I)
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (II) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to
be breached, (III) cause any director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (IV) conflict with
the Charter, the Bylaws (or similar organizational documents of any of the

or that could reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or
a default under, any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, (VI) provide access to or disclose information that the Company
determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (VII) prepare separate financial statements for any
Subsidiary of the Company or change any fiscal period, or (VIII) authorize any
corporate action prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses and costs (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives in connection with any cooperation contemplated by this
_Section 6.12_. The Company, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the " **6.12 Indemnitees** ") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Parent for and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation), interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred, directly or indirectly, by the 6.12 Indemnitees in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or any Alternative
Financing), any refinancing of indebtedness contemplated

the Companys cooperation with respect thereto. This _Section 6.12(b)_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time and any
termination of this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced
by, the 6.12 Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors, estates,
personal representatives, successors and assigns, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent. All nonpublic or other confidential
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries obtained by
Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.12_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, such
logos are used solely in a manner that is reasonable and customary for such
purposes that does not suggest that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
any responsibility for the documents or materials in which such logos are used
(or the contents thereof) and that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
products, services, offerings or Intellectual Property Rights.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_, as it applies to the Companys
obligations under this _Section 6.12_, shall be deemed satisfied if (i) the
Companys breach(es), if any, of its obligations under this _Section 6.12_
did not cause the failure of the Debt Financing to be obtained or (ii) Parent
does not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ as a result of any breaches of this _Section 6.12_ by the Company.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Merger Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to comply with this Agreement, perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, in each case, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or
incur or guarantee any indebtedness or liabilities.

 



 

Section 6.14 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
operations.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and Parent shall take such further actions, if any, as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities
of the Company (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent
common stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent common
stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, will be exempt under Rule 16b-3

withdrawn ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to asserting this condition,
the party asserting this condition shall have used its reasonable best efforts
(in the manner contemplated by _Section 6.3_) to prevent the entry of such
Restraint and to appeal as promptly as possible any judgment that may be
entered).

remaining representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article
IV_ of this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and at and as of the Merger Closing Date as if made on the Merger
Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),

giving rise to which would not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect
(it being understood that, for purposes of clause (ii) above, when determining
the accuracy of such representations and warranties, all materiality, "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifiers contained in such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded);

all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it on or prior to the Merger Closing Date;

 



 

(c) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated the Merger

circumstances giving rise to which would not constitute a Parent Material
Adverse Effect;

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by them on or prior to the Merger Closing Date; and

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Requisite Shareholder Approval is
obtained (except as otherwise expressly noted), as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company; or

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

 



 

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on May 15, 2014 (the " **Termination Date** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ , _Section
7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not have been satisfied (or, with respect
to the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ only, duly waived by all
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions) by the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the Termination Date, then either the Company or Parent
may, by written notice delivered to the other party, unilaterally extend the
Termination Date from time to time to a date not later than July 10, 2014; in
which case, the Termination Date shall for all purposes be deemed to be the
date provided in such notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to either party if its action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach or violation of any of its covenants, agreements or other
obligations hereunder and such material breach or violation has been the
principal cause of or directly resulted in (1) the failure to satisfy the
conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the Termination Date (as the same
may be extended) or (2) the failure of the Merger Closing to occur by the
Termination Date (as the same may be extended); _provided_ , _further_ , that
the parties agree that neither Parent nor the Company shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ during the
pendency of a legal proceeding by the other party for specific performance
pursuant to _Section 9.9_; or

 



 

(ii) any Restraint shall be in effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, and, if such Restraint is an Order, such

 



      
 

 



 

Restraint shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have complied with its obligations under _Section 6.3_ to
prevent, oppose or remove such Restraint; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party, and in the case of
Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub, to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the Requisite Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a
duly held Shareholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;
or

 



 

(c) by the Company if:

 



 

(i) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ and (B) (I) is not capable of being cured prior to the Termination
Date or (II) is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub on or before the earlier of
(x) the Termination Date and (y) the date that is thirty (30) days following
the receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company of such breach or
failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have a right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if the Company
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) the Company Board has determined to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and
subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 6.5(d)_ and _Section
6.5(e)_, so long as concurrently with such termination, the Company (1) enters
into the associated Alternative Acquisition Agreement and (2) pays, or causes
to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee specified in _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_;
or

 



 

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Merger Closing), and Parent
or Merger Sub fails to consummate the Merger by the time the Merger Closing
should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(d) by Parent if:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
and (B) (I) is not capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date or
(II) is not cured by the Company on or before the

 



      
 

 



 

earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) the date that is thirty (30) days
following the receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent of such
breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

 



 

(ii) (A) the Company shall have failed to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to its stockholders, (B) a
Change in Recommendation has occurred, (C) the Company shall have breached or
failed to perform in any material respect any of its obligations set forth in
_Section 6.5_, (D) a tender offer or exchange offer that would, if
consummated, constitute an Acquisition Proposal shall have been commenced by a
Person unaffiliated with Parent and the Company shall not have published, sent
or given to its stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act,
within ten (10) Business Days after such tender offer or exchange offer is
first commenced within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, a statement recommending that stockholders reject such tender
offer or exchange offer and affirming the Company Board Recommendation, (E)
the Company shall have failed, following the public announcement of any bona
fide Acquisition Proposal (other than a Superior Proposal), to reaffirm
publicly the Company Board recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after
Parent requests in writing that such Company Board Recommendation under such
circumstances be reaffirmed publicly (which request may only be made (i) once
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent any material
modification to such Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, in which
case, Parent shall be entitled to make an additional request and (ii) on or
before 5:00 pm (New York) on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
initial public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal); provided, however,
to the extent such Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced within ten (10)
Business Days of the Shareholders Meeting, such affirmation shall be made not
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Shareholders Meeting, unless
such Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced within three (3) Business Days
of the Shareholder Meeting, in which case such affirmation shall be made prior
to such Shareholder Meeting, or (F) the Company or the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) shall formally resolve or publicly propose to take any of
the foregoing actions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall no longer be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_
once the Requisite Shareholder Approval has been obtained at the Shareholders
Meeting.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in
reasonable detail, and, except as set forth in this _Section 8.2_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no effect without
liability on the part of any party hereto (or any of its Representatives), and
all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if (x) such termination resulted, directly or indirectly,
from the breach of any covenant or other agreement contained herein or the
intentional breach of any representation or warranty contained herein or (y)
the breach of any covenant or other agreement contained herein or any
intentional breach of any representation or warranty contained herein shall
cause the Merger Closing not to occur, then, notwithstanding such termination,
such

 



       
 

 



 

breaching party shall be fully liable for any and all damages, costs, expenses
(including pursuant to _Section 9.13_), liabilities or other losses of any
kind, in each case, incurred or suffered by the other party (collectively, "
**Damages** ") as a result of such failure or breach; _provided_ , _further_
that the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of _Section 4.25_
(Brokers), _Section 5.14_ (Brokers), _Section 6.4_ (Access to Information;
Confidentiality) (last sentence only), _Section 6.11(a)_ (Financing),
_Section 6.12(b)_ (Financing Cooperation), _Article I_ (Definitions),

survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) _Termination Fee Payable_. If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated
by:

 



 

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, and (y)
the Company (A) receives or has received an Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party after the date of this Agreement, which Acquisition Proposal is publicly
disclosed and has not been withdrawn either (I) at or prior to the time of the
Shareholders Meeting or (II) prior to the termination of this Agreement if
there has been no Shareholders Meeting, and (B) within twelve (12) months of
such termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement to consummate, or consummates, a transaction regarding such
Acquisition Proposal with the Third Party, or any Affiliate of the Third
Party, who made such Acquisition Proposal described in clause (A) above, then
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent an amount equal to
$43,335,601 (the " **Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the
date of the consummation of such transaction regarding an Acquisition Proposal
( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the
references to "twenty five percent (25%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 



 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds concurrently with such termination; or

 



 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
following such termination.

 



 

(b) _Certain Limitations_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 9.9_, Parents right to receive payment from the

 



      
 

 



 

Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (collectively, the " **Company
Related Parties** ") for all Damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby (except that, to the extent any termination of this
Agreement resulted, directly or indirectly, from a breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or an intentional breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement by the Company or such
breach by the Company shall cause the Merger Closing not to occur as provided
under _Section 8.2_, Parent shall be entitled to both the payment of the
Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_) and to any
Damages, to the extent proven, in respect of such breach (as reduced by any
Termination Fee paid by the Company).

 



 

(c) _Integral Part of Transaction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee
is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iii) without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company
shall fail to pay or cause to be paid in a timely manner the amounts due
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ and in order to obtain such payment Parent makes
a claim that results in a judgment against the Company for payment of the
Termination Fee and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of
Parent, the Company shall pay to Parent Parents reasonable and documented
costs and expenses (including Parents reasonable and documented attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts due at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Shareholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such
further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified, or supplemented in any manner, whether
by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of
the parties in interest at the time of the amendment; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that _Section 9.5_ (solely with respect to the rights or benefits granted to
the Financing Sources therein), _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _9.7(a)(iii)_ , _Section 9.10(c)_, and _Section 9.12_ may not be amended
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may, by action taken or authorized
by its board of directors, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the proviso of the
first sentence of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or
condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power,
or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power hereunder. Any agreement on the part
of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The rights and remedies
of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 6.12(b)_, _Section 6.16_, _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, this
_Section 8.6_ and _Section 9.13_), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger, or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, is consummated, except that the expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC or in respect of the
HSR Act, in each case, in connection with the Merger (other than attorneys
fees, accountants fees and related expenses) shall be borne equally by Parent
and the Company.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions._

 



 

(a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto,

 



      
 

 



 

and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or information in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, shall be
deemed to be disclosure of such fact, circumstance or information with respect
to all other Sections of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent on
its face. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter relating to any
possible breach or violation of any contract or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence
of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

 



 

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in capitalized form in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and
neuter genders of such term.

 



 

(e) Any Law defined or referred to herein, or in any agreement or instrument
entered into or delivered in conjunction with the transactions contemplated
hereby and referred to herein, means such Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor Laws and the related regulations and published
interpretations thereof; _provided_ , that for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date
or dates, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law, as
amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case,
as of such date. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. The specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or _Article V_ is not
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not
material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party shall use the fact of
the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or controversy between or
among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Words describing
the singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa,
words denoting any gender shall be deemed to

 



      
 

 



 

include all genders and words denoting natural Persons shall be deemed to
include business entities and vice versa. When used in reference to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the term "material" shall be measured against the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(f) The words "made available to Parent" or words of similar import refer to
documents (x) posted to the Electronic Data Room or (y) delivered in Person or
electronically to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives. The phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date
hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to
July 15, 2013. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning
and effect as the word "shall," and vice versa. References to "$" or "dollars"
in this Agreement shall mean United States dollars.

 



 

(g) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law,
or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its permitted
assigns may assign its rights under this Agreement without the Companys
consent for collateral security purposes to any Financing Sources and/or any
of their Affiliates; and _provided_ , _further_ , in each case, that Parent
remains obligated to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, Annexes and Appendices hereto and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto)

 



       
 

 



 

constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in the event of Parents or
Merger Subs breach of this Agreement or fraud, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub; _provided_ , that this
clause is not intended and under no circumstances shall be deemed, to create
any right of the holders of Company Common Stock, the holders of Company
Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units, the holders of Company Options
and the holders of Performance Units to bring an action against Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, (viii) the provisions of
_Section 6.6_ (which shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees), (ix) the
provisions of _Section 6.10_ and (x) the provisions of _Section 6.12(b)_
(which shall be enforceable by the 6.12 Indemnitees).

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_
without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, Persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall
be governed by, and construed in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Minnesota or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Minnesota.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto (on behalf of themselves and the
third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in _Section 9.7_) shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The election
of any party hereto to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit such party from subsequently seeking to
terminate this Agreement and seeking to collect Damages in respect of any
breach pursuant to _Article VIII_.

 



 

(b) If, prior to the Termination Date, any party brings any action to
specifically enforce the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any
other party hereto, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by
(x) the amount of time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20)
Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action.

Agreement or the Debt Financing, and no Financing Party shall have any rights
or claims against any of the Company or any of its respective Representatives

bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way
