 (c) As of the Effective Time, all Outstanding Shares converted in accordance with this  _Section 2.3_ no longer shall be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing any such Outstanding Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The holders of such certificates previously evidencing Outstanding Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Outstanding Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by law and, upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.4_, shall only have the right to receive for each such share, the Merger Consideration, without interest. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with Amegy Bank N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") (i) that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to Thirty Five Million and No/100 United States Dollars ($35,000,000) divided by the Average Closing Price (the " _Escrow Shares_ "), _plus_ (ii) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) Per Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ (B) the Average Closing Price  _multiplied by_ (C) the number of Outstanding Shares held by Unaccredited Investors (the " _Escrow Cash_ ") _less_ (iii) that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) Per Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ (B) the number of Outstanding Shares held by Unaccredited Investors, which Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash (together, the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be held in escrow and distributed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement consistent with the terms of  _Article IX_ of this Agreement and otherwise mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") evidencing Outstanding Shares (collectively, the " _Stockholders_ "), but excluding Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to Parent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent reasonably may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled at Closing to receive from Parent in exchange therefor, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4(c)_: 

   

 (i) a certificate evidencing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (1) the Per Share Stock Amount _minus_ the Per Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ (2) the number of Outstanding Common Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount _multiplied by_ the number of Outstanding Common Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate; 

  

 (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_; and 

  

 (iv) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.4(d)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. 

  

 The shares of Parent Common Stock, cash, dividends, and distributions described in each of  _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ are referred to collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_." Such cash payable to the Stockholders shall be wired, in immediately available funds, to the account or accounts designated by the respective Stockholders in their respective letters of transmittal or, if requested by any Stockholder in its letter of transmittal, shall be paid by check. 

  

 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Outstanding Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate evidencing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock and cash may be issued and paid in accordance with this _Article II_ to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Shares is presented to Parent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for Escrow Shares, Parent shall issue any shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this  _Section 2.4(b)_ in registered book-entry form in accordance with the procedures of Parents transfer agent rather than certificated form unless otherwise requested by a Stockholder. 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures for Unaccredited Investors_. Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section 2.4(b)_, any Stockholder that does not certify that he, she or it is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") in this Agreement or in the letter of transmittal submitted to Parent or as to whom Parent otherwise reasonably believes is not an "accredited investor" (an " _Unaccredited Investor_ ") shall not receive any shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and shall receive cash in lieu thereof pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_. Upon surrender by an Unaccredited Investor of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall, in lieu of any shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would have had a right to receive, be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Stock Amount _minus_ the Per Share Escrow Amount  _multiplied by_ (ii) the Average Closing Price _multiplied by_ (iii) the number of Outstanding Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate. 

   

 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.

such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder
of certificates evidencing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash
payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_ and the amount

 (i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of the Outstanding Shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Outstanding Shares converted pursuant to _Section 2.3_ who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (A) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ (B) the Average Closing Price.

If any Certificate for Outstanding Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii) the execution and delivery of an agreement to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Company, and (iii) if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, then Parent shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Outstanding Shares formerly represented thereby.

    ##### 

  

     

such payment under the Code, or any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Outstanding Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving Company. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.

The Company shall take the necessary action to permit a holder of an outstanding stock option to elect to exercise such stock option by having withheld shares of stock that would otherwise have been issued upon such exercise to facilitate the payment of the exercise price and the employment taxes and required withholding taxes resulting from the exercise of the stock option. All grants of restricted stock under the 2008 Plan that are vested prior to or as of the Effective Time and all shares of stock received upon the exercise of stock options under the 2008 Plan that are exercised prior to or as of the Effective Time shall be Outstanding Shares as of the Effective Time.

    ##### 

  

     

DGCL and received by the Company in connection therewith and the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations with respect to any
such demand for appraisal. No later than ten (10) days following the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
provide notice of the Effective Time to each Stockholder who has
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and has
not withdrawn or lost the right to the appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to
any demand for appraisal or agree to settle any such demands. Parent may
elect, by notice to the Surviving Company, to make all payments required to
be made to holders of Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, Outstanding Shares that are held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who have demanded properly in writing and perfected the right, if any, for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such Stockholders shall only be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Outstanding Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Outstanding Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for only the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration, upon surrender in the manner provided in _Section 2.4_, of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Outstanding Shares. 

   

 Section 2.8 _Closing Date Debt_. With respect to any amount of Closing Date Debt that the Company is unable to repay in full as of the Closing Date as required by _Section 7.2(h)_ (after giving effect to the cash dividends expressly permitted in _Section 6.1(b)_), Parent shall cause the amount of such unpaid Closing Date Debt to be deducted from the Merger Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ and repaid in full; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that to the extent the Company does not have sufficient cash on hand to pay some or all of the Closing Date Debt outstanding under the Installment Sales Contracts with Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation identified at Item 7 on _Schedule 4.7_ as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the cash dividends expressly permitted in _Section 6.1(b)_ and the repayment of all other outstanding Closing Date Debt), such portion of the outstanding Closing Date Debt shall not be required to be repaid as of the Closing Date, shall remain outstanding and shall not be deducted from the Merger Cash Consideration (the " _Continuing Debt_ ").

Takeover Proposal (and such persons representatives) regarding such Takeover
Proposal.

 (d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.6(d)_, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) allow, cause or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement providing for or contemplating the consummation of any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as provided in _Section 6.6(b)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval the Board of Directors of the Company may take the actions set forth in _clause (i)(A)_ of this _Section 6.6(d)_, if such Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable laws.

 (e) _Severability_. If a judicial or arbitral determination is made that any of the provisions of this _Section 6.12_ constitutes an unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable restriction against the Principal Stockholders, the provisions of this _Section 6.12_ shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial or arbitral determination finds such provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable with respect to it. In this regard, the Parties hereby agree that any judicial authority construing this Agreement shall be empowered to sever any portion of the Territory, any prohibited business activity or any time period from the coverage of this _Section 6.12_ and to apply the provisions of this _Section 6.12_ to the remaining portion of the Territory, the remaining business activities and the remaining time period not so severed by such judicial or arbitral authority.

 (f) _Injunctive Relief_. The Principal Stockholders hereby acknowledge and agree that the remedies at law would be inadequate to protect the Company, its Subsidiaries and Parent against any actual or threatened breach of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.12_ by any of the Principal Stockholders, and that any such breach would cause irreparable harm, and, as such, the Principal Stockholders further agree that Parent shall be entitled to injunctive relief without making proof of actual damages. Such injunctive relief shall not be deemed exclusive remedies for any such breach, but shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies otherwise available to Parent. The Principal Stockholders agree that, in connection with any injunctive relief sought by Parent, any and all bonding requirements are hereby waived. In the event of any legal proceeding (whether at law or in equity) relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a Principal Stockholder has breached this 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement, then that Principal Stockholder shall be liable and pay to Parent
any costs in connection with such proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
including reasonable legal fees, and Parent shall be entitled to pursue the
recovery of all damages, losses and liabilities related to such breach. 

   

 (g) _Reasonable Restraint_. It is agreed by the Parties hereto that the foregoing covenants in this _Section 6.12_ are necessary in terms of time, activity and territory to protect the interests of Parent in the assets and businesses being acquired pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and impose a reasonable restraint on the Principal Stockholders in light of the activities and businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of the execution of this Agreement and the current plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 Section 6.13 _Tax Matters_. Subject to Article IX (including _Section 9._7), the following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Parent, Sub, the Company and the Principal Stockholders for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date: 

  

 (a) _Responsibility for Taxes_. 

   

 (i) As between Parent and each Affiliate of Parent and the Principal Stockholders, the Principal Stockholders shall be severally (based on each Principal Stockholders Ownership Percentage relative to the other Principal Stockholders) and not jointly liable for the following Taxes, without duplication and in accordance with and subject to the terms of _Article IX_, (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, to the extent such Taxes are for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or otherwise relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing. 

  

 (ii) Subject to the provisions of _Article IX_ (including, without limitation, the provisions of _Section 9.7_), the Principal Stockholders shall be liable for Taxes pursuant to _Section 6.13(a)_ or as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company pursuant to _Section 4.14_, but only to the extent such Taxes in the aggregate exceed the reserve for Tax liability (other than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Closing Date Balance Sheet (rather than by notes thereto) prepared by Parent in accordance with GAAP (the " _Tax Reserve_ "), except that the Tax Reserve on the Closing Date Balance Sheet will not include any increase in any Tax liability account established after June 30, 2009 for contingent Tax liabilities under FAS 5 or FIN 48. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree that (i) the Tax Reserves on the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall include an additional accrual for property taxes in the amount of $550,000 that was not reflected 

   ##### 

  

    

as a liability for such Taxes on the June 30 Balance Sheet, and (ii) for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall take into account
for purposes of calculating the Tax Reserve in accordance with GAAP all
deposits, advance payments and prepayments of Taxes, including any
Tax refunds (or credits in lieu of such refunds) attributable to any Tax
Returns for the taxable year ending December 31, 2008, made by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in the preceding
sentence shall be construed to limit the amount of property taxes that may be
accrued in the ordinary course of business and included in the Tax Reserves
shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet with respect to any period after June
30, 2009. 

  

 (iii) Within forty-five (45) calendar days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a schedule setting forth Parents determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") reflecting proper accruals for Taxes. From the Closing Date until the final determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Parent will provide the Stockholder Representative and its representatives with access, during reasonable hours and under reasonable circumstances, to the books and records, personnel and accountants of the Surviving Company as is reasonably necessary to prepare the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of Parents determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet during which to review Parents determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, and to notify Parent in writing of any dispute of any item contained in the Closing Date Balance Sheet, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such disputed items as promptly as possible. In the event Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve any disputed item within fifteen (15) calendar days following notice of such dispute, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each prepare a schedule setting forth its determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Stockholder Representatives determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Stockholders  Closing Date Balance Sheet_") shall include the Stockholder Representatives proposal regarding the disputed items that remain unresolved in accordance with the preceding sentence, and Parents determination of the Closing Date Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date (the " _Parent s Closing Date Balance Sheet_") shall include Parents proposal regarding such unresolved disputed items. The only differences between Parents Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall relate to the unresolved disputed items, it being understood that all other items shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties and no additional issues may be raised in connection with the preparation of such schedules other than such unresolved disputed items. The schedules reflecting Parents Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Stockholders Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be submitted to, and such disputed items shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm having appropriate expertise as selected in good faith by the mutual agreement of Parent and the Stockholder Representative as promptly as practicable (such firm, the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall cooperate with the Accounting Arbitrator and shall provide the Accounting Arbitrator access to such books and records as may be reasonably necessary to permit a determination by the Accounting Arbitrator. The Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve the disputed items solely by determining what it believes in its professional judgment to be the most accurate calculation of the amount of Closing Date Balance Sheet in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The decision by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their 

   ##### 

  

    

Reasonable Efforts to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of the
engagement of the Accounting Arbitrator. If at any time the Parties resolve
their dispute, then notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section
6.13(a)_, the Accounting Arbitrators involvement promptly shall be
discontinued and the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be revised, if
necessary, to reflect such resolution and thereupon shall be final and
binding on the Parties. All of the costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholders regardless
of whether the disputed items are settled by the Accounting Arbitrator or by
agreement of the Parties following the designation of the Accounting
Arbitrator. The determination and decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be final and nonappealable and shall be valid and binding upon the Parties
hereto and their successors and assigns and may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction. 

  

 (b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. 

   

 (c) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_ _._ The Principal Stockholders shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any consolidated (or combined) group of companies of which the Company is the common parent) that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date. For avoidance of doubt, the Principal Stockholders shall be responsible for the preparation of the statement required by IRS Notice 2009-4 related to information required under Treasury Regulation Section 1.351-3 with respect to the Companys U.S. federal income Tax Return for the year ending December 31, 2008. Parent shall be responsible for the preparation of any Tax Returns due from or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any consolidated (or combined) group of companies of which the Company is the common parent for the period ending on the Closing Date) that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect to the U.S. federal income Tax Return prepared by Parent for a Tax period that ends on the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a draft of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date, including extensions of time to file, therefor for review and comment. Parent shall consider in good faith any comments thereafter received from the Stockholder Representative, and make any changes reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative, with respect to such Tax Returns. Parent shall timely file such Tax Returns or cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed with the relevant Tax authority. 

   

 (d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. 

   

 (i) Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Principal Stockholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, 

   ##### 

  

    

in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns, including the
filing of the statement required by IRS Notice 2009-4 prepared by the
Principal Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the
provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries and the
Principal Stockholders agree (A) to the extent not delivered to the other
Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, to retain all books and
records in their possession or control with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Principal Stockholders, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to
give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party
so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Principal Stockholders,
as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such
books and records. 

  

 (ii) Parent and the Principal Stockholders further agree, upon request, to use their Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). 

  

 Section 6.14 _Rule 144 Reporting_. For the purpose of making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale of the Merger Stock Consideration to the public without registration, Parent agrees to use its Reasonable Efforts to meet the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act until the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 6.15 _Repayment of Related-Party Loans_. All receivables of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries or other amounts owing to the Company or its Subsidiaries by any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by any Stockholder or any Affiliate of the Company or any Affiliate of a Stockholder shall be paid in full prior to the Closing Date. All receivables of any director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of any Stockholder or any Affiliate of the Company or any Affiliate of a Stockholder or other amounts owing to any such Person by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than reasonable expense reimbursements in the ordinary course of business, shall be paid in full prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 6.16 _Termination and Release_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof and, in any event, prior to the Closing Date, Gregory shall cause the Lease Agreement by and between Gregory and Cook, Inc., as lessor, and Price Gregory Construction, Inc., as lessee, for the storage facility located at 2230 Genoa Red Bluff Road, Houston, Texas 77034 to be terminated, with the lessor executing a written release in favor of the Company and its Subsidiaries releasing each of them from all liability associated with such property and the lease and occupancy thereof, in a form that is reasonably satisfactory to Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.17 _Parachute Payments_. The Parties acknowledge that a portion of the payments and benefits to be provided to certain directors of the Company and Company non-union employees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code unless stockholder approval of such payments is obtained in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent (which review and approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld), the Company may seek such stockholder approval in such manner and the Company may take any and all actions reasonably necessary to secure such approval. On the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent an original, fully executed copy of all stockholder consents, if any, obtained pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 6.17_. 

  

 Section 6.18 _Voluntary Termination; Transition Services_. Each of Jackson and Beckelman shall be permitted to terminate their respective employment with the Company as of the Effective Time and such termination shall be deemed to be a voluntary termination for "Good Reason" as set forth in such individuals Existing Employment Agreement with the Company; _provided_  that, at the request of Parent, such individual shall agree to remain as a consultant to the Company for a reasonable transition period through no later than December 31, 2009 on reasonable and customary terms that do not cause such individual to fail to have a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.

the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to the Indemnified
Party its unqualified obligation to fully indemnify the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Article IX_. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying
Party (A) declines or fails to (1) assume the defense of the Action on the
terms provided above, (2) provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Party of its financial capacity to defend such Action and provide
indemnification with respect to such Action or (3) employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in any case within such ten-day period,
or (B) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Action and the
Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that a
conflict of interests exists that would make joint representation
inappropriate, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or
defend it in any such Action and the Indemnifying Party will pay the
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees
and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any single Action. In any Action with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such Action,
will have the right to participate in such matter and to retain its
own counsel at such Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, will at all times use Reasonable
Efforts to keep the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case
may be, reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any Action
the defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with
each other with respect to the defense of any such Action. 

   

 (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, (ii) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (iii) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates. 

   

 (c) A claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for any matter not involving an Action by a third party may be asserted by written notice to the Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification is sought. Such notice will specify with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party will establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the 

    ##### 

  

    

Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available
funds (or, if the Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, in
accordance with this _Article IX_) in an amount equal to such claim as
determined hereunder. 

   

 Section 9.4 _Claims Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Claims Period_ " shall be the period during which a claim for indemnification may be asserted under this Agreement by an Indemnified Party. The Claims Periods under this Agreement shall begin on the Closing Date and terminate as follows: 

  

 (a) with respect to any Parent Losses arising (i) under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_, (ii) under  _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ solely with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in _Sections 4.1_ (Organization), _4.2_ (Authorization), _4.3_  (Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures, and Investments), _4.4_ (Capitalization), _4.5_ (Absence of Restrictions and Conflicts; Consents), and _4.26_ (Brokers, Finders and Investment Bankers) (collectively, the " _Surviving Representations_ ") or (iii) under any of _Sections 9.1(a)(v)_ and _9.1(a)(viii)_ (collectively, the " _Surviving Obligations_ "), the Claims Period shall continue indefinitely, except as limited by Applicable Laws (including by applicable statutes of limitation) or as otherwise provided in _Section 9.4(d)_; 

   

 (b) with respect to Parent Losses arising under _Section 9.1(a)(vii)_, the Claims Period shall survive until 90 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; 

   

 (c) with respect to Stockholder Losses arising under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_, the Claims Period shall continue indefinitely, except as limited by Applicable Laws (including any applicable statutes of limitation); 

   

 (d) with respect to any Parent Losses asserted against SCF and arising (i) under _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_ solely with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in any of the Surviving Representations or (ii) under _Section 9.1(a)(viii)_, the Claims Period shall continue until December 31, 2015; and 

   

 (e) with respect to all other Parent Losses or Stockholder Losses arising under this Agreement, the Claims Period shall terminate on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. 

   

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Limits of Liability_. 

  

 (a) _Parent Basket_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent Indemnified Parties shall not assert a claim against the Principal Stockholders for indemnification under _Sections 9.1(a)(ii)_ or _9.1(a)(vi)_ for Parent Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of such Parent Losses exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Parent Basket_ ") and then the recoverable Losses shall be limited to those that exceed the Parent Basket;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , 

    ##### 

  

    

the any claim for breach of the Surviving Representations shall not be
subject to the Parent Basket and shall not count against the Parent Basket. In
addition, any claim by the Parent Indemnified Parties against the Principal
Stockholders for indemnification under _Section 9.1(a)(vii)_ or for breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in  _Sections 4.14_ (Tax
Returns; Taxes) shall not be subject to the Parent Basket unless it
is asserted after the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date (in which case such Parent Basket shall be reduced by the aggregate
amount of claims for Parent Losses under  _Sections 9.1(a)(ii)_ or
_9.1(a)(vi)_ made prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date). For purposes of calculating the amount of Parent Losses
incurred in respect of the Parent Basket, any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties shall be
ignored. 

   

 (b) _Maximum Liability_. The aggregate liability of each Principal Stockholder under  _Sections 9.1(a)(ii)_, _9.1(a)(iii)_ , _9.1(a)(iv)_ , _9.1(a)(vi)_ and  _9.1(a)(vii)_ shall not exceed the product of such Principal Stockholders Ownership Percentage and $35,000,000 (the " _Aggregate Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Aggregate Cap shall not apply to any Losses arising out of or resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of the Surviving Representations; and _provided further_ that the Aggregate Cap shall not apply to Losses related to an indemnity claim under the Combination Agreement as contemplated under _Section 9.5(c)(iii)_. Each Principal Stockholders aggregate liability under this _Article IX_ shall not exceed the Merger Consideration (including the Escrow Fund) received by such Principal Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Tax Indemnity_. The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(vii)_ with respect to any liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Taxes (i) except to the extent provided for in _Section 6.13(a)_, (ii) resulting from the failure of the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, or (iii) with respect to federal income Taxes, to the extent the Company is entitled to recover the amount of such federal income Taxes pursuant to Article XII of the Combination Agreement dated as of January 31, 2008 among the Company and each of the other parties thereto (the " _Combination Agreement_ "). 

   

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights of the Company or any other Person under the Combination Agreement, and none of the Parent Basket, the Aggregate Cap or any other limitation in this Agreement shall be applicable to any rights the Company or any other Person may have under the Combination Agreement. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. 

  

 (a) Except in the case of Fraud or criminal conduct (but only with respect to the Person against whom such Fraud or criminal misconduct claim is made and finally established and determined), if the Closing occurs, the monetary remedies set forth in this _Article IX_ and the specific performance remedy referenced in _Section 8.2_ shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies arising out of, in connection with, relating to or arising under this Agreement, any document, agreement, certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other laws or otherwise, including any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made herein or any other document contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto. In the event this Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of the 

    ##### 

  

    

Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties shall be as set forth
in _Section 8.3_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies
available in this _Section 9.6_ supersede (and each Party waives and
releases) any other remedies available at law or in equity including rights
of rescission, rights of contribution and claims arising under applicable
statutes. " _Fraud_ " means fraud as determined under common law as opposed
to fraud as defined by Texas Business and Commerce Code Section 27.01. 

   

 Section 9.7 _Escrow Fund_  

  

 (a) Parent shall cause the Escrow Fund to be deposited on the Closing Date with the Escrow Agent to be held in trust pursuant to the terms hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares shall be allocated to separate accounts maintained for each of the Stockholders that are not an Unaccredited Investor based on the number of Outstanding Shares held by such Stockholder  _multiplied by_ the Per Share Escrow Amount. The Escrow Cash shall be allocated to separate accounts maintained for each of the Stockholders that are an Unaccredited Investor based on the number of Outstanding Shares held by such Stockholder, _multiplied by_ the Per Share Escrow Amount _multiplied by_ the Average Closing Price. Prior to seeking payment directly from any Principal Stockholder for any indemnity claim under this _Article IX_, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall first seek to satisfy such claim from the Escrow Fund account maintained for such Principal Stockholder in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.7_ and the Escrow Agreement. To the extent the Escrow Fund account maintained for a Principal Stockholder is insufficient to pay the amount of any indemnity claim of any Parent Indemnified Party, each Parent Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article IX_, have the right to recover such amounts from such Principal Stockholder by any means allowed by Applicable Laws. 

   

 (b) If a Parent Indemnified Party asserts an indemnity claim under this _Article IX_ or an indemnity claim under the Combination Agreement as contemplated under _Section 9.5(c)_ during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "), the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Article IX_ by receiving from the Escrow Agent all or a portion of the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to the amount of such indemnity claim. For all purposes of this _Article IX_, the Escrow Shares shall be valued at the Average Closing Price, and such value shall be used for purposes of determining the amount of the liability of a Principal Stockholder for purposes of applying the Aggregate Cap of such Principal Stockholder, to the extent applicable. 

   

 (c) To the extent any Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to a distribution from the Escrow Fund as a result of an indemnity claim under _Sections 9.1(a)(ii)_,  _9.1(a)(iii)_ , _9.1(a)(vi)_ , _9.1(a)(vii)_ or _9.1(a)(viii)_ , such distribution of the Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be in Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash in amounts pro rata based upon the Ownership Percentage of each Stockholder. To the extent any Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to a distribution from the Escrow Fund as a result of an indemnity claim under _Sections_   _9.1(a)(i)_ , _9.1(a)(iv)_ or _9.1(a)(v)_ , such distribution of the Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be in Escrow Shares and shall be distributed solely from the account maintained for the specific Principal Stockholder that is the Indemnifying Party. To the extent any Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to assert an indemnity claim under the Combination 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement as contemplated under _Section 9.5(c)_, any distribution of the
Escrow Fund to such Parent Indemnified Parties shall be in Escrow Shares and
shall be distributed solely from the account maintained for the specific
Principal Stockholder that is an indemnifying party under the Combination
Agreement. 

   

 (d) All claims asserted by a Parent Indemnified Party during the Escrow Period that are not resolved and satisfied (including the obligation to pay any such indemnity claim) shall be deemed to be " _Pending Claims_." The dollar amount of all Losses claimed in good faith in respect of Pending Claims arising under _Sections 9.1(a)(ii)_, _9.1(a)(iii)_ ,  _9.1(a)(vi)_ , _9.1(a)(vii)_ and _9.1(a)(viii)_ are hereinafter referred to as the " _Stockholder Pending Claim Amount_ ," the dollar amount of all Losses claimed in good faith in respect of Pending Claims against a particular Principal Stockholder arising under _Sections 9.1(a)(i)_ , _9.1(a)(iv)_ and _9.1(a)(v)_ are hereinafter referred to as the " _Principal Stockholder Pending Claim Amount_ " and the dollar amount of all Losses claimed in good faith in respect of Pending Claims against a particular Stockholder arising under the Combination Agreement as contemplated under _Section 9.5(c)_ are hereinafter referred to as the " _Combination Agreement Pending Claim Amount_." On the first Business Day following the last day of the Escrow Period (the " _Release Date_ "), Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release and deliver to each Stockholder, in accordance with the terms of and in the manner set forth on such instructions, the Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash, as the case may be, then held in the account maintained for such Stockholder in excess of the sum of (i) the amount of any Stockholder Pending Claim Amount _multiplied by_ such Stockholders Ownership Percentage, (ii) the amount of any Principal Stockholder Pending Claim Amount against any such Stockholder that is a Principal Stockholder and (iii) the amount of any Combination Agreement Pending Claim Amount against any such Stockholder that is an indemnifying party under the applicable indemnification provision in Article XII of the Combination Agreement. An amount of the Escrow Fund equal in value to any Stockholder Pending Claim Amount, any Principal Stockholder Pending Claim Amounts and any Combination Agreement Pending Claim Amount, in the aggregate, as of the Release Date will continue to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement until such claim or claims have been fully resolved and the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to be extended accordingly. 

   

 (e) The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne 50% by the Stockholders and 50% by Parent. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Principal Stockholder Ancillary Documents or the Company Ancillary Documents to the contrary, each Stockholder shall have full voting rights with respect to the Escrow Shares held in the account maintained for such Stockholder during the period from the Closing Date unless and until such Escrow Shares are released to Parent from escrow pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.7_. 

   

 (g) To the extent requested by the Stockholder Representative, simultaneously with any instructions by Parent and the Stockholder Representative to the Escrow Agent in accordance with this _Section 9.7_ to release any Escrow Shares to the Stockholders, Parent shall cause the cancellation of certificated Escrow Shares and issuance of replacement certificated 

   ##### 

  

   

shares of Parent Common Stock to the Persons and in the denominations
requested in writing by the Stockholders prior to the issuance of such
instructions. 

   

 Section 9.8 _Investigations_. The respective representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered by any Party prior to the Closing and the rights to indemnification set forth in _Article IX_ will not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by a Party to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Compliance with Express Negligence Rule_. ALL RELEASES, LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNITIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THOSE IN THIS ARTICLE IX, SHALL APPLY IN THE EVENT OF THE SOLE, JOINT AND/OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS RELEASED, DISCLAIMED, LIMITED OR INDEMNIFIED. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Insurance Proceeds_. The Parent Losses and Stockholder Losses giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds or other payments actually received by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of any Losses giving rise to the claim for indemnification. Any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of Losses for which it intends to seek indemnification hereunder shall use Reasonable Efforts to collect any amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance policies; _provided_ that such obligation shall not delay or otherwise affect the timing or collection of any indemnity claim hereunder from the other Party. 

  

 Section 9.11 _DISCLAIMER_. THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND EACH PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE TO THE EXTENT NOT SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY COMPANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR ANY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER ANCILLARY DOCUMENT, AND EACH PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

  

ARTICLE X. 
 PARENT COMMON STOCK 

   

 Section 10.1 _Compliance with Law_. The Company and the Principal Stockholders acknowledge that the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Restricted Shares_ "), will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_ ") and therefore may not be resold without compliance with those Securities Laws. The Restricted Shares are being or will be acquired by the Stockholders solely for their own account, for investment purposes only, and with no present intention of distributing, selling or otherwise disposing of them in connection with a distribution. Each Principal Stockholder covenants, warrants and represents that none of the Restricted Shares will be, directly or indirectly, offered, sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, transferred or otherwise disposed of except after full compliance with all of the applicable provisions of the Securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities 

   ##### 

  

 

and Exchange Commission and any applicable state securities regulatory
authority. Certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall bear the
following legends: 

    

This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain
rights as set forth in an agreement between Quanta Services, Inc. and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent, dated as of March
8, 2000 and amended and restated as of October 24, 2002, as it may be amended
from time to time (the " _Agreement_ "), the terms of which are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the
principal executive offices of Quanta Services, Inc. Under certain
circumstances, as set forth in the Agreement, such rights (as defined in the
Agreement) will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be
evidenced by this certificate. Quanta Services, Inc. will mail to the holder
of this certificate a copy of the Agreement without charge after receipt of a
written request therefor. As set forth in the Agreement, rights
beneficially owned by any person (as defined in the Agreement) who becomes an
acquiring person (as defined in the Agreement) and certain transferees
thereof become null and void and are no longer transferable. 

   

These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or any state securities laws. They may not be sold or offered for
sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred in the absence of an
effective registration statement as to the securities under said Act and any
applicable state securities law or unless the company has received an opinion
of counsel satisfactory to the company that such registration is not required
to effectuate such transaction. 

  

 Parent agrees that it will cause new certificates without the legend in the second paragraph above to be promptly issued in exchange for the initially issued certificates upon the request of any Stockholder if such legend is not then required by Applicable Laws. 

  

 Section 10.2 _Economic Risk; Sophistication; Accredited Investors_. Each Principal Stockholder is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Restricted Shares and can afford to sustain a total loss of such investment. Each Principal Stockholder has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the proposed investment and therefore has the capacity to protect his own interests in connection with the acquisition of the Restricted Shares pursuant hereto. Each Principal Stockholder represents to Parent that it is an "accredited investor," as that term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. Each Principal Stockholder or his representatives have had an adequate opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the officers of Parent concerning, among other matters, Parent, its management, its plans for the operation of its business and potential additional acquisitions. Each Principal Stockholder acknowledges that Quanta has previously delivered to it/him or its/his representatives copies of Quantas 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 2, 2009, Quantas first quarter 2009 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on May 8, 2009 and Quantas second quarter 2009 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on August 10, 2009 and represents that it/he has had an adequate opportunity to carefully review such materials and any 

   ##### 

  

 

other information concerning Quanta that it/he deems necessary or appropriate
to evaluate the merits and risks of the proposed investment in Quanta Common
Stock contemplated herein. 

   

 Section 10.3 _Insider Trading_. The Principal Stockholders acknowledge that they, as well as personnel at the Company and its Subsidiaries, may become aware of "material nonpublic information" (as defined under applicable securities laws) regarding Parent and its Affiliates, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Principal Stockholders understand, and will communicate to persons having knowledge of any such information, that applicable securities laws prohibit trading in securities of Parent while in possession of material nonpublic information regarding this information and restrict the disclosure of such information to others.

 Section 11.2 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part of this Agreement as if set out in full in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.3 _Stockholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Stockholders hereby irrevocably appoints John E. Jackson (the " _Stockholder Representative_ ") as such stockholders representative, attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder, to act for and on behalf of such Stockholder to take any and all actions and make any and all decisions which under this Agreement as to which the Stockholder Representative is expressly authorized to act or make, including the power: 

   

 (i) to take any and all action necessary or desirable in connection with the waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Principal Stockholders to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) to receive on behalf of the Principal Stockholders notice of all indemnification claims by a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article IX_ and to notify all Principal Stockholders of any such claim and to take all actions in connection with such indemnifications claims as may be necessary or desirable; and 

  

 (iii) to give instructions to the Escrow Agent in connection with the release of the Escrow Fund as contemplated by _Section 9.7_. 

  

 Each of the Stockholders hereby consents to and confirms such appointment and the taking by the Stockholder Representative of any and all such acts and the making of any and all such decisions. Each of the Stockholders will be bound by any and all actions taken and any and all decisions made by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this _Section 11.3_ , and Parent and the Surviving Company will be entitled to rely on any such actions or decisions. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any act taken or omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement, except if taken or omitted in bad faith or by willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative will also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand, certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine (including facsimiles thereof). 

   

 (c) The Stockholders agree, severally but not jointly, to indemnify the Stockholder Representative for, and to hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative, arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representatives carrying out its duties under this Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully defending the Stockholder Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto. 

   

 (d) In the event the Stockholder Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue to serve in the capacity of Stockholder Representative, he may resign and be discharged from his duties and obligations as Stockholder Representative by giving his resignation to each of the Parties, specifying a date not less than ten days following such notice date of when such resignation will take effect and, in that event, Lee E. Beckelman will be deemed to be appointed by the Stockholders as the new Stockholder Representative and shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be the Stockholder Representative. In the event Lee E. Beckelman then becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his capacity as Stockholder Representative, he may resign and be discharged from his duties or obligations hereunder by giving his resignation to each of the Parties, specifying a date not less than ten days following such notice date of when such resignation will take effect. In that event, a majority-in-interest of the Stockholders will designate a successor representative prior to the expiration of such ten-day period by giving written notice to Parent. If the Stockholders have not appointed a successor Stockholder Representative and notified Parent of the identity and address of such successor Stockholder Representative within such ten-day period, Parent shall be relieved of the obligation to send notices to or obtain consents from the Stockholder Representative while there is no Stockholder Representative and, for purposes of this Agreement, in each such case, it shall be deemed that the Stockholder Representative has received the required notice and/or approved such action. At any time, a majority-in-interest of the Stockholders may remove the Stockholder Representative,  _provided_ that a successor Stockholder Representative is appointed at the same time. Until notified in writing by the Stockholder Representative that he has resigned or by the Principal Stockholders that the Stockholder Representative has been removed, Parent may rely conclusively and act upon the directions, instructions and notices of the last known Stockholder Representative and, after such notice, upon the directions, instructions and notices of any successor named in a writing executed by a majority-in-interest of the Stockholders received by Parent. 

   

 (e) The Stockholder Representative will not be entitled to receive any compensation from Parent, the Surviving Company or the Stockholders in connection with performing his functions as the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement.

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 11.4 _Assignment; Successors in Interest_. No assignment or transfer by any Party of its rights and obligations under this Agreement will be made except with the prior written consent of the other Party to this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior written consent of the Principal Stockholders, be entitled to assign this Agreement or all or any part of its rights or obligations hereunder to any one (1) or more Affiliates of Parent and, _provided further_ , that Parent (or any such Affiliate, if applicable) may pledge, assign and grant to Parents (or such Affiliates) lenders, for the benefit of such lenders, a continuing security interest and lien on all of Parents or such Affiliates right, title and interest in and to this Agreement and any and all related agreements, as security for the payment and performance of all obligations of Parent or such Affiliate to such Lenders by reason of borrowing or the guarantee of borrowing, or otherwise, but no assignment permitted by this _Section 11.4_ will relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement.

 Section 11.7 _Controlling Law; Amendment_. This Agreement (other than _Section 6.12_ ) will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Texas without reference to its choice of law rules.

 Section 11.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any action, suit or proceeding arising in connection with any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related document (for purposes of this _Section 11.8_, a " _Legal Dispute_ ") shall exclusively be brought in the courts of the State of Texas in Harris County, Texas or the federal courts located in the Southern District of the State of Texas.

from execution, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum or that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding
is improper. Each Party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any action,
suit or proceeding described in this _Section 11.8_ after the expiration of
any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during appeal shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Laws. THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE IRREVOCABLY ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY
DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR OTHERWISE RELATED HERETO. 

   

 Section 11.9 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the Parties waive any provision of Applicable Laws which renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect. 

  

 Section 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

 Section 11.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the right of each Stockholder to seek indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_, nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended, or will be construed, to confer upon or give any Person other than the Parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, or result in such Person being deemed a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.12 _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty will not be construed as a waiver of any other covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A waiver by any Party of the performance of any act will not constitute a waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be performed at a later time. 

  

 Section 11.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents executed pursuant to this Agreement supersede all negotiations, agreements and understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and constitute the entire agreement between the Parties.

other gender, and words in the singular form will be construed to include the

and incorporates all exhibits, schedules and other attachments thereto, (B)
includes all documents, instruments or agreements issued or executed in
replacement thereof and (C) means such document, instrument or agreement, or
replacement or predecessor thereto, as amended, modified or supplemented from
time to time in accordance with its terms and in effect at any given time.
The Parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained
herein will have independent significance. 

   

 Section 11.21 _Legal Representation of Stockholders_.
