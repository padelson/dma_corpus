  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

 

 

 

 

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of April 26, 2017, by and among TowneBank, a Virginia banking
corporation ("Towne"), TB Acquisition, LLC, a Virginia limited liability
company and wholly owned subsidiary of Towne ("Towne Merger Sub"),
Paragon Commercial Corporation, a North Carolina business
corporation ("Holding Company"), and Paragon Commercial Bank, a North
Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holding Company
("Bank Subsidiary").

 

 

 

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Towne, Holding Company and Bank
Subsidiary have approved, and deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders to consummate, the business
combination transactions provided for herein, including the merger of
Holding Company with and into Towne Merger Sub (the "Merger"), and the
merger of Bank Subsidiary with and into Towne immediately after the Merger
(the "Bank Merger" and, together with the Merger, the "Transaction");

 

 

 

 

 

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Towne, Holding Company and Bank
Subsidiary have each determined that the Transaction is consistent with, and
will further, their respective business strategies and goals; and

 

 

 

 WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that, for
federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code.

 

 

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

 

 

 

  ARTICLE 1

 

  The Transaction and Related Matters

 

 

 

 

 

1.1

 

The Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Date (as defined in Section 1.3(a), Holding Company will be
merged with and into Towne Merger Sub pursuant to the Plan of Merger in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and made a part hereof (the "Plan of
Merger"). The separate corporate existence of Holding Company thereupon shall
cease, and Towne Merger Sub will be the surviving entity in the Merger and
continue its existence after the Merger as a Virginia limited
liability company. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
Section 13.1-1070 of the Virginia Limited Liability Company Act
(the "VLLCA") and Sections 55-11-10(e) and 55-11-10(e1) of the North
Carolina Business Corporation Act (the "NCBCA").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.2

 

The Bank Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, immediately
after the Effective Date, Bank Subsidiary will be merged with and into Towne
pursuant to the Bank Plan of Merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
1.2 and made a part hereof (the "Bank Plan of Merger"). The separate
corporate existence of Bank Subsidiary thereupon shall cease, and Towne will
be the surviving corporation in the Bank Merger. The Bank Merger will have
the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation
Act (the "VSCA") and Section 55-11-06 of the NCBCA. The Bank Merger will
become effective on the date and at the time shown on the Articles of Merger
required to be filed with the office of the Virginia State Corporation
Commission, as provided in Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, and with the office
of the North Carolina Secretary of State, as provided in Section 55-11-05 of
the NCBCA, effecting the Bank Merger (the "Bank Merger Effective Date").

 

 

 

 

 

1.3

 

Effective Date; Closing.

 

 

 

 

 

(a)  The Merger will become effective on the date and at the time shown on
the Articles of Merger required to be filed with the office of the Virginia
State Corporation Commission, as provided in Section 13.1-1072 of the VLLCA,
and with the office of the North Carolina Secretary of State, as provided in
Section 55-11-10(d) of the NCBCA, effecting the Merger (the "Effective
Date"). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 6, the parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Effective Date to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after all
required regulatory and stockholder approvals to consummate the Merger have
been received, taking into consideration the date that Bank Subsidiary's data
processing systems are expected to be integrated with Towne's
data processing systems. At or after the Closing Date (as defined below),
(i) to effect the Merger, Towne Merger Sub and Holding Company will execute
and deliver Articles of Merger containing the Plan of Merger to the Virginia
State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Secretary of State, and
(ii) to effect the Bank Merger, Towne and Bank Subsidiary will execute and
deliver Articles of Merger containing the Bank Plan of Merger to the Virginia
State Corporation Commission and the North Carolina Secretary of State.

 

 

 

(b)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of
the Transaction will take place at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time at the corporate
office headquarters of Towne on a date mutually agreed to by the parties and
which shall be held at or before the Effective Date (the "Closing Date"). All
documents required by this Agreement to be delivered at or before
the Effective Date will be exchanged by the parties on the Closing Date.

 

  
 

 

 

 

1.4

 

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Towne.

 

 

 

 

 

(a)  The Articles of Incorporation of Towne as in effect immediately prior
to the Bank Merger Effective Date will be the Articles of Incorporation of
Towne at and after the Bank Merger Effective Date until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  Prior to the Bank Merger Effective Date, Towne shall take
all appropriate actions to adopt an amendment to the Bylaws of Towne
to increase the number of directors that may serve on the Board of Directors
of Towne to the extent necessary to accommodate the current directors of
Holding Company that will be appointed as directors of Towne as of the Bank
Merger Effective Date as contemplated by Section 1.5(a). The Bylaws of Towne
as may be amended pursuant to this Section 1.4(b) and in effect
immediately prior to the Bank Merger Effective Date will be the Bylaws of
Towne at and after the Bank Merger Effective Date until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable law.

 

 

 

 

 

1.5

 

Corporate Governance.

 

 

 

 

 

(a)  At the Bank Merger Effective Date, Towne shall cause each of Robert C.
Hatley and Howard Jung to be appointed to the Board of Directors of Towne to
serve in such capacity until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of
Towne following the Bank Merger Effective Date, and, subject to the good
faith consideration by the Nominating Committee of Towne's Board of Directors
of the selection criteria set forth in its charter, such persons shall be
nominated to sit for election by Towne's stockholders at such annual meeting
of stockholders.

 

 

 

(b)   At the Bank Merger Effective Date, Towne shall establish a TowneBank
Cary Board of Directors, a TowneBank Charlotte Board of Directors, and a
TowneBank Raleigh Board of Directors (collectively, the "TowneBank
NC Boards"). The TowneBank NC Boards shall initially be composed of the
current members of each of the advisory Boards of Directors established by
Holding Company for each of these regions, together with representatives from
the Boards of Directors of Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary, as
appropriate for each geographical region, and other business and community
leaders chosen by Towne after consultation with Holding Company.  Membership
on the TowneBank NC Boards shall be conditional upon execution of an
agreement providing that such person will not engage in activities
competitive with Towne until the later of the date that is two (2) years
following the Bank Merger Effective Date or the date on which he or she
ceases to be a member of any of the TowneBank NC Boards.

 

 

 

 1.6 Tax Treatment of the Transaction.

 

 

 The parties to this Agreement intend that the Merger constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Such
parties hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the final regulations
promulgated under the Code by the United States Department of the Treasury
(the "Treasury Regulations"). All parties hereto agree to cooperate and use
their best efforts in order to qualify the transactions contemplated herein
as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, to not take any
action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to so
qualify, and to report the Merger for federal, state, and any local income
Tax (as defined herein) purposes in a manner consistent with
such characterization.

Company Common Stock converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall no

(c)  Each certificate previously representing shares of Holding
Company Common Stock (a "Holding Company Common Certificate") and the non-

receive with respect to each share of Holding Company Common Stock (i) the
Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Holding Company
Common Certificate or Holding Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with Section 2.2, and (ii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6.

 

 

 

(d)  Each share of Holding Company Common Stock held by any party hereto and

third parties as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Date and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor; provided, that such

 2.2 Exchange Procedures.

 

 

 

(a)  On or before the Closing Date, Towne shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or
depository or trust institution of recognized standing approved by Towne (in
such capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the
Holding Company Common Certificates and the holders of Holding Company Book-
Entry Shares, at the election of Towne, either certificates representing the
shares of Towne Common Stock or noncertificated shares of Towne Common Stock
(or a combination) issuable pursuant to this Article 2, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and any cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares without any interest thereon (the
"Exchange Fund"), in exchange for the Holding Company Common Certificates
and Holding Company Book-Entry Shares.

 

 

 

(b)  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Towne shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder of record of Holding
Company immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use
in exchanging such stockholder's Holding Company Common Certificates or
Holding Company Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration, as
provided for herein.

 

 

 

(c)  Towne shall cause the Merger Consideration into which shares of Holding
Company Common Stock are converted at the Effective Date, and dividends or
distributions that a Holding Company stockholder shall be entitled to
receive, to be issued and paid to such Holding Company stockholder upon
proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of Holding Company Common Certificates
and Holding Company Book-Entry Shares representing such shares of Holding
Company Common Stock, together with the transmittal materials duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto. No interest
will accrue or be paid on any such cash to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.4
or 2.6.

 

 

 

(d)  Any Holding Company stockholder whose Holding Company
Common Certificates or Holding Company Book-Entry Shares have been
lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to
the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions to which
such stockholder shall be entitled upon compliance with
reasonable conditions imposed by Towne pursuant to applicable law and
as required in accordance with Towne's standard policy (including the
requirement that the stockholder furnish customary indemnity).

 

 

 

(e)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of Holding Company for twelve (12) months after
the Effective Date shall be returned to Towne (together with any earnings in
respect thereof). Any stockholders of Holding Company who have not complied
with this Article 2 shall thereafter be entitled to look only to Towne, and
only as a general creditor thereof, for payment of the consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Holding Company Common Stock such
stockholder held as of the close of business on the Effective Date as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 

 

 

(f)  None of the Exchange Agent, the parties hereto, the Towne Subsidiaries
(as defined herein) nor the Holding Company Subsidiaries (as defined herein)
shall be liable to any stockholder of Holding Company for any amount of
property delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3

 

Holding Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

 

 

 

 

 

(a)  At the Effective Date, each option (to the extent any are outstanding),
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Holding Company Common
Stock (a "Holding Company Stock Option") granted under an equity or equity-
based compensation plan of Holding Company (a "Holding Company Stock Plan")
or otherwise granted shall be converted into an option (each, a "Replacement
Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Holding Company Stock Option (except as provided otherwise in this
Section 2.3(a)), the number of shares of Towne Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject
to the Holding Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Such product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise
price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent) of each Replacement
Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of shares of Holding
Company Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such Holding Company
Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Holding Company Stock Option that is intended to be
an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted if necessary in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code, and all other options shall be adjusted if necessary in a manner
that maintains the option's exemption from Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

 

(b)  At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under
a Holding Company Stock Plan (a "Holding Company Stock Award") that is
unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Date shall cease, at the Effective Date, to represent any rights with respect
to shares of Holding Company Common Stock and shall be converted without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a restricted stock award
of Towne (a "Replacement Stock Award"), on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Holding Company Stock Awards (but taking into
account any changes thereto, including any acceleration of vesting thereof,
provided for in the Holding Company Stock Plan or in the related award
document by reason of the Merger). The number of shares of Towne Common
Stock subject to each such Replacement Stock Award shall be equal to
the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to the Holding
Company Stock Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest whole share of Towne Common Stock.

 

 

 

(c)  At the Effective Date, Towne shall assume the Holding Company
Stock Plans; provided that such assumption shall only be with respect to the
Replacement Options and Replacement Stock Awards, and Towne shall have no
obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the Holding Company
Stock Plans. The provisions of any such Holding Company Stock Plan will be
unchanged, except that (i) all references to Holding Company (other than any
references relating to a "change in control" (or similar term) of
Holding Company) in the Holding Company Stock Plan and in each
agreement evidencing any award thereunder shall be deemed to refer to
Towne, unless Towne reasonably determines otherwise, and (ii) the number of
shares of Towne Common Stock available for issuance pursuant to the Holding
Company Stock Plan following the Effective Date shall be equal to the number
of shares of Holding Company Common Stock so available immediately prior to
the Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
down to the nearest whole share of Towne Common Stock.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, Towne will deliver to
the holders of Replacement Options and Replacement Stock Awards any required
notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Holding
Company Stock Plan and award documents and stating that such Replacement
Options and Replacement Stock Awards have been issued by Towne and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger
and the terms of the Holding Company Stock Plan).

 

 

 

 2.4 No Fractional Shares.

 

 

 

 Each holder of shares of Holding Company Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of Towne Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Towne Common Stock multiplied by the
average closing price per share of Towne Common Stock, as reported on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending
on and including the fifth trading day prior to the Effective Date.

 

 

 

 

 

2.5

 

Anti-Dilution.

 

 

 

 

 

 In the event Towne changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of shares of Towne Common Stock issued and outstanding before the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction,
appropriate and proportional adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 

 

 

 

 

2.6

 

Dividends.

 

 

 

 

 

 No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record
of Holding Company Common Stock at, or as of, any time after the Effective
Date will be paid to the holder of any Holding Company Common Certificate or
Holding Company Book-Entry Share until such holder properly surrenders such
shares (or furnishes customary indemnity that the Holding Company Common
Certificate or Holding Company Book-Entry Share is lost, destroyed, stolen or
otherwise missing as provided in Section 2.2(d)) for exchange as provided
in Section 2.2 of this Agreement, promptly after which time all
such dividends or distributions will be paid (without interest).

 

 

 

 

 

2.7

 

Withholding Rights.

 

 

 

 

 

 The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined
herein) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

 In accordance with Section 55-13-02 of the NCBCA, no appraisal
rights shall be available to the holders of Holding Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or fact,

Subsidiary (i) is a duly organized bank, corporation, limited liability
company or statutory trust, validly existing and in good standing under
applicable laws, (ii) has full corporate or other applicable power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and (iii) is duly

stock or equity interests of each Holding Company Subsidiary have been duly
authorized and are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable and all such shares are directly or indirectly owned by Holding

or by general principles of equity).

Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary, nor the consummation by Holding Company

by Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary with any of the provisions hereof
will: (A) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the
Organizational Documents of Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary; (B)
constitute or result in the breach of any term, condition or provision of, or
constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration with respect to, or result in the creation of
any lien, charge or encumbrance upon, any property or asset of
Holding Company or any Holding Company Subsidiary pursuant to any (1)
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, or (2) any material license, agreement or
other instrument or obligation, to which Holding Company or any Holding
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which Holding Company or any Holding
Company Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets may be bound; or (C)

neither Holding Company nor Bank Subsidiary is aware of any reason why
the necessary Regulatory Approvals and consents will not be received

(e)  SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Accounting Controls.

 

 

 

(i)  Holding Company has filed all reports, registration statements, proxy
statements, offering circulars, schedules and other documents required to be
filed by it (collectively, the "Securities Documents") with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since June 15, 2016 under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, and, to the extent such Securities Documents
are not available on the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and
Retrieval system, made available to Towne copies of such Securities
Documents. Holding Company's Securities Documents, including the financial
statements, exhibits and schedules contained therein, (A) at the time filed,

the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and (B) at the time they were filed
(or if amended or superseded by one or more Securities Documents filed prior
to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), did not (and
any Securities Documents filed after the date of this Agreement will not)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in such Securities Documents
or necessary in order to make the statements made in such
Securities Documents, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 

 

 

(ii)  Each of Holding Company's financial statements contained in or
incorporated by reference into any Securities Documents (including any
Securities Documents filed after the date of this Agreement) (the "Financial
Statements") complied (or, in the case of Securities Documents filed after
the date of this Agreement, will comply) in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with
respect thereto, fairly presented (or, in the case of Securities Documents
filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present) the consolidated
financial position of Holding Company and the Holding Company Subsidiaries as
at the respective dates and the consolidated results of its operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, in each case in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods indicated,
except in each case as may be noted therein, and subject to normal year-end
audit adjustments and as permitted by Form 10-Q in the case of unaudited

(iii)  Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary have devised and maintain
a system of "internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in

reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
general or specific authorization of their respective Board of Directors
and duly authorized executive officers, (ii) transactions are recorded as

(iv)  Holding Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed by it in its Securities
Documents is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to its management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Holding Company
has disclosed, to its auditors and the audit committee of its Board of
Directors and on Section 3.3(e)(iv) of Holding Company's Disclosure
Schedule (i) based on the evaluation of such controls in conjunction
with its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the period ended
December 31, 2016, any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in

(x)  Holding Company has not established and does not maintain a
welfare plan, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, that provides benefits to
an employee at its expense after a termination of employment, except as

21

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (xi)   Except as set forth in Section 3.3(m)(xi) of Holding Company's
Disclosure Schedule, Holding Company and the Holding Company Subsidiaries

Code, covering the employees of Holding Company or any Holding Company
Subsidiary have been maintained in timely compliance with the notice and
healthcare continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code

 (xiv)  Section 3.3(m)(xiv) of Holding Company's Disclosure
Schedule accurately reflects the timing and the maximum amounts for
the payments that would be payable under the applicable Salary Continuation
Agreements for the respective individuals set forth therein in the event the
respective individuals were to have a Separation from Service immediately
following a Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the applicable
Salary Continuation Agreements) occurring on the assumed date and under
the circumstances specified in such Section of the Holding Company's
Disclosure Schedule. Upon a Separation from Service following a Change in
Control occurring on a date other than the date assumed in such Section of
the Holding Company's Disclosure Schedule, the timing and maximum amounts of
the payments under such Salary Continuation Agreements are determined in
a manner consistent with such Section of the Holding Company's Disclosure
Schedule. The four percent (4%) per annum effective interest rate and
discount rate used to compute such payments in Section 3.3(m)(xiv) of the
Holding Company's Disclosure Schedule is equal to the discount rate and
interest rate used by the Holding Company and Holding Company Subsidiaries
for the most recent five (5) years for accounting purposes and for purposes
of determining any payment obligations with regard to all
Salary Continuation Agreements (and similar agreements) of the
Holding Company and Holding Company Subsidiaries. The amount of the
monthly payments of the "Accrued Benefit" (as defined in the Salary
Continuation Agreements) under the respective Salary Continuation Agreements
is equal to the "Accrual Balance" (as defined in the Salary
Continuation Agreements) projected to a lump sum amount at Normal Retirement
at a rate of four percent (4%) per annum, and then converted to the monthly
payments commencing at Normal Retirement also based on a rate of four percent
(4%) per annum.

any of the Holding Company Subsidiaries has received any notice
of cancellation or a failure to renew with respect to any insurance policy
or bond or, within the last three (3) calendar years, and since January 1,
2017, has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for, and
Holding Company has no reason to believe that existing insurance coverage
cannot be renewed as and when the same shall expire upon terms and conditions
as favorable as those presently in effect, other than possible increases in

any extraordinary loss experience on the part of Holding Company or
the Holding Company Subsidiaries.

owned ("OREO") and any reserve for repossession with respect to mortgage
loans to be shown on its Securities Documents, Financial Statements or Bank

Governmental Authority restricting the operations of Towne or the operations
of any of the Towne Subsidiaries and neither Towne nor any of the Towne
Subsidiaries has been advised by any Governmental Authority or otherwise
become aware that any Governmental Authority is investigating, inquiring or
otherwise contemplating issuing or requesting the issuance of any such
agreement, order, memorandum, action or letter in the future. Since January
1, 2014, Towne and each of the Towne Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all laws, ordinances, requirements, regulations
or orders applicable to its business.

(k)  Tax Matters. Towne and each of the Towne Subsidiaries have filed all
Tax Returns required to be filed, and all such Tax Returns were correct and
complete in all material respects. All Taxes owed by Towne or any of the
Towne Subsidiaries have been paid, are reflected as a liability in
Towne's Securities Documents or Bank Reports, or are being contested in good
faith as set forth in Towne's Disclosure Schedule. No Tax Return filed by
Towne or any of the Towne Subsidiaries is the subject of any administrative
or judicial proceeding, no unpaid tax deficiency has been asserted against
Towne or any of the Towne Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority, and to
the Knowledge of Towne and any of the Towne Subsidiaries, no Tax Return filed
by Towne or any of the Towne Subsidiaries is under examination by
any Governmental Authority. There are no liens for Taxes (other
than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of
the assets of Towne or any of the Towne Subsidiaries. Towne is not and has
not been a "United States real property holding company" within the meaning
of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in
Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Towne is not aware of any reason why
the Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code. At all times since its formation and through the end of the day of
the Effective Date and of the Bank Merger Effective Date, Towne Merger Sub
has been and will be a "disregarded entity" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(b)(1) and 301.7701-3) with respect to Towne, and
neither Towne nor Towne Merger Sub has filed or will cause to be filed
any Tax-related election or Tax Return to the contrary that is effective or
applicable for any period before or including the later of the day of the
Effective Date and the day of the Bank Merger Effective Date.

 

 

 

 (l) Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 

 

(i)  All of the Towne Benefit Plans (as defined herein) are in compliance in
all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, and Towne has
administered such benefit plans in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations in all material respects. For the purposes of this Agreement, a
"Towne Benefit Plan" means an employee benefit plan and program of Towne and
the Towne Subsidiaries, including without limitation: (A) all retirement,
savings and other pension plans; (B) all health, severance, insurance,
disability and other employee welfare plans; and (C) all employment, vacation
and other similar plans, all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive,
deferred compensation, supplemental retirement, severance and other
employee and director benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and
all employment or compensation arrangements, in each case for the benefit of
or relating to its current and former employees and directors (collectively,
the "Towne Benefit Plans").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii)  Each Towne Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, as
reflected in a current favorable determination letter (based on IRS permitted
determination request procedures), or a filing for the same has been made
with the IRS seeking such a determination letter and that request is still
awaiting decision by the IRS (based on IRS permitted determination request
procedures). Nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination
that is reasonably likely to affect adversely such qualification
or exemption, or result in the imposition of excise Taxes or income Taxes on
unrelated business income under the Code or ERISA with respect to any Tax-
qualified plan. There have been no "terminations," "partial terminations"
or "discontinuances of contributions," as such terms are used in Section 411
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, to any Tax-qualified
plan during the preceding five years without notice to and approval by the
IRS and payment of all obligations and liabilities attributable to such Tax-
qualified plans.

 

 

 

(m)  Insurance. Towne and the Towne Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as management of Towne
reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry
practices. Since December 31, 2016, neither Towne nor any of the Towne
Subsidiaries has received any notice of cancellation or a failure to renew
with respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last three (3)
calendar years, and since January 1, 2017, has been refused any
insurance coverage sought or applied for, and Towne has no reason to
believe that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when
the same shall expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as
those presently in effect, other than possible increases in premiums
or unavailability of coverage that do not result from any extraordinary loss
experience on the part of Towne or the Towne Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

 (n) Allowance for Loan Losses.

 

 

 

(i)  All evidences of indebtedness reflected as assets by each of Towne or
any of the Towne Subsidiaries in its Securities Documents, Financial
Statements or Bank Reports as of December 31, 2016 were as of such date: (A)
evidenced by notes, agreements or evidences of indebtedness which are true,
genuine and what they purport to be; (B) to the extent secured, secured by
valid liens and security interests which have been perfected; and (C) the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor and any guarantor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles, and no defense, offset or counterclaim has
been asserted with respect to any such loan which if successful could have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

(ii)  The Loan Loss Allowance shown by Towne in its Securities Documents or
Bank Reports as of December 31, 2016 was, and the Loan Loss Allowance to be
shown in its Securities Documents or Bank Reports as of any date subsequent
to the date of this Agreement will be, as of such dates, adequate to provide
for possible losses, net of recoveries relating to loans previously charged
off, in respect of loans outstanding (including letter of credit or
commitments to make loans or extend credit). The Loan Loss Allowance has
been established in accordance with GAAP, and applicable
regulatory requirements and guidelines.

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

35

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(o)  Environmental Matters.  Towne and each of the Towne Subsidiaries are
in compliance with all Environmental Laws. Neither Towne nor any of the Towne
Subsidiaries has received any communication alleging that Towne or such Towne
Subsidiary is not in such compliance, and, to its Knowledge, there are no
present circumstances that would prevent or interfere with the
continuation of such compliance. To the Knowledge of Towne, there are no past
or present actions, activities, circumstances, events, or incidents that
could reasonably form the bases of any Environmental Claim or other claim or
action or governmental investigation that could result in the imposition of
any liability arising under any Environmental Laws against Towne or any of
the Towne Subsidiaries or against any person or entity whose liability for
any Environmental Claim Towne or an Towne Subsidiary has or may
have retained contractually or by operation of law. Notwithstanding
any other provision contained herein, the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 3.3(o) constitute the sole representations and
warranties of Towne regarding the existence of Environmental Claims,
compliance with or liability under Environmental Laws, or the presence of
Materials of Environmental Concern.

 

 

 

(p)  Books and Records. The books and records of Towne and those of the
Towne Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all
material respects, and there are no material inaccuracies or
discrepancies of any kind contained or reflected therein.

 

 

 

(q)  CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information Security.
Towne has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its most
recent examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. Towne does not
have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Towne: (i) to
be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with
the CRA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a
rating for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than
"Satisfactory"; or (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation in any
material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of
the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable
anti-money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not
to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable
privacy of customer information requirements contained in any federal and
state privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation, in Title V
of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information
security program adopted by Towne. To the Knowledge of Towne, no non-
public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by
an unauthorized third party in a manner which would cause either Towne or
any of the Towne Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The Board of
Directors of Towne (or where appropriate of any Towne Subsidiary) has
adopted, and Towne (or such Towne Subsidiary) has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the
USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements
in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and
the regulations thereunder, and Towne (or such Towne Subsidiary)
has complied in all material respects with any requirements to file reports
and other necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder.

 

 

 

(r)  Required Vote. No vote of the stockholders of Towne is required by the
VSCA, Towne's Articles of Incorporation, Towne's Bylaws or otherwise
to approve this Agreement and the Transaction. The affirmative vote
of Towne, as the sole member of Towne Merger Sub, is necessary to approve
this Agreement and the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(s)  Financial Advisors. None of Towne, any of the Towne Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors or employees has employed any
broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any fees
or commissions in connection with transactions contemplated herein, except
that, in connection with this Agreement, Towne has retained Sandler O'Neill and
Partners, L.P. as its financial advisor (pursuant to an engagement letter, a
true and complete copy of which is included in Section 3.4(s) of Towne's
Disclosure Schedule and under which such firm will be entitled to certain
fees in connection with this Agreement).

 

 

 

(t)  Fairness Opinion. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Board
of Directors of Towne has received the opinion (which, if initially rendered
verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the
same date) of Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P., to the effect that, as of
the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein,
the Exchange Ratio is fair to Towne, from a financial point of view. Such
opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 (u) Historic Business; No Redemption or Disposition. As of the date
of this Agreement it is the present intention, and as of the Effective Date
it will be the present intention, of Towne to continue, either through Towne
or through a member of Towne's "qualified group" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii) (the "Qualified Group"), at
least one significant historic business line of Holding Company and Bank
Subsidiary, or to use at least a significant portion of Holding
Company's and Bank Subsidiary's historic business assets in a business, in
each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d). As
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Date, neither Towne nor
any "related person" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(4)) to Towne has or will have any plan or intention to redeem or
reacquire, either directly or indirectly, any of the Towne Common Stock
issued to the stockholders of Holding Company in connection with the Merger.
As of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Date, Towne does not
have and will not have any plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of
any of the assets of Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary acquired in the
Transaction or pursuant to this Agreement, except for dispositions made in
the ordinary course of business or transfers described in Section
368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or described and permitted in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-2(k).

 

 

 

 (v) Representations and Warranties of Towne with Respect to Towne
Merger Sub.

 

 

 

 (i) Towne Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Towne, is a Virginia
limited liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Towne Merger Sub was formed by Towne
for the sole purpose of consummating the Merger, and has all requisite power
and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. As of the date

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties
hereto will use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, in good faith all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to
permit consummation of the Transaction as promptly as practicable and shall
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto to that end.

5.2  Access to Information; Confidentiality.

 

 

 

(a)  Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws regarding
the disclosure or exchange of information, Holding Company and
Bank Subsidiary shall permit Towne to make or cause to be made
such investigation of Holding Company's and Bank Subsidiary's operational,
financial and legal condition as Towne reasonably requests; provided, that
such investigation shall be reasonably related to the Transaction and shall
not interfere unreasonably with normal operations. No investigation, in and
of itself, by Towne shall affect the representations and warranties
of Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary. Holding Company shall provide to
Towne all written agendas and meeting or written consent materials provided
to the directors of Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary in connection with
board and committee meetings, subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information. Notwithstanding the above provisions in this Section
5.2(a), Towne and its representatives shall not be entitled to
receive information directly relating to the negotiation and prosecution
of this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided herein, relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal (as such terms are defined herein)
or any matters relating thereto. Neither Holding Company nor any of the
Holding Company Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of Holding Company or any of the Holding
Company Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

(b)  During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Date, Holding Company shall, upon the request of Towne, cause
one or more of its designated executive officers to confer on a monthly or
more frequent basis with Towne regarding Holding Company's financial
condition, operations and business and matters relating to the completion of
the Transaction. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than
the earlier of (i) the thirtieth (30th) day after the end of each calendar
quarter ending after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) the date of public
dissemination of earnings information pertaining to such calendar quarter (or
year with respect to a quarter ending on December 31), Holding Company will
deliver to Towne its unaudited balance sheet and statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows, without related notes, for such quarter
(or year with respect to a quarter ending on December 31) prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month,
Holding Company will deliver to Towne (i) such loan reports as Towne may
reasonably request, and (ii) such other financial data as Towne may
reasonably request. The financial statements required to be delivered by
this Section 5.2(b) may be consolidated.

 

 

 

(c)  Each party hereto will give prompt notice to the other party
(and subsequently keep the other party informed on a current basis) upon its
becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance known that (i) is reasonably likely to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it, or (ii) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

44

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d)  Each party hereto shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of its directors, officers, attorneys and advisors, to
maintain the confidentiality of, and not use to the detriment of the other
party, all information of the other party obtained prior to the date of
this Agreement or pursuant to this Section 5.2 that is not
otherwise publicly disclosed by the other party, unless such information
is required to be included in any filing required by law or in
an application for any Regulatory Approval required for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, such undertaking with respect to
confidentiality to survive any termination of this Agreement. In the case of
information that a party believes is necessary in making any such filing or
obtaining any such Regulatory Approval, that party will provide the
other party a reasonable opportunity to review any such filing or
any application for such Regulatory Approval before it is filed sufficient
for it to comment on and object to the content of such filing or application.
If this Agreement is terminated, each party shall promptly return to the
furnishing party or, at the request of the furnishing party, promptly destroy
in a manner that renders the information impracticable to read or
reconstruct and certify the destruction of all confidential information
received from the other party.

 

 

 

5.3  Holding Company Stockholder Approval.

 

 

 

(a)  Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms
and subject to Section 5.3(b), Holding Company shall call a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Holding Company Stockholder
Approval and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (such meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Holding Company
Stockholders Meeting"). In connection with that meeting, but subject
to Section 5.3(b) and a Change of Recommendation (as defined
herein) pursuant to Section 5.5(e), the Board of Directors of
Holding Company (i) shall support and recommend approval of this Agreement
and the Plan of Merger and any other matters required to be approved by
Holding Company's stockholders for consummation of the Merger (the "Holding
Company Recommendation"), and (ii) shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Holding Company Stockholder Approval.

 

 

 

(b)  Provided that the Holding Company is acting in good faith and in
compliance with its obligations under Section 5.3(a), Holding Company
may postpone or adjourn the Holding Company Stockholders Meeting: (i) with
the consent of Towne; (ii) for the absence of a quorum; (iii) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the stockholders of Holding Company within a
reasonable period of time in advance of the Holding Company Stockholders
Meeting; (iv) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional
proxies as necessary to obtain the Holding Company Stockholder Approval; or

5.4  Proxy Statement.

 

 

 

(a)  Each party will cooperate with the other party, and
their representatives, in the preparation of a proxy statement
and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials constituting a part
thereof (the "Proxy Statement"), to be filed with the SEC in connection with
(i) the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Holding Company for
the Holding Company Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) the offering and issuance
of Towne Common Stock in the Merger. Each party agrees to cooperate with
the other party, its legal, financial and accounting advisors, in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Each party shall prepare and furnish
to other parties such information relating to it and its directors, officers
and stockholders and such party's business and operations as may be
reasonably required to comply with SEC rules and regulations or SEC staff
comments in connection with the Proxy Statement, which information may be
based on such party's knowledge of and access to the information
required for said document and advice of counsel with respect to
SEC disclosure obligations. Each party shall provide the other parties and
its legal, financial and accounting advisors the opportunity to review and
provide comments: (i) upon such Proxy Statement a reasonable time prior to
its filing in preliminary and definitive forms and (ii) on all amendments and
supplements to the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for
additional information and replies to comments relating to the Proxy
Statement a reasonable time prior to filing or submission to the SEC.
Each party shall consider in good faith all comments from the other parties
and their respective legal, financial and accounting advisors to the Proxy
Statement, all amendments and supplements thereto and all responses to
requests for additional information, and shall not include any information in
the foregoing about a party or its officers, directors, business,
arrangements, operations or stock or the Transaction that has not been
approved by the other parties, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Each party agrees to
cooperate with the other parties and each other party's counsel
and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents,
analyses and letters from its financial advisor and independent auditor in
connection with the Proxy Statement. Each party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by
the SEC for use in definitive form as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the preliminary filing thereof and to cause a definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Holding Company stockholders as promptly
as reasonably practicable thereafter. Towne also agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities
law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 (b) Each party agrees, as to itself and its subsidiaries, that none of
the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to stockholders and the
time of the Holding Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
Each party further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information
furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement
to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

 

 

 

 (c) Holding Company agrees to advise Towne, promptly after Holding
Company receives notice thereof, of the time when the Proxy Statement
has been cleared by the SEC for use in definitive form or when
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the initiation or, to the
extent Holding Company is aware thereof, threat of any proceeding for any
such purpose, of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of
the Proxy Statement or for additional information or of any other
correspondence from the SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement that
relates to Towne or the Transaction. Holding Company agrees to promptly
provide to Towne copies of correspondence between Holding Company (or any of
its representatives and advisors on Holding Company's behalf), on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand as it relates to the Proxy Statement or
the Transaction.

 5.5 No Other Acquisition Proposals.

 

 

 

 (a) Holding Company agrees that it will not, and will cause the Holding
Company Subsidiaries and Holding Company's and the Holding
Company Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, agents
and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant
retained by Holding Company or any of the Holding Company Subsidiaries) not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) furnish any confidential or nonpublic
information relating to, or (iii) engage or participate in any negotiations
or discussions concerning, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
herein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holding Company, the Holding
Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (including any financial
advisor, attorney or accountant retained by Holding Company or any of
the Holding Company Subsidiaries) may contact any person or persons
to clarify the terms and conditions of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
and to inform such person of the terms of this Section 5.5.

 

 

 

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.5
shall prohibit Holding Company, prior to the receipt of the Holding Company
Approvals and subject to material compliance with the other terms of this
Section 5.5, from furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Holding
Company (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5) if, and only
to the extent that (i) the Holding Company Board of Directors concludes in
good faith, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be more
likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
to stockholders under applicable law, (ii) before taking such actions,
Holding Company receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement providing for reasonable protection of confidential
information, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person or
entity with any exclusive right to negotiate with Holding Company, and (iii)
the Holding Company Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in
a Superior Proposal (as defined below). Holding Company shall promptly
(within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Towne orally and in writing of Holding
Company's receipt of any such proposal or inquiry, the material terms and
conditions thereof, the identity of the person making such proposal or
inquiry, and will keep Towne apprised of any material related developments,
discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a
copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  For purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition Proposal" means, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, any of the
following transactions involving Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary: (i) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction; (ii)
any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the consolidated assets of Holding Company or fifteen percent (15%)
or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Holding Company or
the Holding Company Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than fifteen percent (15%) of the
consolidated assets of Holding Company; or (iii) any tender offer (including
a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
such third party beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of Holding Company or the Holding
Company Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than fifteen percent (15%) of the
consolidated assets of Holding Company.

 

 

 

 (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a person or
entity (or group of persons or entities acting in concert within the meaning
of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) that the Board of Directors of Holding
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
outside legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal (including the financing
thereof and any conditions thereto and taking into account the terms
and conditions of this Agreement) (i) is more favorable to the stockholders
of Holding Company from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed and in a timely manner; provided that, for
purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the Acquisition Proposal
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.5(c), except the
reference to "fifteen percent (15%) or more" in such definition shall
be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall
only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving Holding Company or
Bank Subsidiary.

 

 

 

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the receipt of the Holding Company Stockholder Approval, the Board
of Directors of Holding Company may (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or amend
the Holding Company Recommendation or (ii) authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend or otherwise declare advisable a Superior Proposal if the
Holding Company first takes the actions set forth in Section
7.1(i)(A) through (D) (any action in clause (i) or (ii), a "Change
of Recommendation"), in each case if the Board of Directors of Holding
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be more likely than not to result in a
violation of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law, and may also
take any action contemplated by Section 7.1.

 

 

 

(f)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including Sections 5.3
and 7.1), nothing in this Section 5.5 shall permit Holding Company to
terminate this Agreement or affect any other obligation of Holding Company
under this Agreement.

 

 

 

(g)  Holding Company agrees that any material violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.5 by any authorized representative of Holding
Company shall be deemed a breach of this Section 5.5 by Holding Company.

Regulatory Approvals and will make all necessary filings in respect of
the Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable.

 

 

 

(b)  Each party hereto will furnish to the other parties copies of proposed
applications in draft form and provide a reasonable opportunity for comment
prior to the filing of any such application with any Governmental Authority.
Each party hereto will promptly furnish to the other party copies of
applications filed with all Governmental Authorities and copies of written
communications received by such party from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party will
consult with the other party with respect to the obtaining of all Regulatory
Approvals and other material consents from third parties advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party
will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. All documents that the
parties or their respective subsidiaries are responsible for filing with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including to obtain Regulatory Approvals) will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of applicable law.

 

 

 

5.7  Public Announcements.

 

 

 

 Prior to the Effective Date, Towne and Holding Company will consult
with each other as to the form and substance of any press release or other

reasonably likely to become the subject of public disclosure).

(a)  Towne at its election shall either: (i) provide generally to officers
and employees of Holding Company and the Holding Company Subsidiaries, who at
or after the Effective Date become employees of Towne or the Towne
Subsidiaries ("Holding Company Continuing Employees"), employee benefits
under the Towne Benefit Plans (with no break in coverage), on terms and
conditions which are the same as for similarly situated officers and
employees of Towne and the Towne Subsidiaries; or (ii) maintain for
the benefit of the Holding Company Continuing Employees, the Holding Company
Benefit Plans maintained by Holding Company immediately prior to the
Effective Date; provided that Towne may take action to amend any Holding
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date to comply with
any law or, so long as the benefits provided under those Holding Company
Benefit Plans following such amendment are no less favorable to the Holding
Company Continuing Employees than benefits provided by Towne to its officers
and employees under any comparable Towne Benefit Plans, as necessary and
appropriate for other business reasons.

 

 

 

 (b) For purposes of participation, vesting and benefit accrual (except
not for purposes of benefit accrual with respect to any plan in which such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits) under the Towne Benefit
Plans, service with or credited by Holding Company or any of the Holding
Company Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with Towne. To the
extent permitted under applicable law, Towne shall cause welfare
Towne Benefit Plans maintained by Towne that cover the Holding
Company Continuing Employees after the Effective Date to (i) waive
any waiting period and restrictions and limitations for
preexisting conditions or insurability, and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Holding Company
Continuing Employees under welfare Holding Company Benefit Plans to be
credited to such Holding Company Continuing Employees under welfare Towne
Benefit Plans, so as to reduce the amount of any deductible, co-insurance or
maximum out-of-pocket payments payable by such Holding Company Continuing
Employees under welfare Towne Benefit Plans.

 

 

 

(c)  Each employee of Holding Company or any Holding Company Subsidiary at
the Effective Date whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than
for cause by Towne after the Effective Date, but on or before the date that
is six (6) months from the Effective Date, excluding any employee who has a
contract providing for severance pay, shall be entitled to receive severance
pay equal to two (2) weeks of pay, at his or her rate of pay in effect at the
time of termination, for each full year of continuous service with
Holding Company and Towne, subject to a minimum of four (4) weeks and
a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of pay. Such severance payments will be
in lieu of any payment under any severance pay plans that may be in effect at
Holding Company or any Holding Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective
Date.

 

 

 

(d)  With respect to Holding Company's 401(k) plan, Holding Company shall
cause such plan to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective
Date, in accordance with applicable law and subject to the receipt of all
applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each Holding
Company Continuing Employee who was a participant in the Holding
Company 401(k) plan and who continues in the employment of Towne or
any Towne Subsidiary shall be eligible to participate in Towne's 401(k) plan
on or as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Date, and
account balances under the terminated Holding Company 401(k) plan will be
eligible for distribution or rollover, including direct rollover, to Towne's
401(k) for Holding Company Continuing Employees. Any other former employee of
Holding Company or the Holding Company Subsidiaries who is employed by Towne
or the Towne Subsidiaries after the Effective Date shall be eligible to be a
participant in the Towne 401(k) plan upon complying with eligibility
requirements. All rights to participate in Towne's 401(k) plan are subject to
Towne's right to amend or terminate the plan. For purposes of
administering Towne's 401(k) plan, service with Holding Company and
the Holding Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with Towne
for participation and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit
accrual.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e)  Nothing in this Section 5.10 shall be interpreted as preventing Towne,
from and after the Effective Date, from amending, modifying or terminating
any Towne Benefit Plans or Holding Company Benefit Plans or any other
contracts, arrangements, commitments or plans of either party in accordance
with their terms and applicable law.

 

 

 

5.11  Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing.

 

 

 

(a)  Towne shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to authorize
and reserve for issuance such number of shares of Towne Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement, and to cause all such shares, when issued
pursuant to this Agreement, to be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.

 

 

 

(b)  Towne shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
Towne Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Date.

 

 

 

5.12  Indemnification; Insurance.

 

 

 

(a)  Following the Effective Date, Towne shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from Holding Company,
to the same extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to
indemnification pursuant to applicable law and Holding Company's
Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, in any case in which corporate approval may be
required to effectuate any indemnification, Towne shall direct, if the
party to be indemnified elects, that the determination of permissibility of
indemnification shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon
between Towne and the indemnified party.

 

 

 

(b)  Towne shall, at or prior to the Effective Date, purchase a six (6) year
"tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and conditions as the existing
directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by
Holding Company from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings,
covering, without limitation, the Merger and the Bank Merger;
provided, however, that the cost of such "tail" policy shall in no event
exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount of the last annual
premium paid by Holding Company for such existing directors' and officers'
liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, Towne would be required to expend more than
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount of the last annual premium
paid by Holding Company, Towne will obtain the maximum amount of
that insurance obtainable by payment of such amount.

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit
of and shall be enforceable by each indemnified party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

 

 

 

5.13  Employment and Other Arrangements.

 

 

 

(a)  Towne will, as of and after the Effective Date, assume and honor all
employment, severance, change in control, supplemental executive retirement
and deferred compensation agreements or arrangements that Holding Company and
the Holding Company Subsidiaries have with their current and former officers
and directors and which are set forth in Section 5.13(a) of
Holding Company's Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent any
such agreements or arrangements shall be superseded on or after
the Effective Date.

 

 

 

(b)  As of the date hereof, Towne has entered into employment arrangements
with the individuals named in Section 5.13(b) of Towne's Disclosure Schedule
as described in such schedule.

 

 

 

5.14  Notice of Deadlines.

 

 

 

 Holding Company has set forth in Section 5.14 of Holding
Company's Disclosure Schedule a complete and accurate list of the
deadlines for extensions or terminations of all material leases,
agreements or licenses (including specifically real property leases and
data processing agreements) to which Holding Company or any of the Holding
Company Subsidiaries is a party. For purposes of this Section 5.14, a
material agreement shall mean an agreement not terminable on sixty (60) days
or less notice and involving the payment or value of more than $50,000 per
year and/or has a termination fee.

 

 

 

5.15  Takeover Laws.

 

 

 

 If any federal or state anti-takeover laws or regulations may become,
or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
each party hereto and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary and legally
permissible so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such laws or
regulations on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

52

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  5.16 Change of Method.

 

 

 

 Towne and Holding Company shall be empowered, upon their mutual
agreement and at any time prior to the Effective Date (and whether before
or after the Holding Company Stockholders Meeting), to change the method or
structure of effecting the combination of Towne and Holding Company
(including the provisions of Article 1), if and to the extent they both deem
such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the Exchange Ratio or amount of cash to be
received by Holding Company stockholders in exchange for each share of
Holding Company Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment
of Towne or Holding Company pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) materially
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a timely manner. The parties hereto agree to reflect any such
change in an appropriate amendment to this Agreement executed by both parties
in accordance with Section 8.3.

 

  
 

 

5.17  Certain Policies.

 

 

 

 Prior to the Effective Date, each of Holding Company and Bank
Subsidiary shall, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws
and regulations, modify or change its respective Loan, OREO,
accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies
and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as
to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Towne; provided,
however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the

or both of Towne or Towne Merger Sub to enter into supplemental indentures
with the trustees of the Holding Company's trust preferred capital securities
to evidence the succession of either or both of Towne or Towne Merger Sub as
the obligor on those securities as of the Effective Date. The form of the
supplemental indentures shall be reasonably acceptable to Towne and
Holding Company. Towne agrees to assume, on its own or through Towne
Merger Sub, Holding Company's obligations under the indentures as well as
under the other agreements related to the trust preferred capital securities.

Towne in writing, at least three (3) business days in advance, that it
intends to accept a Superior Proposal; (B) upon Towne's request, Holding
Company shall discuss with Towne the facts and circumstances giving rise to
such decision and negotiate in good faith with Towne to facilitate Towne's

as would permit the Board of Directors of Holding Company not to accept the
Superior Proposal; (C) if Towne shall have delivered to Holding Company a
written offer capable of being accepted by Holding Company to alter the terms

then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number
(rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth (1/1000)) obtained by
dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the applicable
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Towne Ratio. If Towne
so elects within such five (5)-day period, it shall give prompt written
notice to Holding Company of such election and the revised applicable
Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this

taking of the vote of the stockholders of Holding Company contemplated by

  ARTICLE 2

 

  Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures

 

 

 

 2.1 Conversion of Shares.

 

 

 

 At the Effective Date, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Towne or Holding Company or their respective stockholders, or
Towne Merger Sub or its sole member:

 

 

 

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $1.667 per share, of
Towne ("Towne Common Stock"), and each equity interest of Towne Merger Sub,
that is issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall
remain issued and outstanding and shall remain unchanged by the Merger.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  Each share of common stock, par value $0.008 per share, of
Holding Company ("Holding Company Common Stock") that is issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Date shall be converted into and
exchanged for the right to receive 1.7250 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
Towne Common Stock, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.4 (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). All shares of Holding
Company Common Stock converted pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Date.

 

 

 

(c)  Each certificate previously representing shares of Holding
Company Common Stock (a "Holding Company Common Certificate") and the non-
certificated shares of Holding Company Common Stock (the "Holding Company
Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to represent any rights except the right to
receive with respect to each share of Holding Company Common Stock (i) the
Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Holding Company
Common Certificate or Holding Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with Section 2.2, and (ii) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6.

 

 

 

(d)  Each share of Holding Company Common Stock held by Towne or Town Merger
Sub and each share of Towne Common Stock held by Holding Company or any of
the Holding Company Subsidiaries (as defined in the Agreement) prior to the
Effective Date (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or
on behalf of third parties as a result of debts previously contracted) shall
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Date and
no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor; provided, that such
shares of Towne Common Stock shall resume the status of authorized and
unissued shares of Towne Common Stock.

 

 

 

 2.2 Exchange Procedures.

 

 

 

(a)  On or before the Closing Date, Towne shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with its transfer agent or such other transfer agent or
depository or trust institution of recognized standing approved by Towne (in
such capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the
Holding Company Common Certificates and the holders of Holding Company Book-
Entry Shares, at the election of Towne, either certificates representing the
shares of Towne Common Stock or noncertificated shares of Towne Common Stock
(or a combination) issuable pursuant to this Article 2, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto and any cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares without any interest thereon (the
"Exchange Fund"), in exchange for the Holding Company Common Certificates
and Holding Company Book-Entry Shares.

 

 

 

(b)  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Towne shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send to each former stockholder of record of Holding
Company immediately before the Effective Date transmittal materials for use
in exchanging such stockholder's Holding Company Common Certificates or
Holding Company Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration, as
provided for herein.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Towne shall cause the Merger Consideration into which shares of Holding
Company Common Stock are converted at the Effective Date, and dividends or
distributions that a Holding Company stockholder shall be entitled to
receive, to be issued and paid to such Holding Company stockholder upon
proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of Holding Company Common Certificates
and Holding Company Book-Entry Shares representing such shares of Holding
Company Common Stock, together with the transmittal materials duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto. No interest
will accrue or be paid on any such cash to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.4
or 2.6.

 

 

 

(d)  Any Holding Company stockholder whose Holding Company
Common Certificates or Holding Company Book-Entry Shares have been
lost, destroyed, stolen or are otherwise missing shall be entitled to
the Merger Consideration and dividends or distributions to which
such stockholder shall be entitled upon compliance with
reasonable conditions imposed by Towne pursuant to applicable law and
as required in accordance with Towne's standard policy (including the
requirement that the stockholder furnish customary indemnity).

 

 

 

(e)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of Holding Company for twelve (12) months after
the Effective Date shall be returned to Towne (together with any earnings in
respect thereof). Any stockholders of Holding Company who have not complied
with this Article 2 shall thereafter be entitled to look only to Towne, and
only as a general creditor thereof, for payment of the consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Holding Company Common Stock such
stockholder held as of the close of business on the Effective Date as
determined pursuant to this Plan of Merger, without any interest thereon.

 

 

 

(f)  None of the Exchange Agent, the parties hereto, the Towne Subsidiaries
(as defined in the Agreement) nor the Holding Company Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Agreement) shall be liable to any stockholder of Holding
Company for any amount of property delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-3

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.3  Holding Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

 

 

 

(a)  At the Effective Date, each option (to the extent any are outstanding),
whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of Holding Company Common
Stock (a "Holding Company Stock Option") granted under an equity or equity-
based compensation plan of Holding Company (a "Holding Company Stock Plan")
or otherwise granted shall be converted into an option (each, a "Replacement
Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Holding Company Stock Option (except as provided otherwise in this
Section 2.3(a)), the number of shares of Towne Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject
to the Holding Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Such product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise
price per share (rounded up to the next whole cent) of each Replacement
Option shall equal (y) the exercise price per share of shares of Holding
Company Common Stock that were purchasable pursuant to such Holding Company
Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Holding Company Stock Option that is intended to be
an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be adjusted if necessary
in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code, and all
other options shall be adjusted if necessary in a manner that maintains the
option's exemption from Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

 

(b)  At the Effective Date, each restricted stock award granted under
a Holding Company Stock Plan (a "Holding Company Stock Award") that is
unvested or contingent and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Date shall cease, at the Effective Date, to represent any rights with respect
to shares of Holding Company Common Stock and shall be converted without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, into a restricted stock award
of Towne (a "Replacement Stock Award"), on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Holding Company Stock Awards (but taking into
account any changes thereto, including any acceleration of vesting thereof,
provided for in the Holding Company Stock Plan or in the related award
document by reason of the Merger). The number of shares of Towne Common
Stock subject to each such Replacement Stock Award shall be equal to
the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to the Holding
Company Stock Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
to the nearest whole share of Towne Common Stock.

 

 

 

(c)  At the Effective Date, Towne shall assume the Holding Company
Stock Plans; provided that such assumption shall only be with respect to the
Replacement Options and Replacement Stock Awards, and Towne shall have no
obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the Holding Company
Stock Plans. The provisions of any such Holding Company Stock Plan will be
unchanged, except that (i) all references to Holding Company (other than any
references relating to a "change in control" (or similar term) of
Holding Company) in the Holding Company Stock Plan and in each
agreement evidencing any award thereunder shall be deemed to refer to
Towne, unless Towne reasonably determines otherwise, and (ii) the number of
shares of Towne Common Stock available for issuance pursuant to the Holding
Company Stock Plan following the Effective Date shall be equal to the number
of shares of Holding Company Common Stock so available immediately prior to
the Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary,
down to the nearest whole share of Towne Common Stock.

 

 

 

(d)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, Towne will deliver to
the holders of Replacement Options and Replacement Stock Awards any required
notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Holding
Company Stock Plan and award documents and stating that such Replacement
Options and Replacement Stock Awards have been issued by Towne and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.3 after giving effect to the Merger
and the terms of the Holding Company Stock Plan).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A-4

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 2.4 No Fractional Shares.

 

 

 

 Each holder of shares of Holding Company Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of Towne Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Towne Common Stock multiplied by the
average closing price per share of Towne Common Stock, as reported on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market, for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending
on and including the fifth trading day prior to the Effective Date.

 

  
 

 

2.5  Anti-Dilution.

 

 

 

 In the event Towne changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of shares of Towne Common Stock issued and outstanding before the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction,
appropriate and proportional adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 

 

 

2.6  Dividends.

 

 

 

 No dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record
of Holding Company Common Stock at, or as of, any time after the Effective
Date will be paid to the holder of any Holding Company Common Certificate or
Holding Company Book-Entry Share until such holder properly surrenders such
shares (or furnishes customary indemnity that the Holding Company Common
Certificate or Holding Company Book-Entry Share is lost, destroyed, stolen or
otherwise missing as provided in Section 2.2(d)) for exchange as provided
in Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger, promptly after which time all such
dividends or distributions will be paid (without interest).

 

 

 

2.7  Withholding Rights.

 

 

 

 The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any person
such amounts, if any, it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax (as defined in the Agreement) law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as
defined in the Agreement) by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will
be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to
such person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Exchange Agent.

 

 

 

2.8  No Appraisal Rights.

 

 

 

 In accordance with Section 55-13-02 of the NCBCA, no appraisal
rights shall be available to the holders of Holding Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Plan of Merger.

the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C-1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  Agreement to Vote.

 

 

 

 During the term of this Agreement and at such time as Holding
Company conducts the Holding Company Stockholders Meeting,
Shareholder agrees to vote or cause to be voted all of the Shares, and to
cause any holder of record of the Shares to vote all such Shares, in person
or by proxy: (i) in favor of the Merger Agreement at the Holding Company

action, proposal, transaction or agreement which could reasonably be expected
to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
other obligation or agreement of Holding Company or Bank Subsidiary under the
Merger Agreement or of Shareholder under this Agreement and (C) any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement that could reasonably be expected to
impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the

2.  Covenants of Shareholder.

 

 

 

 

 

 The Shareholder covenants and agrees as follows:

 

 

 

(a)  Ownership. The Shareholder is the beneficial and/or registered owner of
the Shares as set forth below Shareholder's name on the signature page
hereto. Except for Shareholder's Shares, Shareholder is not the beneficial
or registered owner of any other shares of Holding Company Common Stock or
rights to acquire shares of Holding Company Common Stock and for which
Shareholder has the right and power to vote and/or dispose. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.

 

 

 

(b)  Restrictions on Transfer. During the term of this Agreement,
Shareholder will not sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant a security interest in,
transfer or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Shares and will
not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than a
proxy for the purpose of voting Shareholder's Shares in accordance with
Section 1 hereof) which would during that term (i) restrict, (ii) establish a
right of first refusal to, or (iii) otherwise relate to, the transfer or
voting of the Shares.

 

 

 

(c)  Authority. The Shareholder has full power, authority and legal capacity
to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement, and to perform
fully Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder
in accordance with its terms.

 

 

 

(d)  No Breach. None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in a violation of, or a default under, or conflict with, any
contract, loan and credit arrangements, Liens (as defined in Section 2(e)
below), trust, commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or
restriction of any kind to which Shareholder is a party or bound or to which
the Shares are subject.

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C-2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e)  No Liens. The Shares and the certificates representing the Shares are
now, and at all times during the term of this Agreement, will be, held by
Shareholder, or by a nominee or custodian for the benefit of Shareholder,
free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests, claims,
proxies, voting trusts or agreements, understandings or arrangements or
any other encumbrances whatsoever (each, a "Lien"), except for (i) any Liens
arising hereunder and (ii) Liens, if any, which have been disclosed to Towne
in writing on the signature page hereto.

 

 

 

(f)  Consents and Approvals. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his or her
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation by him or her of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, require Shareholder to obtain
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority.

 

 

 

(g)  Absence of Litigation. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Shareholder, threatened against or
affecting Shareholder or any of Shareholder's affiliates before or by any
Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to materially
impair the ability of Shareholder to perform Shareholder's obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

(h)  No Solicitation. During the term of this Agreement, Shareholder shall
not, nor shall Shareholder permit any investment banker, attorney or other
adviser or representative of Shareholder to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

 

(i)  Statements. Shareholder shall not make any statement, written or oral,
to the effect that Shareholder does not support the Merger or that other
stockholders of Holding Company should not support the Merger.

 

  
 

 

3.  No Prior Proxies.

voting rights previously given in respect of the Shares are revocable,
and that any such proxies or voting rights are hereby irrevocably revoked.

following the termination of this Agreement, there shall be no further
liabilities or obligations hereunder on the part of Shareholder, Holding
Company or Towne, or their respective officers or directors, except that
nothing in this Section 6 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability
for breach of this Agreement before such termination.

 In furtherance of this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the date
hereof, Shareholder shall hereby authorize and instruct Holding Company to
instruct its transfer agent to enter a stop transfer order with respect to

Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 6 hereof.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

 

 

 [The undersigned is a director of Paragon Commercial Bank

("Towne"), has agreed to acquire Holding Company and Bank Subsidiary

dated as of April 26, 2017, by and among Towne, TB Acquisition, LLC, Holding
Company and Bank Subsidiary, and related plans of merger (collectively, the
"Agreement"). The undersigned has been offered the opportunity to become a
member of either or both of Towne's Board of Directors or one of Towne's
regional boards of directors following the Bank Merger Effective Date (as
defined in the Agreement) of the Bank Merger (as defined in the Agreement).

 

 

 

 As a condition of acceptance of such offer, and subject to the exceptions
below, the undersigned hereby agrees that, for the longer of (i) 12 months
following the Bank Merger Effective Date, or (ii) the period that the
undersigned shall be a member of any Towne board of directors identified in
the preceding paragraph, the undersigned will not, directly or indirectly:
(A) become a member of the board of directors or an advisory board of, or be
an organizer of, or be a 1% or more shareholder of, any entity engaged in or
formed for the purpose of engaging in a Competitive Business anywhere in the
Market Area (as such terms are defined below); or (B) in any individual or
representative capacity whatsoever, induce any individual to terminate his or
her employment with Towne or its Affiliates (as such term is defined below).

 

 

 

 As used in this Agreement, the term "Competitive Business" means the
financial services business, which includes one or more of the following
businesses: consumer and commercial banking, insurance brokerage, asset
management, residential and commercial mortgage lending, and any other
business in which Towne or any of its Affiliates are engaged; the term
"Market Area" means (i) the cities of Cary, Charlotte and Raleigh in
North Carolina, and any cities, towns and counties adjacent to
such localities, and (ii) any other city, town, county, or municipality in
North Carolina in which Towne has established and is continuing to operate a
banking office or a loan production office (excluding, for purposes of this
letter agreement, an office providing solely residential mortgage loans,
unless such office is in the areas identified in clause (i) above); the term
"Affiliate" means a Person that directly or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under
common control with, Towne; and the term "Person" means any person,
partnership, corporation, company, group or other entity.

 

 

 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the undersigned be
prevented from continuing to engage in, or being or continuing to engage in
any activities as an officer, employee, owner, shareholder, partner
or member in or of, or a member of the board of directors or a member of an
advisory board of, any entity engaged in, a Competitive Business if the
undersigned holds such position (or a corresponding position with the
predecessor to such entity) or otherwise engages in that Competitive Business
on the date hereof.

 

 

 

 This letter agreement is the complete agreement between Towne and
the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof and shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
North Carolina, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.

 

 

 

 This letter agreement is executed as of the 26th day of April 2017.

 

 

 

 

 

 Very truly yours
