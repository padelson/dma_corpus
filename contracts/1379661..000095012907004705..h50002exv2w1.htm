The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;  _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control,   ##### 

  

  

  

any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 9.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation. 

   

 (d) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought. 

   

 (e) In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a claim of indemnification under this Article IX, no other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3, the indemnification procedures set forth in Article VII shall control any indemnities relating to Taxes. 

   

 Section 9.4 _Additional Agreements Regarding Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: 

  

 (a) a breach of any representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) of Seller in this Agreement in connection with any single item or group of related items that results in Losses of less than $250,000 shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Article IX not to be a breach of such representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant; 

   

 (b) Seller shall have no liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations or warranties (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) except if the aggregate Losses actually incurred by Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder exceed $10,000,000 (and then, subject to Section 9.4(c), only to the extent such aggregate Losses exceed such amount); 

   

 (c) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations, warranties or pre-closing covenants (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) exceed $80,000,000; 

   

 (d) The amount of any Loss for which a Buyer Indemnified Party claims indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by: (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered with respect to such Loss; (ii) any Tax Benefits with respect to such Loss and (iii) indemnification or reimbursement payments actually recovered from third parties with respect to such Loss; 

   

 (e) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty by a party in connection with the assertion of a claim for indemnification under Article IX, or determining the amount of a Loss, with respect to any asserted breach or inaccuracy, such determination shall be made without regard to any qualifier as to "material," "materiality" or Material Adverse Effect expressly contained in Article III or IV.
