of Delaware and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Sub ("Merger Sub"), and
Global Marine Inc., a company organized under the laws of

providing for, among other things, the voting of the Santa Fe Ordinary Shares
owned by SFIC Holdings (Cayman), Inc.   C. Intended U.S. Accounting

the purchase of Santa Fe by Global for U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER

Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into

"Surviving Entity"). The Merger shall have the effects specified herein and
in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL").  
Section 1.2 The Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at

Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business day immediately

place as Santa Fe and Global may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs
is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."   Section 1.3 Effective
Time. On the Closing Date, Santa Fe, Global and Merger Sub shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") meeting the requirements

Conversion of Capital Stock of Global and Merger Sub.   (a) At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into and become one fully paid and
non- assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Entity.   (b) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $.10 per share, of Global ("Global Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Global Common Stock to be canceled without payment of any consideration
therefor pursuant to Section 4.2(c)), shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive a number of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares equal to the Merger
Ratio, which Santa Fe Ordinary Shares shall be transferred by Sub pursuant to
the Merger, and each such share of Global Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of such shares of Global Common Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Global Common Stock, except
the right to receive, without interest, certificates for Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares in accordance with Section 4.3(b) and cash for fractional shares in
accordance with Sections 4.3(b) and 4.3(d) upon the surrender of the relevant
Certificate (as hereinafter defined).   (c) Each share of Global Common
Stock issued and held in Global\'s treasury and each share of Global Common
Stock owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Global or   4   by Santa
Fe, Sub or Merger Sub, shall, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the
Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor, and no capital shares of Santa
Fe or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (d)
(i) At the Effective Time, all options to acquire shares of Global Common
Stock outstanding at the Effective Time under Global\'s stock plans
(collectively, the "Global Stock Plans") identified in Section 4.2(d) of the
Global Disclosure Letter and all options to acquire shares of Global Common
Stock issued hereafter pursuant to Section 7.1(f) (individually, a "Global
Option" and collectively, the "Global Options") shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time, subject to the modifications
described in this Section 4.2(d). Prior to the Effective Time, Global and
Santa Fe shall take all actions (if any) as may be required to permit the
assumption of such Global Options by Santa Fe pursuant to this Section
4.2(d)(i). At the Effective Time, the Global Options shall be assumed and
adjusted by Santa Fe in such manner that Santa Fe (i) is a corporation
"assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applies"
within the meaning of Section 424 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or (ii) to the extent that the Global Option is not
or ceases to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Code, would be such a corporation were Section 424 of the
Code applicable to such option. Each Global Option assumed and adjusted by
Santa Fe shall, in accordance with the Global Stock Plans and the option
agreements entered into pursuant thereto, be fully vested and exercisable as
of the Effective Time and shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions as under the applicable Global Stock Option Plan and the
applicable option agreement entered into pursuant thereto, except that (i)
immediately following the Effective Time (A) each Global Option shall be
exercisable for that whole number of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares equal to the
product (rounded to the nearest whole share) of the number of shares of
Global Common Stock subject to such Global Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Ratio, and (B) the exercise price per
Santa Fe Ordinary Share shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per
share of Global Common Stock subject to such Global Option in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Merger Ratio (the
price per share, as so determined, being rounded down to the nearest whole
cent), and (ii) as of the Effective Time, each Global Option outstanding
under Global\'s 1990 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan identified in
Section 4.2(d) of the Global Disclosure Letter shall be deemed modified to
remain exercisable for the full scheduled term of such Global Option in the
event the holder of such Global Option does not become a non-
employee director of Santa Fe, or terminates service as a non-employee
director of Santa Fe prior to the expiration of the option under conditions
which would permit the option to remain outstanding and exercisable for its
full scheduled term under the terms of the Global Options issued to such non-
employee director pursuant to the Global 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock
Option and Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan"), and to remain exercisable for
three months following termination of service under any other conditions.
Without limiting the foregoing, effective at the Effective Time, Santa Fe
shall assume the Global 1998 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the Global 1994
Non-Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and the 2001 Plan (collectively
the "Assumed Plans") for purposes of employing such plans to make grants of
stock options and other awards based on Santa Fe Ordinary Shares following
the Effective Time.   5    (ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, Santa
Fe  shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for  issuance a
number of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares equal to the  number of Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares available for issuance  pursuant to the Assumed Plans (which number
shall be the  product (rounded to the nearest whole share) of the number of 
shares of Global Common Stock available for issuance  immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the  Merger Ratio). On the Closing Date,
Santa Fe shall file with  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") a  Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or a post-effective  amendment
on Form S-8 with respect to the Form S-4 (as defined  in Section 7.8) or such
other appropriate form) covering all  such Santa Fe Ordinary Shares and shall
cause such  registration statement to remain effective (and shall cause  the
prospectus or prospectuses relating thereto to remain  compliant with
applicable securities laws) for as long as  there are outstanding any such
Global Options.   (iii) Except as otherwise specifically provided by  this
Section 4.2(d), the terms of the Global Options and the  relevant Global
Stock Plans, as in effect on the Effective  Time, shall remain in full force
and effect with respect to  the Global Options after giving effect to the
Merger and the  assumptions by Santa Fe as set forth above. As soon as 
practicable following the Effective Time, Santa Fe shall  deliver to the
holders of Global Options appropriate notices  setting forth such holders\'
rights pursuant to the respective  Global Stock Plans and the agreements
evidencing the grants of  such Global Options, and that such Global Options
and such  agreements shall be assumed by Santa Fe and shall continue in 
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the  adjustments required
by this Section 4.2(d)).   (e) Santa Fe shall agree to be bound by the
conversion provisions of Global\'s Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due
2020 (the "Global Convertible Debentures"), such that following the Effective
Time, each outstanding Global Convertible Debenture will be convertible into
the number of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares) that the holder thereof would have had the right to receive after the
Effective Time if such Global Convertible Debenture had been converted
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   Section 4.3 Exchange of
Certificates Representing Global  Common Stock.   (a) As of the Effective
Time, Sub shall appoint Mellon Investor Services LLC or such other party
reasonably satisfactory to Global as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"),
and Sub shall, when and as needed, deposit, or cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Global Common
Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 4, certificates
representing the Santa Fe Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to Section
4.2 and delivered pursuant to this Section 4.3 in exchange for outstanding
shares of Global Common Stock. When and as needed, the Surviving Entity shall
provide the Exchange Agent immediately following the Effective Time cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Sections 4.3(b) and 4.3(d) (such cash and certificates for Santa Fe
Ordinary Shares together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").   6   
(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Sub shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates ("Certificates")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Global
Common Stock (other than to holders of shares of Global Common Stock that,
pursuant to Section 4.2(c), are canceled without payment of any consideration
therefor): (A) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Santa Fe may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Santa
Fe Ordinary Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of
whole Santa Fe Ordinary Shares and (y) a check representing the amount of
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 4, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Global
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Global, a
certificate representing the proper number of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares
together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares,
may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Global Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (c) Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares represented by such Certificate as a result of the conversion provided
in Section 4.2(b) or 4.2(c) until such Certificate is surrendered as provided
herein. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Certificates so
surrendered, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore payable and not paid with respect to the number of whole
Santa Fe Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to Section 4.2, less the amount of
any withholding taxes, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender
payable with respect to such whole Santa Fe Ordinary Shares, less the amount
of any withholding taxes.   (d) At or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall pay from funds on hand at the Effective Time any
dividends or make other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by Global on shares of
Global Common Stock which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Entity of the shares of Global Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, the presented
Certificates shall   7   be canceled and exchanged for certificates
representing Santa Fe Ordinary Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 4. Certificates
surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of Global
for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until Global has received a written
agreement from such person as provided in Section 7.11.   (e) No fractional
Santa Fe Ordinary Shares shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the
issuance of any fractional Santa Fe Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section
4.2(b), cash adjustments provided by Sub will be paid to holders in respect
of any fractional Santa Fe Ordinary Shares that would otherwise be issuable,
and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to such fractional
proportion of the Santa Fe Ordinary Share Price. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Santa Fe Ordinary Share Price" shall mean the average of the
per share closing prices of the Santa Fe Ordinary Shares as reported on
the consolidated transaction reporting system for securities traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") (as reported in the New York City
edition of The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another
authoritative source) for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth
trading day prior to the Closing Date, appropriately adjusted for any stock
splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or other
similar transactions.   (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof and any certificates for Santa Fe
Ordinary Shares) that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of
Global one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Sub. Any
former stockholders of Global who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Sub for delivery of certificates
representing their Santa Fe Ordinary Shares and cash in lieu of fractional
shares and to Santa Fe for any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Santa Fe Ordinary Shares deliverable to such former stockholder pursuant to
this Agreement.   (g) None of Santa Fe, Sub, Global, the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any person
for any portion of the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (h)
In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Entity, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Entity may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
certificates representing the Santa Fe Ordinary Shares, cash in lieu of
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares, as provided in Section 4.3(c), deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.   Section 4.4 Adjustment of Merger Ratio. In the
event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, Santa Fe changes the number of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares, or
Global changes the number of shares of Global Common Stock, issued and
outstanding as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or   8   other similar transaction, the Merger
Ratio and other items dependent thereon shall be appropriately adjusted.  
Section 4.5 Rule 16b-3 Approval. Santa Fe agrees that the Santa Fe Board of
Directors or the Executive Compensation Committee of the Santa Fe Board of
Directors shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, adopt
resolutions specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 ("Rule 16b-3")
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
the receipt, pursuant to Section 4.2, of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares, and of
options to acquire Santa Fe Ordinary Shares, by executive officers or
directors of Global who become executive officers or directors of Santa Fe
subject to Rule 16b-3.   ARTICLE 5   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
GLOBAL   Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Santa Fe
by Global at or prior to the execution hereof (the "Global Disclosure
Letter") and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement
to which exception is being taken, Global represents and warrants to Santa
Fe, Sub and Merger Sub that:   Section 5.1 Existence; Good Standing;
Corporate Authority. Global is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Global
is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or similar
concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the
laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or
leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified does not
and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Global Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 10.9). Global has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease
its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of
Global\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available
to Santa Fe are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date
hereof.   Section 5.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements.
Global has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to
which it is a party. The consummation by Global of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on behalf of Global, other than the approvals referred to in Section
5.20. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
Global, enforceable against Global in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general principles of equity.
Global has taken all action necessary to render the restrictions set forth in
Section 203 of the DGCL, and any other applicable takeover law restricting or
purporting to restrict business combinations, and in Article Ninth of its
certificate of incorporation inapplicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 5.3 Capitalization. The
authorized capital stock of Global consists of 300,000,000 shares of Global
Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par   9   value
$.01 per share. As of August 29, 2001, there were 176,602,294
outstanding shares of Global Common Stock, 19,124,251 shares of Global Common
Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of Global Options, 241,891 shares
reserved for issuance under the Global Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock
Plan, 7,330,920 shares of Global Common Stock reserved for issuance upon
conversion of outstanding Global Convertible Debentures, 5,043 shares of
Global Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of Global senior
debt (none of which shares will ever be issuable because none of such senior
debt remains enforceable) and no outstanding shares of Global preferred
stock. All such issued and outstanding shares of Global Common Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in this Section
5.3, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock and there are no
options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or other
rights, agreements or commitments which obligate Global or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of Global or any of its Subsidiaries. Global has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Global on
any matter.   Section 5.4 Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Significant Subsidiary" shall mean significant subsidiary as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act. Each of Global\'s Significant
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and, to the extent such concept or similar concept exists in the
relevant jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the corporate or other entity power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure
to be so qualified or to be in good standing does not and is not reasonably
likely to have a Global Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
ownership interests in, each of Global\'s Subsidiaries are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Global free and clear of all mortgages, deeds of trust, liens,
security interests, pledges, leases, conditional sale contracts, charges,
privileges, easements, rights of way, reservations, options, rights of first
refusal and other encumbrances ("Liens").   Section 5.5 Compliance with
Laws; Permits. Except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate,
do not or are not reasonably likely to have a Global Material Adverse Effect
and except for matters arising under Environmental Laws (as defined herein)
which are treated exclusively in Section 5.13:   (a) Neither Global nor any
Subsidiary of Global is in violation of any  applicable law, rule,
regulation, code, governmental determination, order,  treaty, convention,
governmental certification requirement or other public  limitation, U.S. or
non-U.S. (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), and no  claim is pending or, to
the knowledge of Global, threatened with respect to  any such matters. No
condition exists which does or is reasonably likely to  constitute a
violation of or deficiency under any Applicable Law by Global  or any
Subsidiary of Global.   10    (b) Global and each Subsidiary of Global
hold all permits, licenses,  certifications, variations, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of  all governmental or regulatory authorities
necessary for the conduct of  their respective businesses (the "Global
Permits"). All Global Permits are  in full force and effect and there exists
no default thereunder or breach  thereof, and Global has no notice or actual
knowledge that such Global  Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary
course after the Effective  Time. No governmental authority has given, or to
the knowledge of Global  threatened to give, any action to terminate, cancel
or reform any Global  Permit.   (c) Each drilling rig, drillship or other
drilling unit owned or  leased by Global or a subsidiary of Global which is
subject to  classification is in class according to the rules and regulations
of the  applicable classifying body and is duly and lawfully documented under
the  laws of its flag jurisdiction.   (d) Global and each Subsidiary of
Global possess all permits,  licenses, operating authorities, orders,
exemptions, franchises, variances,  consents, approvals or other
authorizations required for the present  ownership and operation of all its
real property or leaseholds ("Global  Real Property"). There exists no
material default or breach with respect  to, and no party or governmental
authority has taken or, to the knowledge  of Global, threatened to take, any
action to terminate, cancel or reform  any such permit, license, operating
authority, order, exemption, franchise,  variance, consent, approval or other
authorization pertaining to Global  Real Property.   Section 5.6 No
Conflict. (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Global of this Agreement
nor the consummation by Global of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof will (i) subject to the approvals referred
to in Section 5.20, conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Global, (ii) violate, or
conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right
of termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under,
or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties of Global or its Subsidiaries under, or
result in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect,
or otherwise result in a detriment to Global or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease,
contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which
Global or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Global or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected or (iii)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 5.6(b),
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable
to Global or any of its Subsidiaries, except, for such matters described in
clause (ii) or (iii) as do not and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
Neither the execution and delivery by Global of this Agreement nor the
consummation by Global of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or
regulatory authority, other than (i) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger   11   provided for in Section 1.3, (ii) filings required under
the U.S. Hart-Scott- Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(the "HSR Act"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or applicable state
securities and "Blue Sky" laws, and (iii) filings and notifications required
under applicable Non-U.S. antitrust laws set forth in Schedule 5.6 of the
Global Disclosure Letter ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the "Regulatory
Filings"), except for any consent, approval or authorization the failure of
which to obtain and for any filing or registration the failure of which to
make does not and is not reasonably likely to have a Global Material Adverse
Effect.   (c) This Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby do not, and will not upon consummation of such
transactions in accordance with their terms, constitute a "Change of Control"
for the purposes of, or a default under, (A) the Indenture dated as of
September 1, 1997, between Global and Wilmington Trust Company, as Trustee
(the "Indenture Trustee"), or the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of
June 23, 2000 between Global and the Indenture Trustee (the "Supplemental
Indenture") or (B) the Global Convertible Debentures.   Section 5.7 SEC
Documents. Global has filed with the SEC all documents (including exhibits
and any amendments thereto) required to be so filed by it since January 1,
1999 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and has
made available to Santa Fe each registration statement, report, proxy
statement or information statement (other than preliminary materials) it has
so filed, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto)
filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Global Reports"). As of its respective
date, each Global Report (i) complied in all material respects in accordance
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in
or incorporated by reference into the Global Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Global and its Subsidiaries as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
changes in stockholders\' equity included in or incorporated by reference
into the Global Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or
changes in stockholders\' equity, as the case may be, of Global and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q
of the SEC and (y) normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. Except as and to
the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of Global and its
Subsidiaries included in the most recent Global Report filed prior to the
date of this Agreement that includes such a balance sheet, including all
notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet, neither Global nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be
reflected on, or reserved against in, a balance sheet of Global or in the
notes thereto prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied, other than liabilities or obligations which
do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect.   12    Section 5.8
Litigation. Except as described in the Global Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against
Global or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Global\'s knowledge, threatened
against Global or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or in any
arbitration or similar proceedings, before or by any U.S. federal, state or
non-U.S. court, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality or any
U.S. or non-U.S. arbitral or other dispute resolution body, that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Global
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.9 Absence of Certain Changes. From
December 31, 2000 to the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) any
event or occurrence that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Global
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any material change by Global or any of its
Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in any of its accounting methods,
principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or elections,
(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
distribution in respect of any capital stock of Global or any redemption,
purchase or other acquisition of any of its securities or (iv) any increase
in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance,
deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option,
stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice.   Section 5.10 Taxes. (a) All
tax returns, statements, reports, declarations, estimates and forms
("Returns") required to be filed by or with respect to Global and any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Return required to be filed by a consolidated,
combined or unitary group that included Global or any of its Subsidiaries) on
or prior to the date hereof have been duly filed on a timely basis with the
appropriate governmental authorities, except to the extent that any failure
to file does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect, and all taxes due with such
Returns have been duly paid, or deposited in full on a timely basis or
adequately reserved for in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, except to the extent that any failure to pay or deposit or make
adequate provision for the payment of such taxes does not and is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Global
Material Adverse Effect. Representations made in this Section 5.10 are made
to the knowledge of Global to the extent that the representations relate to
a corporation which was, but is not currently, a part of Global\'s or
any Subsidiary\'s affiliated, consolidated, combined unitary or similar
group.   (b) Except to the extent not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect, (i) no
audits or other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are presently
pending with regard to any taxes or Returns of Global or any of its
Subsidiaries as to which any taxing authority has asserted in writing any
claim; (ii) no governmental authority is now asserting in writing any
deficiency or claim for taxes or any adjustment to taxes with respect to
which Global or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable with respect to income
and other material taxes which have not been fully paid or finally settled;
and (iii) neither Global nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for
taxes under Treas. Reg. (S) 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. tax law, except for taxes of the affiliated group of which
Global is the common parent, within the meaning of Section 1504(a)(1) of the
Code or any similar provision of state, local, or non- U.S. tax law. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Global nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted any requests, agreements, consents or waivers to extend the statutory
period of limitations applicable to the assessment of   13   any taxes
with respect to any Returns of Global or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
Global nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any closing
agreement described in Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision
thereof or any similar agreement under state, local, or non-U.S. tax law.
Neither Global nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound by or has
any obligation under any tax sharing, allocation or indemnity agreement or
any similar agreement or arrangement. Neither Global nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code. To the
knowledge of Global, Global has not been a United States real property
holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code at
any time within the past five years.   (c) For purposes of this Agreement,
"tax" or "taxes" means all net income, gross income, gross receipts, sales,
use, ad valorem, transfer, accumulated earnings, personal holding company,
excess profits, franchise, profits, license, withholding, payroll,
employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, property,
disability, capital stock, or windfall profits taxes, customs duties or other
taxes, fees, assessments or governmental charges of any kind whatsoever,
together with any interest and any penalties, additions to tax or additional
amounts imposed by any taxing authority (U.S. or non-U.S.).   Section 5.11
Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 5.11 of the Global Disclosure Letter
contains a list of all Global Benefit Plans. The term "Global Benefit Plans"
means all material employee benefit plans and other material benefit
arrangements, including all "employee benefit plans" as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), whether or not U.S.-based plans, and all other material
employee benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, stock option (or
other equity- based), severance, employment, change in control, welfare
(including post- retirement medical and life insurance) and fringe benefit
plans, practices or agreements, whether or not subject to ERISA or U.S.-based
and whether written or oral, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or
required to be contributed to by Global or any of its Subsidiaries, to which
Global or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is required to provide
benefits under applicable law or in which any person who is currently, has
been or, prior to the Effective Time, is expected to become an employee of
Global is a participant. Global will provide Santa Fe, within 30 days after
the date hereof, with true and complete copies of the Global Benefit Plans
and, if applicable, the most recent trust agreements, Forms 5500, summary
plan descriptions, funding statements, annual reports and actuarial reports,
if applicable, for each such plan.   (b) Except as for such matters as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not and are not reasonably likely to
have a Global Material Adverse Effect: all applicable reporting and
disclosure requirements have been met with respect to Global Benefit Plans;
there has been no "reportable event," as that term is defined in Section 4043
of ERISA, with respect to Global Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA
for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived; to the extent
applicable, the Global Benefit Plans comply with the requirements of ERISA
and the Code or with the regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, and any
Global Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS; the Global
Benefit Plans have been maintained and operated in accordance with their
terms, and, to Global\'s knowledge, there are no breaches of fiduciary
duty in connection with the Global Benefit Plans; there are no pending or,
to Global\'s knowledge, threatened claims against or otherwise involving any
Global Benefit Plan, and no   14   suit, action or other litigation
(excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Global
Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to any such
Global Benefit Plan; all material contributions required to be made as of the
date hereof to the Global Benefit Plans have been made or provided for; with
respect to the Global Benefit Plans or any "employee pension benefit plans,"

single employer, with Global or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), (i) neither Global nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any direct or indirect liability
under Title IV of ERISA in connection with any termination thereof or
withdrawal therefrom; and (ii) there does not exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived.   (c) Neither Global nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA Affiliates contributes to, or has an
obligation to contribute to, and has not within six years prior to the
Effective Time contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute to, a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and the
execution of, and performance of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) constitute an event under any benefit plan, policy,
arrangement or agreement or any trust or loan (in connection therewith) that
will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise),
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligations to fund benefits with respect to any employee of
Global or any Subsidiary thereof.   (d) No Global Benefit Plan provides

any employees in the U.S. or (y) involving, in any single instance, 10% or
more of the employees of Global and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  
(b) Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have a
Global Material Adverse Effect and except as described in the Global Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) neither Global nor
any Subsidiary of Global has received any written complaint of any unfair
labor practice or other unlawful employment practice or any written notice of
any material violation of any federal, state or local statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules,   15   regulations, orders or directives with respect
to the employment of individuals by, or the employment practices of, Global
or any Subsidiary of Global or the work conditions or the terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours of their respective businesses
and (ii) there are no unfair labor practice charges or other employee related

and is in compliance with all applicable orders of any court, governmental
authority or arbitration board or tribunal and any applicable law, ordinance,
rule, regulation or other legal requirement (including common law) related to
human health and the environment ("Environmental Laws") except for such
matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect. There are no past or
present facts, conditions or circumstances that interfere with the conduct of
any of their respective businesses in the manner now conducted or which
interfere with continued compliance with any Environmental Law, except for
any non-compliance or interference that is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect,
no judicial or administrative proceedings or governmental investigations
are pending or, to the knowledge of Global, threatened against Global or
its Subsidiaries that allege the violation of or seek to impose liability
pursuant to any Environmental Law, and there are no past or present facts,
conditions or circumstances at, on or arising out of, or otherwise associated
with, any current (or, to the knowledge of Global or its Subsidiaries,
former) businesses, assets or properties of the Global or any Subsidiary of
Global, including but not limited to on-site or off-site disposal, release or
spill of any material, substance or waste classified, characterized or
otherwise regulated as hazardous, toxic, pollutant, contaminant or words of
similar meaning under Environmental Laws, including petroleum or petroleum
products or byproducts ("Hazardous Materials") which violate Environmental

or obligations for any cleanup, remediation, disposal or corrective action
under any Environmental Law, (ii) claims arising for personal injury,
property damage or damage to natural resources, or (iii) fines, penalties or

Section 5.14 Intellectual Property. Global and its Subsidiaries own
or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all patents,
patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary information used
or held for use in connection with their respective businesses as currently
being conducted, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses and
other rights does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect, and there are no
assertions or claims challenging the validity of   16   any of the
foregoing that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect. The conduct of Global\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' respective businesses as currently conducted does not
conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark
rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Global
Material Adverse Effect. There is no material infringement of any proprietary
right owned by or licensed by or to Global or any of its Subsidiaries that is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Global
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.15 Decrees, Etc. Except for such
matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have a Global Material
Adverse Effect, (a) no order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment, award
or determination of any court or governmental authority or any arbitral or
other dispute resolution body has been issued or entered against Global or
any Subsidiary of Global that continues to be in effect that affects the
ownership or operation of any of their respective assets or that involves an
amount greater than $5 million, and (b) since January 1, 1991, no criminal
order, writ, fine, injunction, decree, judgment or determination of any court
or governmental authority has been issued against Global or any Subsidiary of
Global.   Section 5.16 Insurance. (a) Except for such matters as do not
and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Global Material Adverse Effect, Global and its Subsidiaries maintain
insurance coverage with financially responsible insurance companies in such
amounts and against such losses as are customary in the drilling services and
oil and gas industries on the date hereof.   (b) Except for such matters as
do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect, no event relating specifically
to Global or its Subsidiaries (as opposed to events affecting the drilling
services or oil and gas industries in general) has occurred that is
reasonably likely, after the date of this Agreement, to result in an upward
adjustment in premiums under any insurance policies they maintain. Excluding
insurance policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course
of business, no excess liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance
policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to the date
hereof, and to Global\'s knowledge, no threat in writing has been made
to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any
such insurance policy of Global or any Subsidiary of Global during the period
of one year prior to the date hereof. Prior to the date hereof, no event has
occurred, including the failure by Global or any Subsidiary of Global to give
any notice or information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or
information, which materially limits or impairs the rights of Global or any
Subsidiary of Global under any such excess liability, hull or protection and
indemnity insurance policies.   Section 5.17 No Brokers. Global has not
entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or
firm which may result in the obligation of Global or Santa Fe to pay any
finder\'s fees, brokerage or other like payments in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that Global has retained Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated as its financial advisor, the arrangements with
which have been disclosed in writing to Santa Fe prior to the date
hereof.   17    Section 5.18 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Board of
Directors of Global has received the opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co.
Incorporated to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Merger
Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Global
Common Stock.   Section 5.19 Santa Fe Share Ownership. Neither Global nor
any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares in the capital of Santa Fe or any
other securities convertible into or otherwise exercisable to acquire shares
in the capital of Santa Fe.   Section 5.20 Vote Required. The only votes of
the holders of any class or series of Global capital stock necessary to
approve any transaction contemplated by this Agreement are the affirmative
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Global Common Stock.   Section 5.21
Ownership of Drilling Rigs and Drillships. (a) As of the date hereof, Global
or a Subsidiary of Global has good and marketable title to the drilling rigs
and drillships listed in Global\'s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, in
each case free and clear of all Liens except for (a) defects
or irregularities of title or encumbrances of a nature that do not
materially impair the ownership or operation of these assets and which have
not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Global Material Adverse
Effect, (b) Liens that secure obligations not yet due and payable or, if such
obligations are due and have not been paid, Liens securing such obligations
that are being diligently contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings (any such contests involving an amount in excess of $10 million
being described in the Global Disclosure Letter), (c) Liens for taxes,
assessments or other governmental charges or levies not yet due or which are
being contested in good faith, (d) Liens in connection with workmen\'s
compensation, unemployment insurance or other social security, old age
pension or public liability obligations not yet due or which are being
contested in good faith, (e) operators\', vendors\', suppliers of necessaries
to Global\'s drilling rigs and drillships, carriers\',
warehousemen\'s, repairmen\'s, mechanics\', workmen\'s, materialmen\'s,
construction or shipyard liens (during repair or upgrade periods) or other
like Liens arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of business or
statutory landlord\'s liens, each of which is in respect of obligations that
have not been outstanding more than 90 days (so long as no action has been
taken to file or enforce such Liens within said 90-day period) or which are
being contested in good faith and (f) other Liens disclosed in the Global
Disclosure Letter (the Liens described in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and
(f), collectively, "Global Permitted Liens"). No such asset is leased under
an operating lease from a lessor that, to Global\'s knowledge, has incurred
non-recourse indebtedness to finance the acquisition or construction of such
asset.   (b) As of the date hereof and except as would not have a
Global Material Adverse Effect, Global has caused the drilling rigs and
drillships listed in Global\'s most recent annual report on 10-K to be
maintained consistent with general practice in the offshore drilling
industry, and all such drilling rigs and drillships are in good operating
condition and repair consistent with general practice in the offshore
drilling industry.   Section 5.22 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Global
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether or not fixed, accrued, contingent or otherwise, except liabilities
and obligations that (i) are disclosed in the Global Reports filed prior  
18   to the date of this Agreement, (ii) are referred to in the Global
Disclosure Letter, or (iii) do not and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect.  
Section 5.23 Certain Contracts. (a) Section 5.23 of the Global Disclosure
Letter contains a list of all of the following contracts or agreements (other
than those set forth on an exhibit index in the Global Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement) to which Global or any Subsidiary of Global is a
party or by which any of them or their assets is bound as of the date of this
Agreement: (i) any non-competition agreement that purports to limit the
manner in which, or the localities in which, all or any portion of
their respective businesses is conducted, other than any such limitation that
is not material to Global and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and will
not be material to Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following
the Effective Time, (ii) any drilling rig construction or conversion contract
with respect to which the drilling rig has not been delivered and paid for,
(iii) any drilling contracts of one year or greater remaining duration
including fixed price customer options, (iv) any contract or agreement for
the borrowing of money with a borrowing capacity or outstanding indebtedness
of $50 million or more or (v) any "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) (all contracts or
agreements of the types described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred
to herein as "Global Material Contracts").   (b) As of the date of this
Agreement, each Global Material Contract is, to the knowledge of Global, in
full force and effect, and Global and each of its Subsidiaries have in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them
to date under each Global Material Contract to which it is a party, except
where such failure to be binding or in full force and effect or such failure
to perform does not and is not reasonably likely to create, individually or
in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters
as do not and are not reasonably likely to have a Global Material Adverse
Effect, neither Global nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has
received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor,
to the knowledge of Global, does there exist any condition which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such
a violation or default under) any Global Material Contract or (y) has
received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any
such Global Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder.
Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Global Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or violate any
Global Material Contract or permit any other party to a Global Material
Contract to exercise rights adverse to Global. Each Global Material Contract
is enforceable by Global or a Subsidiary of Global in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\' rights and general
principles of equity, except where such unenforceability is not reasonably
likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a Global Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 5.24 Capital Expenditure Program. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Global Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth in all
material respects, for each of Global\'s sustaining and life extension
capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures for all such programs
that were forecasted to be incurred in each of 2001 and 2002 on a monthly
basis, as   19   previously provided to Santa Fe. Global has no newbuild
rigs under construction or contracted to be built.   Section 5.25 Improper
Payments. No bribes, kickbacks or other improper payments have been made by
Global or any Subsidiary of Global or agent of any of them in connection with
the conduct of their respective businesses or the operation of their
respective assets, and neither Global, any Subsidiary of Global nor any agent
of any of them has received any such payments from vendors, suppliers or
other persons, where any such payment made or received is reasonably likely
to have a Global Material Adverse Effect.   ARTICLE 6   REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES  OF SANTA FE, SUB AND MERGER SUB   Except as set forth in
the disclosure letter delivered to Global by Santa Fe at or prior to the
execution hereof (the "Santa Fe Disclosure Letter") and making reference to
the particular subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being
taken, Santa Fe, Sub and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to Global that:   Section 6.1 Existence; Good Standing; Corporate
Authority. Each of Santa Fe, Sub and Merger Sub is a corporation duly
incorporated and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation. Santa Fe is duly qualified to do business and, to the extent
such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant jurisdiction, is in
good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of
the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of
its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified does not and is not reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
Section 10.9). Santa Fe has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. The copies of Santa Fe\'s memorandum of association and articles
of association and the comparable charter and organizational documents of Sub
and Merger Sub previously made available to Global are true and correct and
contain all amendments as of the date hereof.   Section 6.2 Authorization,
Validity and Effect of Agreements. Each of Santa Fe, Sub and Merger Sub has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which
it is a party. The consummation by each of Santa Fe, Sub and Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance by Santa Fe and
delivery by Sub of Santa Fe Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger, have been
duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of Santa Fe,
other than the approvals referred to in Section 6.20. This Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Santa Fe, Sub and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Santa Fe, Sub or Merger Sub, as
applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors\' rights and general principles of equity.   20    Section 6.3
Capitalization. The authorized share capital of Santa Fe consists of
600,000,000 Santa Fe Ordinary Shares. As of July 31, 2001, there were
115,483,594 Santa Fe Ordinary Shares issued, including 196,865
restricted shares, and 5,212,977 Santa Fe Ordinary Shares reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding Santa Fe options. All such issued Santa
Fe Ordinary Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The Santa Fe Ordinary Shares to
be issued in connection with the Merger, when issued in accordance with this
Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in
this Section 6.3, there are no outstanding shares, and there are no options,
warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible securities or other rights,
agreements or commitments which obligate Santa Fe or any of its Subsidiaries
to issue, transfer or sell any shares or other voting securities of Santa Fe
or any of its Subsidiaries. Santa Fe has no outstanding bonds, debentures,
notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) with the shareholders of Santa Fe on any matter.   Section 6.4
Subsidiaries. (a) Each of Santa Fe\'s Significant Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, to
the extent such concept or similar concept exists in the relevant
jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization, has the corporate or other entity power
and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure
to be so qualified or to be in good standing does not and is not reasonably
likely to have a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
ownership interests in, each of Santa Fe\'s Subsidiaries are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Santa Fe free and clear of all Liens.   (b) Sub and Merger
Sub. All of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned directly by
Sub, all of the outstanding capital stock of Sub is owned directly by Santa
Fe, and Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby and, as of the Effective Time, will have not
engaged in any activities other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will have 100 outstanding shares of its common stock, par value
$0.01 per share.   Section 6.5 Compliance with Laws; Permits. Except for
such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, do not or are not
reasonably likely to have a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect and except for
matters arising under Environmental Laws which are treated exclusively in
Section 6.13:   (a) Neither Santa Fe nor any Subsidiary of Santa Fe is in 
violation of any Applicable Laws and no claim is pending or, to the 
knowledge of Santa Fe, threatened with respect to any such matters. No 
condition exists which does or is reasonably likely   21    to constitute
a violation of or deficiency under any Applicable Law by  Santa Fe or any
Subsidiary of Santa Fe.   (b) Santa Fe and each Subsidiary of Santa Fe hold
all permits,  licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders,
franchises  and approvals of all governmental or regulatory authorities
necessary  for the conduct of their respective businesses (the "Santa Fe 
Permits"). All Santa Fe Permits are in full force and effect and there 
exists no default thereunder or breach thereof, and Santa Fe has no  notice
or actual knowledge that such Santa Fe Permits will not be  renewed in the
ordinary course after the Effective Time. No  governmental authority has
given, or to the knowledge of Santa Fe  threatened to give, any action to
terminate, cancel or reform any Santa  Fe Permit.   (c) Each drilling rig,
drillship or other drilling unit owned or  leased by Santa Fe or a subsidiary
of Santa Fe which is subject to  classification is in class according to the
rules and regulations of  the applicable classifying body and is duly and
lawfully documented  under the laws of its flag jurisdiction.   (d) Santa
Fe and each Subsidiary of Santa Fe possess all permits,  licenses, operating
authorities, orders, exemptions, franchises,  variances, consents, approvals
or other authorizations required for the  present ownership and operation of
all its real property or leaseholds  ("Santa Fe Real Property"). There exists
no material default or breach  with respect to, and no party or governmental
authority has taken or,  to the knowledge of Santa Fe, threatened to take,
any action to  terminate, cancel or reform any such permit, license,
operating  authority, order, exemption, franchise, variance, consent,
approval or  other authorization pertaining to the Santa Fe Real
Property.   Section 6.6 No Conflict. (a) Neither the execution and delivery
by Santa Fe, Sub and Merger Sub of this Agreement nor the consummation by
Santa Fe, Sub and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof will (i) subject to the approvals referred
to in Section 6.20, conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of
the memorandum of association or articles of association of Santa Fe or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Sub or Merger Sub; (ii) violate, or
conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties of Santa Fe or its Subsidiaries under, or result
in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or
otherwise result in a detriment to Santa Fe or any of its Subsidiaries under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit, lease, contract,
agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which Santa Fe
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Santa Fe or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or (iii)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section
6.6(b), contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any
provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding
upon or applicable to Santa Fe or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
matters described in clause (ii) or (iii) as do not and are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse
Effect.   22    (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Santa Fe, Sub
or Merger Sub of this Agreement nor the consummation by Santa Fe, Sub or
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms hereof will require any consent, approval or authorization of, or
filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority, other
than the Regulatory Filings and the filing of a listing application with the
NYSE pursuant to Section 7.9(a) and the filing of the resolutions relating to
the Santa Fe Amendments with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman
Islands, except for any consent, approval or authorization the failure of
which to obtain and for any filing or registration the failure of which to
make does not and is not reasonably likely to have a Santa Fe Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 6.7 SEC Documents. Santa Fe has filed with the SEC
all documents (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) required to be
so filed by it since January 1, 1999 pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14(a) and
15(d) of the Exchange Act, and has made available to Global each registration
statement, report, proxy statement or information statement (other than
preliminary materials) it has so filed, each in the form (including exhibits
and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively, the "Santa Fe
Reports"). As of its respective date, each Santa Fe Report (i) complied in
all material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading except for such statements, if any, as have been modified by
subsequent filings with the SEC prior to the date hereof. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Santa Fe Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Santa Fe and
its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Santa Fe Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations, cash flows or changes in shareholders equity, as the case may be,
of Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal year-end audit adjustments),
in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries included in the most recent Santa Fe
Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement that includes such a balance
sheet, including all notes thereto, as of the date of such balance sheet,
neither Santa Fe nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against
in, a balance sheet of Santa Fe or in the notes thereto prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied, other than liabilities or obligations which do not and are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 6.8 Litigation. Except as described in
the Santa Fe Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings pending against Santa Fe or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to Santa Fe\'s knowledge, threatened against Santa Fe or any
of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity or in any arbitration or similar
proceedings, before or by any U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. court,
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality or   23   any U.S.
or non-U.S. arbitral or other dispute resolution body, that are reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 6.9 Absence of Certain Changes. From December 31, 2000 to
the date of this Agreement, there has not been (i) any event or
occurrence that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Santa Fe Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) any material change by Santa Fe or any of its
Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, in any of its accounting methods,
principles or practices or any of its tax methods, practices or elections,
(iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
distribution in respect of any share capital of Santa Fe or any redemption,
purchase or other acquisition of any of its securities, except dividends on
Santa Fe Ordinary Shares at a rate of not more than $0.0325 per share per
quarter or (iv) any increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance,
severance, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock
option, stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice.   Section 6.10 Taxes. (a)
All Returns required to be filed by or with respect to Santa Fe and any of
its Subsidiaries (including any Return required to be filed by a
consolidated, combined or unitary group that included Santa Fe or any of its
Subsidiaries) on or prior to the date hereof have been duly filed on a timely
basis with the appropriate governmental authorities, except to the extent
that any failure to file does not and is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect,
and all taxes due with such Returns have been duly paid, or deposited in full
on a timely basis or adequately reserved for in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, except to the extent that any failure to pay

aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect. There are no past or present
facts, conditions or circumstances that interfere with the conduct of any of
their respective businesses in the manner now conducted or which interfere
with continued compliance with any Environmental Law, except for any non-
compliance or interference that is not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse
Effect.   26    (b) Except for such matters as do not and are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe
Material Adverse Effect, no judicial or administrative proceedings or
governmental investigations are pending or, to the knowledge of Santa Fe,
threatened against Santa Fe or its Subsidiaries that allege the violation of
or seek to impose liability pursuant to any Environmental Law, and there are
no past or present facts, conditions or circumstances at, on or arising out
of, or otherwise associated with, any current (or, to the knowledge of Santa
Fe or its Subsidiaries, former) businesses, assets or properties of Santa Fe
or any Subsidiary of Santa Fe, including but not limited to on-site or off-

or corrective action under any Environmental Law, (ii) claims arising for
personal injury, property damage or damage to natural resources, or (iii)

its Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to
use all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary
information used or held for use in connection with their respective
businesses as currently being conducted, except where the failure to own or
possess such licenses and other rights does not and is not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse
Effect, and there are no assertions or claims challenging the validity of any
of the foregoing that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect. The conduct of Santa Fe\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' respective businesses as currently conducted does not
conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark
rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe
Material Adverse Effect. There is no material infringement of any proprietary
right owned by or licensed by or to Santa Fe or any of its Subsidiaries that

not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect, Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries maintain
insurance coverage with financially responsible insurance  
27   companies in such amounts and against such losses as are customary in
the drilling services industry on the date hereof.   (b) Except for such
matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect, no event relating
specifically to Santa Fe or its Subsidiaries (as opposed to events affecting
the drilling services industry in general) has occurred that is reasonably
likely, after the date of this Agreement, to result in an upward adjustment
in premiums under any insurance policies they maintain. Excluding insurance
policies that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of
business, no excess liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance
policy has been canceled by the insurer within one year prior to the date
hereof, and to Santa Fe\'s knowledge, no threat in writing has been made
to cancel (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) any
such insurance policy of Santa Fe or any Subsidiary of Santa Fe during the
period of one year prior to the date hereof. Prior to the date hereof, no
event has occurred, including the failure by Santa Fe or any Subsidiary of
Santa Fe to give any notice or information or by giving any inaccurate or
erroneous notice or information, which materially limits or impairs the
rights of Santa Fe or any Subsidiary of Santa Fe under any such excess
liability, hull or protection and indemnity insurance policies.   Section
6.17 No Brokers. Santa Fe has not entered into any contract, arrangement or
understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation of
Global or Santa Fe to pay any finder\'s fees, brokerage or other like
payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Santa Fe
has retained Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation as its financial advisor,
the arrangements with which have been disclosed in writing to Global prior to
the date hereof.   Section 6.18 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Board

has good and marketable title to the drilling rigs and drillships listed in
Santa Fe\'s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, in each case free and
clear of all Liens except for (a) defects or irregularities of title or
encumbrances of a nature that   28   do not materially impair the
ownership or operation of these assets and which have not had and are not
reasonably likely to have a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect, (b) Liens that
secure obligations not yet due and payable or, if such obligations are due
and have not been paid, Liens securing such obligations that are being
diligently contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings (any such
contests involving an amount in excess of $10 million being described in the
Santa Fe Disclosure Letter), (c) Liens for taxes, assessments or
other governmental charges or levies not yet due or which are being contested
in good faith, (d) Liens in connection with workmen\'s compensation,
unemployment insurance or other social security, old age pension or public
liability obligations not yet due or which are being contested in good faith,
(e) operators\', vendors\', suppliers of necessaries to Santa Fe\'s drilling
rigs and drillships, carriers\', warehousemen\'s, repairmen\'s, mechanics\',
workmen\'s, materialmen\'s, construction or shipyard liens (during repair or
upgrade periods) or other like Liens arising by operation of law in the
ordinary course of business or statutory landlord\'s liens, each of which is
in respect of obligations that have not been outstanding more than 90 days
(so long as no action has been taken to file or enforce such Liens within
said 90-day period) or which are being contested in good faith and (f) other
Liens disclosed in the Santa Fe Disclosure Letter (the Liens described in
clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), collectively, "Santa Fe Permitted
Liens"). No such asset is leased under an operating lease from a lessor that,
to Santa Fe\'s knowledge, has incurred non-recourse indebtedness to finance
the acquisition or construction of such asset.   (b) As of the date hereof
and except as would not have Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect, Santa Fe has
caused the drilling rigs and drillships listed in Santa Fe\'s most recent
annual report on Form 10-K to be maintained consistent with general practice
in the offshore drilling industry, and all such drilling rigs and drillships
are in good operating condition and repair consistent with general practice
in the offshore drilling industry.   Section 6.22 Undisclosed Liabilities.

obligations of any nature, whether or not fixed, accrued, contingent or
otherwise, except liabilities and obligations that (i) are disclosed in the
Santa Fe Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) are referred
to in the Santa Fe Disclosure Letter, or (iii) do not and are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 6.23 Certain Contracts. (a) Section 6.23 of the Santa Fe
Disclosure Letter contains a list of all of the following contracts
or agreements (other than those set forth on an exhibit index in the Santa
Fe Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement) to which Santa Fe or
any Subsidiary of Santa Fe is a party or by which any of them or their assets
is bound as of the date of this Agreement: (i) any non-competition agreement
that purports to limit the manner in which, or the localities in which, all
or any portion of their respective businesses is conducted other than any
such limitation that is not, and will not be following the Effective Time,
material to Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any

drilling rig has not been delivered and paid for, (iii) any drilling
contracts of one year or greater remaining duration including fixed price

29   types described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to herein as
"Santa Fe Material Contracts").[B   (b) As of the date of this Agreement,
each Santa Fe Material Contract is, to the knowledge of Santa Fe, in full
force and effect, and Santa Fe and each of its Subsidiaries have in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them
to date under each Santa Fe Material Contract to which it is a party, except
where such failure to be binding or in full force and effect or such failure
to perform does not and is not reasonably likely to create, individually or
in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters
as do not and are not reasonably likely to have a Santa Fe Material Adverse
Effect, neither Santa Fe nor any of its Subsidiaries (x) knows of, or has
received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under (nor,
to the knowledge of Santa Fe, does there exist any condition which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would result in such a
violation or default under) any Santa Fe Material Contract or (y) has
received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to any
such Santa Fe Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such contract or exercise remedies thereunder.
Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not breach or violate
any Santa Fe Material Contract or permit any other party to a Santa Fe
Material Contract to exercise rights adverse to Santa Fe. Each Santa Fe
Material Contract is enforceable by Santa Fe or a Subsidiary of Santa Fe in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors\'
rights and general principles of equity, except where such unenforceability
is not reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a
Global Material Adverse Effect.   Section 6.24 Capital Expenditure Program.
As of the date of this Agreement, the Santa Fe Disclosure Letter accurately
sets forth in all material respects, for each of Santa Fe\'s sustaining, life
extension and newbuild capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures
for all such programs that were forecasted to be incurred from July 1, 2001

Global equal the projected total construction costs to complete such
newbuilds, as at the time of such forecast.   Section 6.25 Improper
Payments. No bribes, kickbacks or other improper payments have been made by
Santa Fe or any Subsidiary of Santa Fe or agent of any of them in connection
with the conduct of their respective businesses or the operation of their
respective assets, and neither Santa Fe, any Subsidiary of Santa Fe, nor any
agent of any of them has received any such payments from vendors, suppliers
or other persons, where any such payment made or received is reasonably
likely to have a Santa Fe Material Adverse Effect.   30    ARTICLE 7

faith opinion of its Board of  Directors after consultation with its outside
legal counsel the  following would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties,
(i) shall  not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
agreement  containing a standstill covenant to which it is a party; and
(ii)  during such period shall   33    enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law, the  provisions of such agreement, including
by obtaining injunctions to  prevent any breaches of such agreements and to
enforce specifically the  terms and provisions thereof in any court of the
United States of  America or any state having jurisdiction;   (q) shall not
take any action that would reasonably be  expected to result in (i) the
breach of any representation or warranty  contained herein, or (ii) any
condition in Article VIII not being  satisfied; and   (r) shall not (i)
agree in writing or otherwise to take  any of the foregoing actions or (ii)
permit any of its Subsidiaries to  agree in writing or otherwise to take any
of the foregoing actions that  refer to Subsidiaries.   Section 7.2 No
Solicitation by Global. (a) Global agrees that (i) neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and it shall not authorize or permit any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents or representatives (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or
any of its Subsidiaries) to, and on becoming aware of it will use its
reasonable best efforts to stop such person from continuing to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), or take any action designed to facilitate,
directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (including, without
limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to a
tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
purchase or similar transaction or series of transactions (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving, individually or in
the aggregate, 15% or more of the assets, net revenues or net income of
Global and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or 15% or more of any
class of capital stock of Global, including, without limitation, any merger
or similar transaction in which 15% or more of Global\'s capital stock is

transaction being hereinafter referred to as a "Global Acquisition Proposal")
or cooperate with or assist, participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations concerning a Global Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing;
provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Global or its
Board of Directors from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a Global Acquisition Proposal or (B) prior to the
Cutoff Date (as defined herein), providing information (pursuant to a
confidentiality and standstill agreement in reasonably customary form and
which does not contain terms that prevent Global from complying with its
obligations under this Section 7.2) to, or engaging in any negotiations
or discussions with, any person or entity who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Global Acquisition Proposal with respect to all the outstanding
capital stock of Global or all or substantially all the assets of Global (or
a merger or similar transaction in which 40% or more of Global\'s capital
stock is issued to a third party or its stockholders) that, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Global, taking into account the
likelihood of financing and consummation, after consultation with a financial
advisor of recognized national reputation, is superior to the Merger (a
"Global Superior Proposal"), to the extent the Board of Directors of Global,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.  
34    (b) Prior to taking any action referred to in Section 7.2(a), if
Global intends to participate in any such discussions or negotiations or
provide any such information to any such third party, Global shall
give prompt prior oral and written notice to Santa Fe of each such action.
Global will immediately notify Santa Fe orally and in writing of any such
requests for such information or the receipt of any Global Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could lead to a Global
Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the person or group engaging
in such discussions or negotiations, requesting such information or making
such Global Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of
any Global Acquisition Proposal. Global will (i) keep Santa Fe fully informed
of the status and details (including any changes or proposed changes to such
status or details) on a timely basis of any such requests, Global Acquisition
Proposals or inquiries and (ii) provide to Santa Fe as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to Global from any third party in

written notice under this Section 7.2 shall be given by facsimile with
receipt confirmed or personal delivery.   (c) Nothing in this Section 7.2
shall permit Global to enter into any agreement with respect to a Global
Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being agreed that
during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to Section 9.3(c)), Global
shall not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or in
any way facilitates, a Global Acquisition Proposal, other than a
confidentiality and standstill agreement in reasonably customary form and
which does not contain terms that prevent Global from complying with its
obligations under this Section 7.2.   (d) For purposes hereof, the "Cutoff
Date," when used with respect to Global, means the date the condition set
forth in Section 8.1(a)(i) is satisfied.   Section 7.3 No Solicitation by
Santa Fe. (a) Santa Fe agrees that (i) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and it shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives (including, without limitation, any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) to, and on becoming aware of it will use its reasonable best
efforts to stop such person from continuing to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic
information), or take any action designed to facilitate, directly or
indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (including, without limitation,
any proposal or offer to its shareholders) with respect to a tender or
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or
similar transaction or series of transactions (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving, individually or in
the aggregate, 15% or more of the assets, net revenues or net income of Santa
Fe and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or 15% or more of any class
of share capital of Santa Fe, including, without limitation, any merger or
similar transaction in which 15% or more of Santa Fe\'s share capital is
issued to a third party or its shareholders (any such proposal, offer or
transaction being hereinafter referred to as a "Santa Fe Acquisition
Proposal") or cooperate with or assist, participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning a Santa Fe Acquisition Proposal; and
(ii) it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing; provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
Santa Fe or its Board of Directors from   35   (A) complying with Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Santa Fe
Acquisition Proposal or (B) prior to the Cutoff Date (as defined herein),
providing information (pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement
in reasonably customary form and which does not contain terms that prevent
Santa Fe from complying with its obligations under this Section 7.3) to or
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person or entity who
has made an unsolicited bona fide written Santa Fe Acquisition Proposal with
respect to all the outstanding Santa Fe Ordinary Shares or all or
substantially all the assets of Santa Fe (or a merger or similar transaction
in which 40% or more of Santa Fe\'s share capital is issued to a third party
or its stockholders) that, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Santa Fe, taking into account the likelihood of financing and
consummation, after consultation with a financial advisor of recognized
national reputation, is superior to the Merger (a "Santa Fe Superior
Proposal"), to the extent that the Board of Directors of Santa Fe, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations   (b) Prior to
taking any action referred to in Section 7.3(a), if Santa Fe intends to
participate in any such discussions or negotiations or provide any such
information to any such third party, Santa Fe shall give prompt prior oral
and written notice to Global of each such action. Santa Fe will immediately
notify Global orally and in writing of any such requests for such information
or the receipt of any Santa Fe Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with

Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of any Santa Fe Acquisition
Proposal. Santa Fe will (i) keep Global fully informed of the status and
details (including any changes or proposed changes to such status or details)
on a timely basis of any such requests, Santa Fe Acquisition Proposals or
inquiries and (ii) provide to Global as soon as practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material
sent or provided to Santa Fe from any third party in connection with any
Santa Fe Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by Santa Fe to any
third party in connection with any Santa Fe Acquisition Proposal. Any written
notice under this Section 7.3 shall be given by facsimile with receipt
confirmed or personal delivery.   (c) Nothing in this Section 7.3 shall
permit Santa Fe to enter into any agreement with respect to a Santa Fe
Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being agreed that
during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to Section 9.4(c)), Santa
Fe shall not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or
in any way facilitates, a Santa Fe Acquisition Proposal, other than a
confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and which does not
contain terms that prevent Santa Fe from complying with its obligations under
this Section 7.3.   (d) For purposes hereof, the "Cutoff Date," when used
with respect to Santa Fe, means the date the condition set forth in
Section 8.1(a)(ii) is satisfied.   Section 7.4 Meetings of Stockholders.
(a) Each of Santa Fe and Global shall take all action necessary, in
accordance with applicable law and its memorandum of association and articles
of association (Santa Fe) or certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(Global), to convene a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable
to consider and vote upon (i) in   36   the case of Santa Fe, the
approval of the Santa Fe Amendments and the issuance of Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares pursuant to the Merger and (ii) in the case of Global, the adoption of
this Agreement. Santa Fe and Global shall coordinate and cooperate with
respect to the timing of such meetings and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to hold such meetings on the same day. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with the terms hereof, Global and Santa Fe shall each submit
this Agreement to its stockholders, whether or not the Board of Directors of
Global or Santa Fe, as the case may be, withdraws, modifies or changes
its recommendation and declaration regarding the foregoing matters.   (b)
Each of Santa Fe and Global, through its Board of Directors, shall recommend
approval of such matters and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of such matters; provided, however, that
the Board of Directors of Santa Fe or the Board of Directors of Global may at
any time prior to the Effective Time upon one business day\'s prior written
notice to Global or Santa Fe, respectively, (i) withdraw, modify or change
any recommendation and declaration regarding such matters or (ii) recommend
and declare advisable any Global Superior Proposal or Santa Fe Superior
Proposal, as the case may be, if in the good faith opinion of such Board of
Directors after consultation with its outside legal counsel the failure to
(x) so withdraw, modify or change its recommendation and declaration or (y)
so recommend and declare advisable any Global Superior Proposal or Santa Fe
Superior Proposal, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations.   Section 7.5 Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts,
Etc. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Global and
Santa Fe shall:   (i) make their respective required filings under the  HSR
Act and any applicable non-U.S. competition, antitrust or  premerger
notification laws ("Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws") to be  made pursuant to Section

with the U.K. Office of  Fair Trading (and shall share equally all filing
fees incident  thereto), which filings shall be made promptly, and which 
filings as required under the HSR Act shall be made in not  more than 15
business days from the date hereof, and  thereafter shall promptly make any
other required submissions  under the HSR Act or other such laws;   (ii)
use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate  with one another in (A)
determining which filings are required  to be made prior to the Effective
Time with, and which  consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are
required to  be obtained prior to the Effective Time from, governmental or 
regulatory authorities of the United States, the several  states, and
non-U.S. jurisdictions in connection with the  execution and delivery of this
Agreement, including, for the  avoidance of doubt, filing of a Merger Notice
with the U.K.  Office of Fair Trading, and the consummation of the Merger
and  the transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) timely making  all such
filings and timely seeking all such consents,  approvals, permits or
authorizations without causing a Santa  Fe Material Adverse Effect or a
Global Material Adverse  Effect;   37    (iii) promptly notify each
other of any communication  concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated  hereby to that party from any governmental authority and 
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed  communication
concerning this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby to any
governmental entity;   (iv) not agree to participate in any meeting or 
discussion with any governmental authority in respect of any  filings,
investigation or other inquiry concerning this  Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it  consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent  permitted by such governmental authority, gives the other 
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such  meeting or
discussion;   (v) furnish the other party with copies of all 
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda  setting forth the
substance thereof) between them and their  affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one  hand, and any government or regulatory authority
or members or  any such authority\'s staff on the other hand, with respect
to  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and   (vi)
furnish the other party with such necessary  information and reasonable
assistance as such other party and  its affiliates may reasonably request in
connection with their  preparation of necessary filings, registrations or
submissions  of information to any governmental or regulatory authorities, 
including, without limitation, any filings necessary or  appropriate under
the provisions of the HSR Act or any  applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws.  
(b) Without limiting Section 7.5(a), but subject to Section 7.5(c), Santa Fe
and Global shall:   (i) each use reasonable best efforts to avoid the 
entry of, or to have vacated, terminated or modified, any  decree, order or
judgment that would restrain, prevent or  delay the Closing; and   (ii)
each use reasonable best efforts to take any  and all steps necessary to
obtain any consents or eliminate  any impediments to the Merger.   (c)
Nothing in this Agreement shall require Santa Fe or Global to dispose of any
of its assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect to any of its
businesses, or to consent to any disposition of its assets or limits on its
freedom of action with respect to any of its businesses, whether prior to or
after the Effective Time, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, to
obtain any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations or to remove any
impediments to the Merger relating to the HSR Act, Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws or
other antitrust, competition or premerger notification, trade regulation law,
regulation or order ("Antitrust Laws") or to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or proceeding relating to Antitrust Laws, other
than dispositions, limitations or consents, commitments or agreements that in
each such case may be   38   conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and that in each such case do
not and are not reasonably likely individually or in the aggregate to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole as
constituted after the Effective Time of the Merger.   Section 7.6
Inspection. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of Global and
Santa Fe shall allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives of Santa Fe or Global, as the case may be, access, at
all reasonable times, upon reasonable notice, to the records and files,
correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating
to commitments, contracts, titles and financial position, or
otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of Santa Fe and Global and
their respective Subsidiaries, including inspection of such properties;
provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall affect any
representation or warranty given by any party hereunder, and provided further
that notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation by any
party, no party shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
party shall be required to provide any information which it reasonably
believes it may not provide to the other party by reason of applicable law,
rules or regulations, which constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep confidential by
reason of contract or agreement with third parties. The parties hereto shall
make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each
of Santa Fe and Global agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
respective representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 7.6 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All non-public
information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall be governed by the
Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement dated May 10, 2001 between Santa Fe
and Global (the "Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement").   Section 7.7
Publicity. The parties will consult with each other before issuing any press
release or public announcement pertaining to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement without the prior written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the
party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other
party before issuing any such press releases or making any such public
announcements.   Section 7.8 Registration Statement on Form S-4. (a) Each of
Santa Fe and Global shall cooperate and promptly prepare, and Santa Fe shall
file with the SEC, as soon as practicable, a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 (the "Form S-4") under the Securities Act with respect to the Santa Fe
Ordinary Shares issuable in the Merger, a portion of which Registration
Statement shall also serve as the joint proxy statement with respect to the
meetings of the stockholders of Santa Fe and of Global in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Proxy
Statement/Prospectus"). The respective parties will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations   39   thereunder. Santa Fe shall use
reasonable best efforts, and Global shall cooperate with Santa Fe, to have
the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Santa
Fe shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date
of the Form S-4, all necessary non-U.S., state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits or approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the parties shall share equally all expenses incident
thereto (including all SEC and other filing fees and all printing and mailing
expenses associated with the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus).
Santa Fe will advise Global, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Santa Fe Ordinary Shares issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. Each of the parties shall also promptly provide each other party
copies of all written correspondence received from the SEC and summaries of
all oral comments received from the SEC in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties shall promptly provide
each other party with drafts of all correspondence intended to be sent to the
SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
allow each such party the opportunity to comment thereon prior to delivery to
the SEC.   (b) Santa Fe and Global shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act.   (c) Each of Santa Fe and Global shall
ensure that the information provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of
mailing thereof and at the time of the respective meetings of stockholders of
Santa Fe and Global, or, in the case of information provided by it for
inclusion in the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time
it becomes effective, (i) will not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act.   Section 7.9 Listing Application. Santa Fe shall promptly prepare
and submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the Santa Fe Ordinary
Shares issuable in the Merger and shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for the listing of such Santa
Fe Ordinary Shares, subject to official notice of issuance.   Section 7.10
Letters of Accountants. (a) Global shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to Santa Fe "comfort" letters of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
Global\'s independent public accountants, dated within two business days of
the effective date of the Form S-4 and within two business days of the
Closing Date, respectively, and addressed to Santa Fe with regard to certain
financial information regarding Global included in the Form S- 4, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Santa Fe and customary in scope and substance for
"comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.   40    (b) Santa
Fe shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Global
"comfort" letters of Ernst and Young LLP, Santa Fe\'s independent public
accountants, dated within two business days of the effective date of the Form
S-4 and within two business days of the Closing Date, respectively, and
addressed to Global, with regard to certain financial information regarding
Santa Fe included in the Form S-4, in form reasonably satisfactory to Global
and customary in scope and substance for "comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements
similar to the Form S-4.   Section 7.11 Agreements of Rule 145 Affiliates.
Prior to the Effective Time, Global shall cause to be prepared and delivered
to Santa Fe a list identifying all persons who Global believes, at the date
of the meeting of Global\'s stockholders to consider and vote upon the
adoption of this Agreement, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Global, as
that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Global shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to
deliver to Santa Fe, at or prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement,
in the form of Exhibit 7.11. Santa Fe shall be entitled to place restrictive
legends on any Santa Fe Ordinary Shares issued to such Rule 145 Affiliates
pursuant to the Merger.   Section 7.12 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, except as expressly provided in Sections 7.5(a)(i)
and 7.8(a) of this Agreement or as otherwise agreed in writing by the
parties.   Section 7.13 Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, Santa Fe shall cause the Surviving Entity to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
each person who is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of Global (or any Subsidiary or division thereof) and
each person who served at the request of Global as a director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise, and each person
who is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, a party to a
written employee indemnification agreement with Global or any Subsidiary
thereof (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as
such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective
Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action"), (i) Santa Fe shall cause the Surviving Entity to
pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Entity, in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and, if required, upon receipt
of any undertaking required by applicable law, and (ii) Santa Fe and the
Surviving Entity will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), and provided further, that Santa Fe and the Surviving Entity
shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 7.13 to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of   41   any of the
Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two
or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate
counsel for each similarly situated group.   (b) The parties agree that the
rights to indemnification, including provisions relating to advances of
expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Global and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger.  
(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Santa Fe and the
Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time were, covered by Global\'s existing
officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policies on terms
substantially no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such
existing insurance, provided that Santa Fe and the Surviving Entity shall not
be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 150% of the last annual
premium paid by Global prior to the date hereof (the amount of which premium
is set forth in the Global Disclosure Letter), but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.   (d)
The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any
other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Global or any of its Subsidiaries, under
applicable law or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 7.13
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Parties.   (e) In the event Santa Fe, the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Santa Fe or the Surviving Entity, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.13.  
Section 7.14 Employee Matters. (a) At the Effective Time, Santa Fe will cause
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of all
of the employees of Global and its Subsidiaries initially at the
same salaries and wages of such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be considered a contract between Santa
Fe, the Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries and any employee or consideration
for, or inducement with respect to, any employee\'s continued employment and,
without limitation, all such employees are and will continue to be considered
to be employees at will pursuant to the applicable employment at will laws
or doctrines, subject to any express written agreement to the contrary with
such employee, and the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries will have the
right, in their discretion and subject to this Section 7.14, to alter the
salaries, wages and terms of employment of such employees at any time after
the Effective Time.   (b) With respect to each employee of Global and its
Subsidiaries ("Affected Employee"), Santa Fe shall cause the Surviving Entity
to deem the period of employment with Global and its Subsidiaries to have
been employment and service with Santa Fe for purposes of  
42   determining the Affected Employee\'s eligibility to join and vesting
(but not benefit accrual for any purpose other than vacation pay, sick leave
and life insurance) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies or
similar employment related arrangements of Santa Fe and its Subsidiaries in
which the Affected Employee is eligible to participate. Santa Fe shall waive,
and to the extent necessary to effect the terms hereof, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the relevant insurance carriers and other
third parties to waive, any restrictions and limitations for medical
conditions existing as of the Effective Time of those Affected Employees and
their dependents who were covered immediately prior to the Effective Time
under a group health plan maintained by Global, but only to the extent that
such medical condition would be covered by Santa Fe\'s or the Surviving
Entity\'s group health plan if it were not a pre-existing condition and only
to the extent that such limitations would not have applied under Global\'s
group health plan prior to the Effective Time. Further, Santa Fe shall cause
the Surviving Entity to offer at the Effective Time to each Affected Employee
coverage under a group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code) which credits such Affected Employee towards the deductibles,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions imposed under such group
health plan, for the year during which the Effective Time (or such later date
as the Affected Employees participate in such group health plan) occurs, with
any applicable expenses already incurred during such year under
Global\'s group health plan.   (c) Santa Fe and Global agree to cooperate
in good faith to (i) establish a process to promptly integrate their
compensation and benefit plans following the Effective Time and (ii) take
appropriate and substantially consistent actions to retain key employees and
provide for a smooth transition.   (d) Except with respect to offers of
employment to prospective new employees in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices and other than statements that merely repeat
or summarize the effects of this Agreement or the terms of agreements
identified in the disclosure schedules, Global and Santa Fe agree that they
will not make, or permit their Subsidiaries to make, any representations or
promises, oral or written, to their employees concerning continued employment
following the Effective Time, or the terms and conditions of that employment

bonus payments for employees of Global and its Subsidiaries in respect of
service during 2001 have not been paid prior to the Effective Date, Santa Fe

share award multiplied by the Merger Ratio.   (i) Santa Fe agrees to assume
the obligation of Global to issue an award of 250,000 restricted shares of

countersigned manually or by facsimile by the Secretary or another authorized
person, registered in the Register and signed manually by or on behalf of the

certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the Company,
whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate
or certificates have been delivered by the Company, such certificate or

receive within two months after allotment or lodgment of transfer (or within
such other period as the conditions of issue shall provide) one certificate
for all his shares or several certificates each for one or more of his shares
provided that in respect of a share or shares held jointly by several persons
the Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate and
delivery of a certificate for a share to one of the several joint holders
shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.   2.3 Notwithstanding
Section 2.1, if a share certificate be defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be
renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and the payment
of the expenses incurred by the Company in investigating evidence, as any
Director or officer of the Company may prescribe.   III. ISSUE OF SHARES  
3.1 The authorized share capital of the Company shall be as set forth in the
Memorandum represented by (i) Ordinary Shares of the Company (the
"Ordinary Shares") , with the rights as set forth in Article IV, and (ii)
such other classes or series of shares with the respective rights to be
determined upon the creation thereof by action of the Board of Directors from
time to time in accordance with Article V.   IV. ORDINARY SHARES   4.1
Subject to the provisions of the Articles, all unissued shares for the time
being in the capital of the Company shall be at the disposal of the Board of
Directors, and the Board of Directors may (subject as aforesaid) allot,
issue or grant any option, right, warrant or other security exercisable
for, convertible into, or exchangeable for, or otherwise dispose of, the
shares to such persons, on such terms and conditions and at such times as
they deem proper.   4.2 Dividends, whether to be paid in cash or to be
satisfied by distributions of property other than cash, will be made or paid
(as the case may be) on an equal per share basis (in all material respects)
to all holders of Ordinary Shares as of the record date fixed for such
dividend.   4.3 No holder of Ordinary Shares or any other shares of the
Company (unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the Company) shall, by
reason of such holding, have any preemptive or preferential right to
subscribe to or purchase any shares of any class or series of any shares of
the Company, now or hereafter to be authorized, or any notes, debentures,
bonds or other securities, whether or not the issuance of any such shares,
notes, debentures, bonds or other securities would adversely affect the
dividend, voting or any other rights of such holder.   4.4 Upon approval of
the Board of Directors, such number of Ordinary Shares, or other shares or
securities of the Company, as may be required for such purpose shall be
reserved for issuance in connection with any option, right, warrant or other
security of the Company or any other person that is exercisable for,
convertible into, exchangeable for or otherwise issuable in respect of such
Ordinary Shares or other shares or securities of the Company. Without
limiting the generality of Section 4.1 or the foregoing, the Board of  
4   Directors is expressly authorized and empowered to approve and enter
into a rights agreement between the Company and a rights agent pursuant to
which rights to purchase shares are granted to the holders of the Ordinary
Shares on such terms and for such purposes, including the influencing of
takeovers, as the Board of Directors shall in its absolute discretion
determine.   4.5 Unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors, any
shares which have been redeemed or repurchased by the Company shall have the
status of authorized but unissued shares and may be subsequently issued in
accordance with the Memorandum and the Articles.   4.6 The Board of
Directors shall have the fullest powers permitted by law to pay all or any
redemption or repurchase monies in respect of any shares out of the profits
and reserves of the Company, the Company\'s share capital and share premium
account.   V. OTHER CLASSES OR SERIES OF SHARES   5.1 Subject to Article
VI, the Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations
prescribed by law, to provide from time to time for the issuance of other
classes or series of shares, and in accordance with applicable procedures of
the Statute, to establish the characteristics of each class or series
including, without limitation, the following:   (a) the number of shares of
that class or series, which may  subsequently be increased or decreased (but
not below the number of shares  of that class or series then outstanding) by
resolution of the Board of  Directors, and the distinctive designation
thereof;   (b) the voting powers, full or limited, if any, of the shares of
that  class or series, including without limitation, the authority to
confer  multiple votes per share, voting rights as to specified matters or
issues  such as mergers, consolidations or sales of assets, or voting rights
to be  exercised either together with holders of Ordinary Shares as a
single  class, or independently as a separate class;   (c) the rights in
respect of dividends, if any, on the shares of that  class or series; the
rate at which such dividends shall be payable and/or  cumulate, which rate
may be determined on factors external to the Company  and which dividends may
be payable in cash, shares of capital or other  securities or property of the
Company; whether dividends shall be  cumulative and, if so, from which date
or dates; the relative rights or  priority, if any, of payment of dividends
on shares of that class or  series; and any limitation, restrictions or
conditions on the payment of  dividends;   (d) the relative amounts, and
the relative rights or priority, if any,  of payment in respect of shares of
that class or series, which the holder  of the shares of that class or series
shall be entitled to receive upon any  liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Company;   (e) any redemption, repurchase, retirement and sinking
fund rights,  preferences and limitations of that class or series, the amount
payable on  shares of that class or series in the event of such redemption,
repurchase  or retirement, the terms and   5    conditions of any
sinking fund, the manner of creating such fund or funds  and whether any of
the foregoing shall be cumulative or non-cumulative;   (f) the terms, if
any, upon which the shares of that class or series  shall be convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of any other classes,  or series, or other
securities, whether or not issued by the Company;   (g) the restrictions,
limitations and conditions, if any, upon  issuance of indebtedness of the
Company so long as any shares of that class  or series are outstanding;
and   (h) any other preferences and relative, participating, optional or 
other rights and limitations.   VI. VARIATION OF RIGHTS OF SHARES   6.1
(a) If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into different
classes or series of shares, the rights attached to any class or series
(unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class)
may, whether or not the Company is being wound-up, be varied with the consent
in writing of the holders of all of the issued shares of that class
or series, or with the sanction of a Special Resolution passed at a general
meeting with the holders of the shares of that class or series voting
separately as a class.   (b) The provisions of the Articles relating to
separate general meetings shall apply to every such general meeting of the
holders of one class or series of shares.   (c) Class or series meetings
and class or series votes may only be called at the direction of the Board of
Directors or upon the written request of Shareholders holding an aggregate of
at least 25% of the outstanding shares of such class or series of shares of
the Company (unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of such class or series).   6.2 The rights conferred upon the holders
of the shares of any class or series issued with preferred or other rights
shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of that class or series, be deemed to be varied by the creation or
issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith. The rights of the
holders of Ordinary Shares shall not be deemed to be varied by the granting
of rights to purchase Ordinary Shares to the holders of Ordinary Shares under
any rights agreement that may be entered into between the Company and a
rights agent in accordance with the provisions of these Articles or the issue
of Ordinary Shares pursuant to those rights. The entry into any such rights
agreement, the granting of such rights and the issue of Ordinary Shares
pursuant to such rights may be effected by the Directors without any consent
or vote of the holders of the Ordinary Shares.   VII. REPURCHASE OF ORDINARY
SHARES   7.1 Subject to the provisions of the Statute and the Memorandum,
the Company may at any time and from time to time purchase the Company\'s
issued Ordinary Shares by (i) agreement between the Company and any one or
more of its Shareholders holding   6   the Ordinary Shares to be
purchased, (ii) tender offer to all Shareholders or (iii) purchase on any
exchange or market on which the Ordinary Shares are traded, provided always
that, in each case, unless approved by Ordinary Resolution, the purchase
price is no greater than the then existing market price as determined by the
Directors by reference to the closing prices on the principal exchange or
market for the Ordinary Shares for a period of not less than one and not more
than ten consecutive trading days ending not more than three trading days
before such determination. In the event of a purchase by the Company of its
own Ordinary Shares on any exchange or market on which the Ordinary Shares
are traded, the manner of the purchase shall be in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the relevant exchange or market.   VIII. TRANSFER OF
SHARES   8.1 Upon surrender to the Company or the transfer agent of the
Company of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
evidence of transfer, and otherwise meeting all legal requirements for
transfer, it shall be the duty of the Company to cause the issue of a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and
record the transaction in the Register. Transfers of shares shall be made on
the books of the Company only by the registered holder thereof, or by such
holder\'s attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney filed with the
Secretary or the transfer agent. The Company shall be entitled to recognize
the exclusive right of a person registered in the Register as the owner of
shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner.   8.2 The holder of
any redeemable shares for which the Company has issued a notice of redemption
may not transfer such shares, whether or not the Company has yet paid the
redemption price to the Shareholder unless otherwise provided (i) by the
terms of such shares or (ii) by the Board of Directors in connection with the
redemption of such shares.   IX. NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUSTS OR OTHER
EQUITABLE OWNERSHIP   9.1 The Company shall not be required to recognize any
person as holding any share upon any trust (except the trustee(s) thereof)
and the Company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any way to recognize
(even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future, or
partial interest in any share, or any interest in any fractional part of a
share, or (except only as is otherwise provided by the Articles or the
Statute) any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to
the entirety thereof in the registered holder.   X. TRANSMISSION OF
SHARES   10.1 In case of the death of a Shareholder who is a natural person,
the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, and the
legal personal representatives of the deceased where he was a sole holder,
shall be the only persons recognized by the Company as having any title to
his interest in the shares, but nothing herein contained shall release the
estate of any such deceased holder from any liability in respect of any
shares which had been held by him solely or jointly with other persons.  
10.2 (a) Any person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death
or bankruptcy of a Shareholder (or in any way other than by transfer) may,
upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the
Board of Directors and subject as   7   hereinafter provided, elect
either to be registered himself as holder of the share or to make such
transfer of the share to such other person nominated by him as the deceased
or bankrupt person could have made and to have such person registered as the
transferee thereof, but the Board of Directors shall, in either case, have
the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in
the case of a transfer of the share by that Shareholder before his death or
bankruptcy as the case may be.   (b) If the person so becoming entitled
shall elect to be registered himself as holder he shall deliver or send to
the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects.  
10.3 A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death
or bankruptcy of the holder (or in any way other than by transfer) shall
be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would
be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share, except that he
shall not, before being registered as a Shareholder in respect of the share,
be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by share
ownership in relation to meetings of the Company; provided, however, that the
Board of Directors may at any time give notice requiring any such person to
elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share and if the
notice is not complied with within ninety days the Board of Directors may
thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other monies payable
in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have been
complied with.   XI. AMENDMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, 
CHANGE OF LOCATION OR REGISTERED OFFICE and ALTERATION OF CAPITAL   11.1 (a)
Subject to and insofar as permitted by the provisions of the Statute, the
Company may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amend the
Memorandum and Articles and may by Ordinary Resolution:   (i) increase the
share capital by such sum to be divided into shares  of such amount or
without nominal or par value as the resolution shall  prescribe;   (ii)
consolidate all or any of its share capital into shares of larger  amount
than its existing shares;   (iii) by subdivision of its existing shares or
any of them divide the  whole or any part of its share capital into shares of
smaller amount than  is fixed by the Memorandum; and   (iv) cancel any
shares which at the date of the passing of the  resolution have not been
taken or agreed to be taken by any person.   (b) All new shares created
hereunder shall be subject to the same provisions with reference to transfer,
transmission, and otherwise as provided in the Articles.   (c) Subject to
the provisions of the Statute, the Company may by Special Resolution reduce
its share capital or any capital redemption reserve fund.   8    11.2

Special Resolution change its name or alter its objects.   11.3 Subject to
the provisions of the Statute, the Company may by resolution of the Board of
Directors change the location of its registered office.   XII. CLOSING
REGISTER OF SHAREHOLDERS OR FIXING RECORD DATE   12.1 For the purpose of
determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
Shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or Shareholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend, or in order to make the determination of
Shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the
Company may provide that the Register shall be closed for transfers for a
stated period but not to exceed in any case forty days. If the Register shall
be so closed for the purpose of determining Shareholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders such register shall be so closed
for at least ten days immediately preceding such meeting and the record date
for such determination shall be the date of the closure of the Register.  
12.2 In lieu of or apart from closing the Register, the Board of
Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such
determination of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting
of the Shareholders, and for the purpose of determining the Shareholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend, the Board of Directors may fix a
subsequent date no later than the date of payment as the record date for such
dividend.   12.3 If the Register is not so closed and no record date is
fixed for the determination of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of Shareholders or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of a
dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on
which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is
adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination
of Shareholders. When a determination for Shareholders entitled to vote at
any meeting of Shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such
determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.   XIII. GENERAL
MEETING   13.1 (a) The Company shall in each year of its existence hold a
general meeting as its annual general meeting. The annual general meeting
shall be held at such time and place as the Board of Directors shall
appoint.   (b) At each annual general meeting, the Directors to be elected
at that meeting shall be elected for the applicable term or until their
respective successors have been elected and have qualified.   13.2 (a)
Except as otherwise required by law, and subject to the terms of any class or
series of shares issued by the Company having a preference over the Ordinary
Shares as to dividends or upon liquidation or to elect directors in specified
circumstances, extraordinary general meetings of the Shareholders of the
Company may be called only (i) by the Board of   9   Directors or (ii)
upon the written request of Shareholders holding at least 35% of the
outstanding Ordinary Shares generally entitled to vote.   (b) Any action
required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders of the Company must be
taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of the
Shareholders of the Company and may not be taken by consent of
the Shareholders in writing or otherwise.   XIV. NOTICE OF GENERAL
MEETINGS   14.1 Written notice of each meeting of the Shareholders stating
the place, date and time of the meeting shall be given not less than fifteen
nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each Shareholder
entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice of any extraordinary meeting of
Shareholders shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called. Business transacted at any extraordinary meeting shall be limited to
the purposes stated in the notice.   14.2 The accidental omission to give
notice of a general meeting to, or the non-receipt of notice of a general
meeting by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings of that meeting.   XV. PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS   15.1
No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of
Shareholders is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to
business. Subject to the proviso below, one or more Shareholders present in
person or by proxy holding at least a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting shall constitute a
quorum; provided that the quorum for any meeting at which a Special
Resolution is to be considered and voted upon pursuant to Sections 18.8(c),
19.1(c), 33.8, 34.7 or 35.5 shall be one or more Shareholders present in
person or by proxy holding at least a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and, for so long as
members of the KPC Affiliated Group own, in the aggregate, at least four
percent (4%), (i) of the voting power of Outstanding Voting Stock, or (ii) of
all the outstanding Ordinary SHARES, one of such Shareholders present is SFIC
Holdings (a "Special Quorum"). The Shareholders present at a duly constituted
general meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, despite
the withdrawal of enough Shareholders to leave less than a quorum, or, as the
case may be, Special Quorum. If a meeting is adjourned for lack of quorum,
or, as the case may be, Special Quorum, it will stand adjourned to such other
day at such other time and place as the Board of Directors may determine and
at which a quorum or, as the case may be, Special Quorum is present in person
or by proxy.   15.2 (a) Subject to the terms of any class or series of
shares issued by the Company, if a Shareholder desires to nominate persons
for election as Directors at any general meeting duly called for the election
of Directors, written notice of such Shareholder\'s intent to make such a
nomination must be given and received by the Secretary of the Company at the
principal executive offices of the Company not later than (i) with respect to
an annual general   10   meeting of Shareholders, ninety days in advance
of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual general meeting
and (ii) with respect to an extraordinary general meeting, the close of
business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of such meeting
is first sent or given to Shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth (i)
the name and address, as it appears in the Register of the Company, of the
Shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons
to be nominated; (ii) a representation that the Shareholder is a holder of
record of shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and intends
to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice; (iii) the class and number of shares of the
Company which are beneficially owned by the Shareholder; (iv) a description
of all arrangements or understandings between the Shareholder and each
nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or
persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by
the Shareholder; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed
by such Shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement
filed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended from time to time, of the United States of America, whether or not
the Company is then subject to such Regulation; and (vi) the consent of each
nominee to serve as a Director of the Company, if so elected. The Chairman of
the annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting shall, if the
facts warrant, refuse to acknowledge a nomination not made in compliance with
the foregoing procedure, and any such nomination not properly brought before
the meeting shall not be considered.   (b) Subject to the terms of any
class or series of shares issued by the Company, if a Shareholder desires to
submit a proposal for consideration by the Shareholders at any general
meeting, written notice of such Shareholder\'s intent to submit such a
proposal must be given and received by the Secretary of the Company not later
than (i) with respect to an annual general meeting of Shareholders, ninety
days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
general meeting; and (ii) with respect to an extraordinary general meeting,
the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of
such meeting is sent or given to Shareholders. Each such notice shall set
forth (i) the name and address, as it appears in the Register, of
the Shareholder who intends to submit the proposal; (ii) a representation
that the Shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Company entitled
to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the
meeting to submit the proposal specified in the notice; (iii) the class and
number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by the
Shareholder; and (iv) such other information regarding each proposal
submitted by such Shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy
statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended from time to time, of the United States of America,
whether or not the company is then subject to such Regulation. The Chairman
of the annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting shall, if the
facts warrant, refuse to acknowledge a proposal not made in compliance with
the foregoing procedure, and any such proposal not properly brought before
the meeting shall not be considered.   15.3 The Chairman of the Board, or
any Director designated by the Board of Directors, shall preside as Chairman
at every general meeting of the Company, or if there is no such Chairman, or
if he or such designee shall not be present within one hour after the time
appointed for the holding of the meeting, or is unwilling to act, the
Directors present shall elect one of their number to be Chairman of the
meeting.   11    15.4 If at any general meeting no Director is willing to
act as Chairman or if no Director is present within one hour after the time

an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or
insanity of the principal or revocation of the proxy or of the authority
under which the proxy was executed, or the transfer of the share in respect

death, insanity, revocation or transfer as aforesaid shall have been received
by the Company at the office before the commencement of the general, meeting,
or adjourned meeting at which it is sought to use the proxy.   16.5 Any
corporation which is a Shareholder of record of the Company may in accordance
with its articles of association or other governing documents or in the
absence of such provision by resolution of its board of directors or
other governing body authorize one or more persons as it thinks fit to act as
its representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company or of any
class or series of Shareholders of the Company, and the person or persons
so authorized shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of
the corporation which he or they represent as the corporation could exercise
if it were an individual Shareholder of record of the Company and may cast
votes or abstain on any motion in any manner as he or they may be
directed.   XVII. DIRECTORS   17.1 (a) The Board of Directors shall
consist of not less than six nor more than fifteen persons. Subject to
Section 17.1(c), the Board of Directors shall have the exclusive power and
right to set the exact number of Directors within that range from time to
time by resolution adopted by the vote of a majority of the whole Board of
Directors. Until the Board of Directors adopts such a resolution, the exact
number of Directors shall be fourteen.   (b) Upon the date that these
Articles are adopted, the Directors shall by resolution of the Board of
Directors be divided into three classes of equal size, designated as Class I,
Class II and Class III, each class to be comprised of at least three
Directors; provided, however, if the total number of Directors is 10, 11, 13
or 14, one Class may have one fewer or one more Director than the other two
Classes. The Board of Directors shall make the subsequent appointments of
individual Directors to particular Classes. Upon the date that these
Articles are adopted, the Directors then appointed to Class I will hold
office for a term expiring at the 2004 annual general meeting of
Shareholders; the Directors then appointed to Class II will hold office for a
term expiring at the 2002 annual general meeting of Shareholders; and the
Directors then appointed to Class III will hold office for a term expiring at
the 2003 annual general meeting of Shareholders. At each annual general
meeting of Shareholders, the successors of the class of Directors whose terms
expire at that meeting shall be of the same class as the Directors they
succeed and shall be elected for three-year terms.   13    (c) No
resolution of the Board of Directors may be adopted if its effect would be to
remove from office, or shorten the term of, any incumbent Director.   (d) A
Director shall hold office until the annual general meeting for the year in
which his term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall
qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement or removal
from office. Any newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the
number of Directors and any other vacancy on the Board of Directors, however
caused, may be filled by a majority vote of the Directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director. Any Director
elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy shall hold office until
the annual general meeting of Shareholders for the year in which the term of
the Director vacating office expires and until his successor shall have
been elected and qualified. Any newly created directorship resulting from an
increase in the number of Directors may be created in any class of Directors
that the Board of Directors may determine, and any Director elected to fill
the newly created vacancy shall hold office until the term of office of such
class expires.   (e) One or more or all of the Directors of the Company may
be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
a majority of the outstanding shares generally entitled to vote, voting
together as a single class, at a meeting of Shareholders for which proper
notice of the proposed removal has been given.   (f) If at any time the
number of Directors is less than six, the Board of Directors may act to fill
any vacancies on the Board of Directors.   17.2 The Board of Directors shall
have the authority to fix the compensation of Directors, which may include
their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of
Directors or of a committee.   17.3 A Director may hold any other office or
place of profit under the Company in conjunction with his office of Director
for such period and on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the
Board of Directors may determine.   17.4 A Director may act by himself or
his firm in a professional capacity for the Company and he or his firm shall
be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a
Director.   17.5 (a) No share ownership qualification for Directors shall be
required.   (b) No person shall serve as a Director of the Company who at
the time of his or her election has reached his or her 70th birthday.

officer of or otherwise interested in any company promoted by the Company or
in which the Company may be interested as shareholder or otherwise and no
such Director shall be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or
other benefits received by him as a director or officer of, or from his
interest in, such other company.   14    17.7 No person shall be
disqualified from the office of Director or prevented by such office from
contracting with the Company, either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise, nor
shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on
behalf of the Company in which any Director shall be in any way interested or
be liable to be avoided, nor shall any Director so contracting or being so
interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realized by any
such contract or transaction by reason of such Director holding office or of
the fiduciary relation thereby established. A Director shall be at liberty to
vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is so interested
as aforesaid; provided, however, that the nature of the interest of any
Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or
prior to its consideration and any vote thereon.   17.8 A general notice
that a Director is an officer, director or shareholder of any specified firm
or company and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction with such
firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure under Section 17.7 and after
such general notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating
to any particular transaction.   XVIII. POWERS AND DUTIES OF DIRECTORS  
18.1 The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by the Board of
Directors who may exercise all such powers of the Company and do all
such lawful acts and things as are not from time to time by the Statute or by
the Articles required to be exercised or done by the Company in general
meeting.   18.2 The Board of Directors may from time to time and at any time
by powers of attorney appoint any company, firm, person or body of persons,
whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Board of Directors, to be the

to such conditions as it may think fit, and any such powers of attorney may
contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing
with any such attorneys as the Board of Directors may deem fit and may also

held any other salaried office or place of profit with the Company or to his
widow or dependents and may make contributions to any fund and pay premiums
for the purchase or provision of any such gratuity, pension or allowance.

liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.   18.7 Board

notice of its consent or withholding of consent to the action specified in
the notice. In the event that SFIC Holdings fails to deliver to the

as otherwise provided by the Articles, the Board of Directors shall meet
together for the dispatch of business, convening, adjourning and otherwise
regulating its meetings as it thinks fit. Subject to Section 24.1, questions

these Articles, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of,
any special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice

of a Director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except when a Director attends for the express purpose of objecting
to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.   19    20.3 The Chairman of the Board shall
preside as Chairman at every meeting of the Board of Directors. In the event

20.6 Members of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may participate in a meeting of the Board or of such committee by means
of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which

participation in a meeting pursuant to this provision shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.   20.7 A resolution in writing (in one
or more counterparts) signed by all the Directors for the time being or all
the members of a committee of Directors shall be as valid and effectual as if
it had been passed at a meeting of the Board of Directors or committee as the
case may be duly convened and held.   XXI. VACATION OF OFFICE OF
DIRECTOR  21.1 The office of a Director shall be vacated:   (a) If he

company;   20    (ii) to reorganize or reconstruct itself pursuant to a
plan sanctioned  by the Cayman Islands courts; or   (iii) to sell, lease or
exchange all or substantially all of the  assets of the Company;  provided

such transaction of the Company with any entity which the Company,
directly or indirectly, controls, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended from time to time, of the United States of America,
unless the Company is not the surviving entity in such transaction or the
Company transfers all or substantially all of its assets in such transaction
and provided further that the foregoing shall be without prejudice to the
requirement for such statutory majorities and approvals as may be
necessary.   XXIII. SEAL   23.1 The Company may have a seal, and the seal
may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed
or reproduced or otherwise. Any Director or officer of the Company will have
the authority to affix the seal to any document requiring it. The Company may
have for use in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands, a duplicate
seal or seals each of which shall be a facsimile of the common seal of the
Company and, if the Directors so determine, with the addition on its face of
the name of every place where it is to be used.   XXIV. OFFICERS   24.1
The officers of the Company shall be appointed by the Board of Directors and
shall include a Chairman of the Board, a Chief Executive Officer, a
President, a Secretary and a Treasurer and may also include one or more
Vice Chairmen, Senior and Executive Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents,
Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers. The Board of Directors may
also choose such other officers and agents as it shall deem necessary or
desirable and such persons shall hold their offices for such terms and shall
exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined by the
Board of Directors from time to time. Two or more offices may be held by the
same person. None of the officers other than the Chairman of the Board need
be a Director of the Company, and none of the officers need be a Shareholder
of the Company. No officer shall be prevented from receiving compensation as
an officer by reason of his also being a Director. The officers of the
Company shall hold office until their successors are elected or appointed and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal. Any officer elected or appointed by the Board of
Directors may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Board of
Directors, provided, however that until the third anniversary of the date
these Articles are adopted, a vote of two-thirds of the whole Board of
Directors shall be required (i) to remove the Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer or the President, and (ii) to authorize
any modification, amendment or termination of (A) the employment agreement
dated August 31, 2001 between the Company and Robert E. Rose or (B) the
employment agreement dated August 31, 2001 between the Company and C. Stedman
Garber. Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Company. Any such resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of
such notice or at such other time specified therein, and unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of   21   such resignation shall not
be necessary to make it effective. Election or appointment of an officer
shall not of itself create contract rights.   24.2 Any provision of the
Statute or the Articles requiring or authorizing a thing to be done by a
Director and an officer shall not be satisfied by its being done by the one
person acting in the dual capacity of Director and officer.   XXV.
DIVIDENDS AND RESERVES   25.1 Subject to the Statute, the Board of Directors
may from time to time declare dividends on shares of the Company outstanding
and authorize payment of the same out of the profits of the Company (realized
or unrealized), share premium account, or any other account permitted by the
Statute, and may from time to time pay to the Shareholders such interim
dividends, as appears to the Board of Directors to be appropriate.   25.2
The Board of Directors may declare that any dividend be paid wholly or partly
by the distribution of shares or other securities of the Company
and/or specific assets and in particular of paid up shares, debentures, or
debenture stock of any other company or in any one or more of such ways and
where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Board of
Directors may settle the same as it deems expedient and in particular may
issue fractional shares and fix the value for distribution of such specific
assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made
to any Shareholders upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to adjust
the rights of all Shareholders and may vest any such specific assets in
trustees as may seem expedient to the Board of Directors.   25.3 No
dividend shall bear interest against the company unless expressly authorized
by the Board of Directors.   XXVI. CAPITALIZATION   26.1 The Company may
upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors capitalize any sum standing
to the credit of any of the Company\'s reserve accounts (including share
premium account and capital redemption reserve fund) or any sum standing to
the credit of profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution
and to appropriate such sum to Shareholders in the proportions in which such
sum would have been divisible amongst them had the same been a distribution
of profits by way of dividend and to apply such sum on their behalf in paying
up in full unissued shares (not being redeemable shares) for allotment and
distribution credited as fully paid up to and amongst then in the proportion
aforesaid. In such event the Board of Directors shall do all acts and things
required to give effect to such capitalization, with full power to the Board
of Directors to make such provisions as it thinks fit for the case of shares
becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions whereby the benefit
of fractional entitlements accrue to the Company rather than to
the Shareholders concerned).   XXVII. INDEMNITY AND LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY   27.1 (a) The Company shall indemnify, except in respect of
wilful default or fraud, to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by
law, any person (including his heirs, executors and administrators) who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any  
22   threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including, without
limitation, an action by or in the right of the Company), by reason of his
acting as, or having in the past acted as, a Director, officer, employee or
agent of, or his acting in any other capacity for or on behalf of, the
Company (including his serving for, on behalf of or at the request of the
Company as a director, officer employee or agent of another company,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or in a fiduciary or
other capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by the
company) against any expense (including attorney\'s fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person (or his heirs, executors and administrators) in respect thereof. The
Company shall advance the expenses of defending any such action, suit or
proceeding (including appeals) in accordance with and to the full extent now
or hereafter permitted by law.   (b) The Board of Directors may,
notwithstanding any interest of the Directors in such action, authorize the
Company to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person described
in Section 27.1(a), against any liability asserted against him and incurred
by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or
not the Company would have the power to indemnify him against such liability
under the provisions of this Article XXVII.   (c) The provisions of this
Article XXVII shall be applicable to all actions, claims, suits or
proceedings made or commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from
acts or omissions to act occurring before or after its adoption. The
provisions of this Article XXVII shall be deemed to be a contract between the
Company and each Director, officer, employee or agent who serves in such
capacity at any time while this Article XXVII and the relevant provisions of
the law, if any, are in effect, and any repeal or modification thereof shall
not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state
of facts or any action, suit or proceeding then or theretofore existing, or
any action, suit or proceeding thereafter brought or threatened based in
whole or in part on any such state of facts.  If any provision of this
Article XXVII shall be found to be invalid or limited in application by
reason of any law or regulation, it shall not affect any other application of
such provision or the validity of the remaining provisions hereof. The rights
of indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in this Article XXVII
shall neither be exclusive of, nor be deemed in limitation of, any rights to
which any such officer, Director, employee or agent may otherwise be entitled
or permitted by contract, vote of Shareholders or Directors or otherwise, or
as a matter of law, both as to actions in his official capacity and actions
in any other capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the
Company that indemnification of the specified individuals, except in respect
of wilful default or fraud, shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by
law.   XXVIII. BOOKS AND RECORDS   28.1 In addition to any rights which
may be conferred on Shareholders by Statute, upon written demand under oath
stating the purpose thereof, any Shareholder may review for any proper
purpose, during usual hours for business, the books and records of the
Company, including without limitation, the Register. A proper purpose shall
mean a purpose reasonably related to such person\'s interest as a
Shareholder.   23    XXIX. WINDING UP   29.1 In the event of any
liquidation or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary,
after there shall have been paid or set aside for payment to the holders of
any outstanding shares ranking senior to the Ordinary Shares as to
distribution on liquidation, distribution or winding up, the full amounts to
which they shall be entitled, the holders of the then outstanding Ordinary
Shares shall be entitled to receive, pro rata according to the number of
Ordinary Shares registered in the names of such Shareholders, any
remaining assets of the Company available for distribution to its
Shareholders; provided, if, at such time, the holder of Ordinary Shares has
any outstanding debts, liabilities or engagements to or with the Company
(whether presently payable or not), either alone or jointly with any other
person, whether a Shareholder or not (including, without limitation, any
liability associated with the unpaid purchase price of such Ordinary Shares),
the liquidator appointed may deduct from the amount payable in respect of
such Ordinary Shares the aggregate amount of such debts, liabilities and
engagements and apply such amount to any of such holder\'s debts, liabilities
or engagements to or with the Company (whether presently payable or not). The
liquidator may distribute, in kind, to the holders of the Ordinary Shares the
remaining assets of the Company or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
all or any part of such remaining assets to any other person, corporation,
trust or entity and receive payment therefor in cash, shares or obligations
of such other person, corporation, trust or entity or any combination
thereof, and may sell all or any part of the consideration so received, and
may distribute the consideration received or any balance or proceeds thereof
to holders of the Ordinary Shares. The liquidator may, with the like
authority, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon
such trusts for the benefit of the holders of the Ordinary Shares as the
liquidator, with the like authority shall think fit, but so that no
Shareholder shall be compelled to accept any shares or other securities
whereon there is any liability.   XXX. DEREGISTRATION   30.1 (a) Subject
to Section 18.8(a), the Company may by Special Resolution resolve to be
registered by way of continuation in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman
Islands or such other jurisdiction in which it is for the time
being incorporated, registered or existing; and   (b) In furtherance of a
resolution adopted pursuant to (a) above of this Section 30.1 and subject as
aforesaid, the Directors may cause an application to be made to the Registrar
of Companies to deregister the Company in the Cayman Islands or such other
jurisdiction in which it is for the time being incorporated, registered or
existing and may cause all such further steps as they consider appropriate to
be taken to effect the transfer by way of continuation of the Company.  
XXXI. FISCAL YEAR   31.1 Each Fiscal Year shall commence on such date as may
be specified by the Board of Directors.   24    XXXII. NOTICES   32.1
Notices shall be in writing and may be given by the Company to
any Shareholder either personally or by sending it by post, air courier,
cable, facsimile transmission or telex to him or to his address as shown in
the Register, such notice, if mailed, to be forwarded by airmail where
practicable. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been effected on the
date the letter containing the same is posted as aforesaid, or sent by air
courier, cable, facsimile transmission or telex.   32.2 A notice shall be
given by the Company to the joint holders of record of a share by giving the
notice to all joint holders named on the Register in respect of the
share.   32.3 A notice may be given by the Company to the person or persons
which the Company has been advised are entitled to a share or shares in
consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Shareholder by sending it through
the post as aforesaid in a prepaid letter addressed to them by name, or by
the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankruptcy,
or by any like description at the address supplied for that purpose by the
persons claiming to be so entitled, or at the option of the Company by giving
the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the death
or bankruptcy had not occurred.   32.4 Notice of every general meeting
shall be given in any manner hereinbefore authorized to:   (a) every holder
of voting shares as shown in the Register as of the  record date for such
meeting;   (b) every person upon whom the ownership of a voting share
devolves by  reason of his being a legal personal representative or a trustee
in  bankruptcy of a holder of voting shares of record where such holder but
for  his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the
meeting;  and  except as otherwise required by law or the Articles, no
other person shall be entitled to receive notice of general meetings.  
XXXIII. CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES   33.1 In anticipation that the Company and
the members of the KPC Affiliated Group (as defined below) may engage in the
same or similar activities or lines of business and have an interest in the
same areas of corporate opportunities, and in recognition of the benefits to
be derived by the Company through its continued contractual, corporate and
business relations with the members of the KPC Affiliated Group (including
service of officers and directors of the members of the KPC Affiliated Group
as Directors of the Company), the provisions of this Article XXXIII are set
forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the Company as
they may involve the members of the KPC Affiliated Group and their officers
and directors, and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the Company
and its officers, Directors and Shareholders in connection therewith.  
25    33.2 The members of the KPC Affiliated Group shall have the right to,
and shall have no duty not to, (i) engage in the same or similar business
activities or lines of business as the Company, (ii) do business with any
client or customer of the Company and (iii) employ or otherwise engage any
officer or employee of the Company, and no member of the KPC Affiliated Group
nor any officer or director thereof (except as provided in Section 33.3)
shall be liable to the Company or its Shareholders by reason of any such
activities of the KPC Affiliated Group or of such person\'s participation
therein. In the event that a member of the KPC Affiliated Group acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate
opportunity for both such member of the KPC Affiliated Group and the Company,
such member of the KPC Affiliated Group shall be under no obligation to
communicate or present such corporate opportunity to the Company and shall
not be liable to the Company or its Shareholders by reason of the fact that
such member of the KPC Affiliated Group pursues or acquires such corporate
opportunity for itself, directs such corporate opportunity to another person
or entity, or does not present such corporate opportunity to the Company.  
33.3 In the event that a Director or officer of the Company who is also
a director or officer of a member of the KPC Affiliated Group acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate
opportunity for both the Company and any member of the KPC Affiliated Group,
such Director or officer of the Company shall not be liable to the Company or
its Shareholders by reason of the fact that such member of the KPC Affiliated
Group pursues or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself or directs
such corporate opportunity to another person or does not present such
corporate opportunity to the Company, except for willful default or fraud of
such Director or officer, if such Director or officer acts in a manner
consistent with the following policy:   (a) a corporate opportunity offered
to any person who is an officer of  the Company and who is also a director
but not an officer of a member of  the KPC Affiliated Group shall first be
offered to the Company, unless such  opportunity is expressly offered to such
person solely in his capacity as a  director of such member of the KPC
Affiliated Group in which case such  opportunity shall first be offered to
such member of the KPC Affiliated  Group;   (b) a corporate opportunity
offered to any person who is a Director  but not an officer of the Company
and who is also a director or officer of  a member of the KPC Affiliated
Group shall first be offered to the Company  only if such opportunity is
expressly offered to such person solely in his  capacity as a Director of the
Company, and otherwise shall first be offered  to such member of the KPC
Affiliated Group; and   (c) a corporate opportunity offered to any person
who is an officer of  both the Company and a member of the KPC Affiliated
Group shall first be  offered to such member of the KPC Affiliated Group
unless (x) such person  is an employee of the Company or (y) such opportunity
is expressly offered  to such person solely in his capacity as an officer of
the Company, in  either of which case such opportunity shall first be offered
to the  Company.   33.4 For the purposes of this Article XXXIII, "corporate
opportunities" shall include, but not be limited to, business opportunities
which the Company is financially able to   26   undertake, which are,
from their nature, in the line of the Company\'s business, are of practical
advantage to it and are ones in which the Company has an interest or a
reasonable expectancy, and in which, by embracing the opportunities, the
self-interest of a member of the KPC Affiliated Group or its officers or
directors, will be brought into conflict with that of the Company.   33.5
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares
shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of
this Article XXXIII.   33.6 For purposes of this Article XXXIII, and, to
the extent set forth therein, Article XXXIV and Article XXXV and, in relation
to the definition of "KPC Affiliated Group" only, Article I:   (a) the
members of the "KPC Affiliated Group" shall mean,  collectively, Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation, a company organized under the  laws of Kuwait ("KPC"),
SFIC Holdings (Cayman), Inc., a Cayman Islands  company ("SFIC Holdings"),
and all corporations, partnerships, joint  ventures, limited liability

without limitation any entity in which KPC or  SFIC Holdings owns (directly
or indirectly) fifty percent (50%) or more of  the outstanding voting shares
or stock, voting power, partnership interests  or similar ownership
interests, and all successors to KPC, SFIC Holdings  and their affiliates by
way of merger, consolidation or sale of all or  substantially all of its
assets, but shall not include the Company (as  defined in clause (b) below);
and   (b) the "Company" shall mean the Company and all corporations, 
partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies, trusts,

or stock, voting power, partnership interests or similar ownership 
interests.   33.7 If any contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction
between the company and a member of the KPC Affiliated Group involves a
corporate opportunity and is approved in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Article XXXIV, the officers and directors of such member of the KPC
Affiliated Group shall, for purposes of these Articles, not be liable to the
Company or its Shareholders, except for wilful default or fraud on the part
of the relevant officer or director.   33.8 The provisions of this Section
33, including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 33.8, may
only be altered or amended by a Special Resolution passed at a meeting of the
Company at which a Special Quorum of Shareholders is present.   XXXIV.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED ENTITIES   34.1 In anticipation that (i) the
Company and the members of the KPC Affiliated Group may enter into contracts
or otherwise transact business with each other and that   27   the
Company and the members of the KPC Affiliated Group may derive
benefits therefrom and (ii) the Company may from time to time enter into
contractual, corporate or business relations with one or more of its
Directors, or one or more corporations, partnerships, associations or other
organizations in which one or more of its Directors have a financial interest
(collectively, "Related Entities"), the provisions of this Article XXXIV are
set forth to regulate and define certain contractual relations and other
business relations of the Company as they may involve the members of the KPC
Affiliated Group, Related Entities and their respective officers and
directors, and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the Company and
its officers, Directors and Shareholders in connection therewith. The
provisions of this Article XXXIV are in addition to, and not in limitation
of, the provisions of the Statute and the other provisions of the Articles.
Any contract or business relation which does not comply with the procedures
set forth in this Article XXXIV shall not by reason thereof be deemed void or
voidable or be deemed to result in any breach of any fiduciary duty or duty
of loyalty or failure to act in good faith or in the interests of the Company
or to be the derivation of any improper personal benefit, but shall be
governed by the provisions of the Articles, the Memorandum, the Statute
and other applicable law.   34.2 No contract, agreement, arrangement or
transaction between the Company and a member of the KPC Affiliated Group or
between the Company and one or more of the Directors or officers of the
Company, a member of the KPC Affiliated Group or any Related Entity or
between the Company and any Related Entity shall be void or voidable solely
for the reason that a member of the KPC Affiliated Group, any Related Entity
or any one or more of the officers or Directors of the Company, a member of
the KPC Affiliated Group or any Related Entity are parties thereto, or solely
because any such Directors or officers are present at or participate in the
meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the
contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction, or solely because his or
their votes are counted for such purpose, and such member of the KPC
Affiliated Group, any Related Entity and such Directors and officers
shall not be liable to the Company or its Shareholders by reason of the
entering into, performance or consummation of any such contract, agreement,
arrangement or transaction, except in the case of wilful default or fraud on
the part of such directors or officers, if:   (a) the material facts as to
the contract, agreement, arrangement or  transaction are disclosed or are
known to the Board of Directors or the  committee thereof that authorizes the
contract, agreement, arrangement or  transaction, and the Board of Directors
or such committee in good faith  authorizes the contract, agreement,
arrangement or transaction by the  affirmative vote of a majority of the
disinterested Directors, even though  the disinterested Directors be less
than a quorum; or   (b) the material facts as to the contract, agreement,
arrangement or  transaction are disclosed or are known to the holders of the
Ordinary  Shares entitled to vote thereon, and the contract, agreement,
arrangement  or transaction is specifically approved by vote of the holders
of a  majority of the voting power of the Ordinary Shares then outstanding
not  owned by the members of the KPC Affiliated Group or a Related Entity,
as  the case may be.   28    34.3 Directors of the Company who are also
directors or officers of a member of the KPC Affiliated Group or any Related
Entity may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of
the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract,
agreement, arrangement or transaction. Ordinary Shares owned by the members
of the KPC Affiliated Group and any Related Entities may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of Shareholders which
authorizes the contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction.   34.4 Any
person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares
will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of
this Article XXXIV.   34.5 For purposes of this Article XXXIV, the members

in Article XXXIII.   34.6 For purposes of this Article XXXIV, any contract,
agreement, arrangement or transaction with any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust, association or other entity
which would be considered a "subsidiary" of the Company within the meaning of
Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, shall be deemed to
be a contract, agreement, arrangement or transaction with the Company.  
34.7 The provisions of Section 34, including, without limitation,
the provisions of this Section 34.7, may only be altered or amended by a
Special Resolution passed at a meeting of the Company at which a Special
Quorum of Shareholders is present.   XXXV. KPC PROVISIONS   35.1 (a) For
so long as members of the KPC Affiliated Group own, in the aggregate, at
least four percent (4%), (i) of the voting power of Outstanding Voting Stock,
or (ii) of all the outstanding Ordinary Shares, the Nominating and Governance
Committee and the Board of Directors shall, subject to Section 35.3, the next
succeeding sentence of this Section 35.1(a) and the Statute, cause any slate
of Directors presented to the Shareholders for election to the Board
of Directors to consist of such nominees that, if elected, would result in a
Board of Directors that includes individuals designated by SFIC Holdings (the
"KPC Designees") such that, after giving effect to the election of such KPC
Designees to the Board of Directors, the number of KPC Designees then serving
as Directors shall equal the product (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
of (i) the total number of Directors constituting the whole Board of
Directors, multiplied by (ii) the KPC Ownership Percentage on the date such
slate of Directors is presented to the Shareholders. As used herein, the "KPC
Ownership Percentage" means, (i) as of any date on and after the date any
member of the KPC Affiliated Group has sold or otherwise disposed of any
Outstanding Voting Stock (the "Disposition Date"), the percentage of the
voting power of all Outstanding Voting Stock represented by shares of
Outstanding Voting Stock which are owned by members of the KPC Affiliated
Group on such date, which shares were also owned on the date of the Merger
Agreement by members of the KPC Affiliated Group, and (ii) as of any date
prior to the Disposition Date, the percentage of the voting power of all
Outstanding Voting Stock immediately following the Effective Time represented
by shares of Outstanding Voting Stock which are owned by members of the KPC
Affiliated Group on such date, which shares were also   29   owned
immediately following the Effective Time by members of the KPC
Affiliated Group. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,
it is understood and agreed that as long as SFIC Holdings has the right to
designate a director pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 35.1(a),
the number of KPC Designees entitled to be nominated for election to the
Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 35.1(a)
shall be not less than (i) three until such time as the KPC Ownership
Percentage is reduced to less than 12.5% and equal to or greater than 7.5%,
at which time the number of KPC Designees entitled to be so nominated shall
be reduced from three to two, (ii) two until such time as the KPC Ownership
Percentage is reduced to less than 7.5% and equal to or greater than 4%, at
which time the number of KPC Designees entitled to be so nominated shall be
reduced from two to one, and (iii) one until such time as the KPC Ownership
Percentage is reduced to less than 4%, at which time no KPC Designees shall
be entitled to be so nominated.   (b) As long as SFIC Holdings has the
right, pursuant to Section 35.1, to designate more than one Director, to the
extent possible, each KPC Designee shall be elected or designated to
different classes.   35.2 (a) As long as SFIC Holdings has the right to
designate a Director pursuant to the first sentence of Section 35.1(a),
subject to Section 35.1, Section 35.2(b) and Section 35.3, if a KPC Designee
ceases to serve as a Director for any reason, the Nominating and Governance
Committee and the Board of Directors shall exercise all authority under
applicable law to cause the vacancy created by such Director ceasing to serve
to be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors
then in office, through the appointment of another KPC Designee.   (b) In
the event that, on the date of any election of Directors by the Shareholders,
(A)(i) the KPC Ownership Percentage is less than 12.5% and equal to or
greater than 7.5%, and (ii) the aggregate number of KPC Designees on
the Board on such date (immediately prior to such election) exceeds two, then
the number of KPC Designees on the Board exceeding two shall be deemed to
have resigned from the Board of Directors on such date (immediately prior to
such election) such that the remaining number of KPC Designees is two and
(B)(i) the KPC Ownership Percentage is less than 7.5%, and (ii) the aggregate
number of KPC Designees on the Board on such date (immediately prior to such
election) exceeds one, then the number of KPC Designees on the Board
exceeding one shall be deemed to have resigned from the Board of Directors on
such date (immediately prior to such election) such that the remaining number
of KPC Designee(s) is one. Unless otherwise decided among the KPC Designees
and SFIC Holdings, the KPC Designee(s) who shall resign pursuant to this
Section 35.2(b) shall be the KPC Designees selected by the Nominating and
Governance Committee.   35.3 Each KPC Designee shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company.   35.4 For the purposes of this Article XXXV, the
members of the KPC Affiliated Group shall have the meaning set forth in
Article XXXIII.   35.5 The provisions of Section 35, including, without
limitation, the provisions of this Section 35.5, may only be altered or
amended by a Special Resolution passed at a meeting of the Company at which a
Special Quorum of Shareholders is present.   30    XXXVI. AMENDMENTS OF
ARTICLES   36.1 Subject to the Statute and except as otherwise provided in
the Articles, the Company may at any time and from time to time by
Special Resolution alter or amend the Articles in whole or in part.

Freeway Dallas, TX 75240-2648  Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have been
advised that as of the date of this letter I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Global Marine Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Global"), as the
term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). I have been
further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of August 31, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement") among Santa Fe
International Corporation, a company organized under the laws of the Cayman
Islands ("Santa Fe"), Silver Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly

defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me.   I represent, warrant and
covenant to Santa Fe that in the event I receive any Santa Fe Ordinary Shares
as a result of the Merger:   (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or

registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is 
made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 of the 
Rules and    Regulations, or (iii) such sale, transfer or other disposition
is otherwise  exempt from registration under the Act.   (d) I understand
that Santa Fe is under no obligation to register such  sale, transfer or
other disposition by me or on my behalf under the  Securities Act or take any
other action necessary in order to make  compliance with an exemption from
such registration available.   (e) I also understand that stop transfer
instructions will be given to  Santa Fe\'s transfer agents with respect to
the Santa Fe Ordinary Shares and  that there will be placed on the
certificate for the Santa Fe Ordinary  Shares issued to me in connection with
the Merger, or any substitutions  therefor, a legend substantially in the
form set forth below:   "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE
BEEN ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF  1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED  EXCEPT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SAID RULE 145 OR 
PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SAID ACT OR AN EXEMPTION  FROM
SUCH REGISTRATION."   It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth
in paragraph (e)  above shall be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such  legend (i) prior to the first anniversary of the
Merger if (x) I am not at  such time an affiliate of Santa Fe and (y) the
undersigned shall have  delivered to Santa Fe a copy of a letter from the
staff of the Commission  or an opinion of counsel, in each case reasonably
satisfactory to Santa Fe  in form and substance, to the effect that such
legend is no longer required  for purposes of the Securities Act, or (ii)
thereafter at the request of  the undersigned.   (f) I also understand that
unless the transfer by me of my Santa Fe  Ordinary Shares has been registered
under the Securities Act or is a sale  made in conformity with the provisions
of Rule 145 of the Rules and  Regulations, Santa Fe reserves the right to put
the following legend on the  certificates issued to my transferee:   "THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED  UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO  RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED  UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN  ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A
VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION  WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN
THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED  EXCEPT IN   2    ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION
FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS  OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."   It is
understood and agreed that the legend set forth in paragraph (f)  above shall
be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such  legend if
such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.   Execution
of this letter should not be construed as an admission, stipulation or
acknowledgment by me that I am an "affiliate" of Santa Fe as described in the
first paragraph hereof or considered as a waiver of any rights that I may
have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date
of this letter.   Very truly yours,
