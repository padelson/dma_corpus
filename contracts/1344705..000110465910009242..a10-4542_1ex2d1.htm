WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
deem it advisable to consummate, and have approved, the transaction provided
for herein pursuant to which Sub will merge with and into the Company and the
Company will become an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and

WHEREAS to effect such transaction, the respective Boards of Directors of
Parent, Sub and the Company have approved the merger of the Company and
Sub (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, whereby the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
not owned directly or through a Subsidiary by the Company will be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Amount (as defined in Section 1.7(a)), in
cash, without interest thereon;

  



  

WHEREAS Brookfield US is lender to the Company under that certain Amended and
Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated November 8, 2007 (as amended to
date, the " _Credit Agreement_ "), and has entered into a Fourth Amendment to
the Credit Agreement concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
pursuant to which, among other matters, Brookfield US has consented to the
Merger in its capacity as lender; and

  



  

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,

# **ARTICLE I. 
  
  _THE MERGER_**

  

# ** **

  

 **Section 1.1** ** ****_The Merger_** **.  **Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and the articles of merger in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), and in
accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (Sub and the Company are sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ") at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.2). At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue under
its present name as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in
accordance with the MGCL.

  



  

 **Section 1.2** ** ****_Effective Time of the Merger_** **. **Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement, the Constituent Corporations shall cause
the Articles of Merger to be duly prepared and executed and filed with the
State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "
_Department_ "), as provided in Section 3-107 of the MGCL and consistent with
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date (as defined in
Section 1.3). The Merger shall become effective upon the acceptance of the
Articles of Merger for record by the Department, unless a later time is
specified in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

 **Section 1.3** ** ****_Closing_** **.  **The closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to
be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business
Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions set forth in
_Article V _(the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP,
787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. " _Business Day_ " means a day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which banks are
not required to be open or are authorized to close in New York, New York.

  



  

 **Section 1.4** ** ****_Effects of the Merger_** **.  **The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 3-114 of the MGCL.

  



  

 **Section 1.5** ** ****_Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_**.

  



  

### (a) At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, the charter of the
Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety to be
substantially identical to the charter of Sub, as in effect on the date
hereof, except that the applicable article of such charter will read as
follows: "The name of the Corporation shall be "Crystal River Capital, Inc."

  

### 

  

### (b) Immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
take such steps as are necessary to amend and restate in their entirety the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in order that they will be substantially
identical to the bylaws of Sub as in effect on the date hereof (it being
understood that such bylaws shall include provisions with respect to the
indemnification of directors and officers as contemplated by the first
sentence of Section 4.5).

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 1.6** ** ****_Directors and Officers_** **.  **The directors and
officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified or appointed, as the case may be.

  



  

 **Section 1.7** ** ****_Conversion of Shares_**.

  



  

### (a) Each share of the Company Common Stock (a " _Share_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares
held by Parent, Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or by the
Company (held in treasury) or ** ** any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company) shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive the Cash Amount, payable to the holder of the certificate formerly
representing such Share, without interest thereon, upon the surrender thereof
in accordance herewith and with the Articles of Merger at any time after the
Effective Time. As used in this Agreement, the " _Cash Amount_ " means $0.60.

  

### 

  

### (b) Each Share held by the Company (held in treasury) or **** any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company, if any, shall, at the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Sub or the holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished and
cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (c) No Share held by Parent, Sub or **** any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or Sub, if any, shall be converted into cash, securities or other
property as a result of the Merger; all such Shares outstanding immediately
preceding the Effective Time shall remain outstanding immediately following
the Effective Time as shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
without any change or modification to any right, preference, privilege or
voting power of any such shares or the holders thereof.

  

### 

  

 **Section 1.8** ** ****_Conversion of Sub s Capital Stock_** **. **Each
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent or Sub, be converted into and become one share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 **Section 1.9** ** ****_Stock Options and Restricted Stock_**.

  



  

### (a) At the Effective Time, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to take all necessary action, including all reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of the individual holders of options, restricted stock units and
deferred stock units, if necessary, to (i) terminate the Companys 2005 Long-
Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _Company Stock Plan_ ") and (ii) to
cancel, at the Effective Time, each option to acquire the Company Common
Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") outstanding and unexercised as of
such date, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, under the
Company Stock Plan.  Each holder of a Company Stock Option outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable and whether or not vested, shall be entitled to receive from the

  



        
   

  



  

### Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, in
exchange for the cancellation of the Company Stock Option, a lump sum cash
payment, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the excess, if any, of
(x) the product of the Cash Amount multiplied by the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option over (y) the
aggregate exercise price for such Company Stock Option.  The Company shall
take all action necessary (i) to approve the disposition of the Company Stock
Options in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
the extent necessary to exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of the
Exchange Act (as defined in Section 2.3) and (ii) to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 1.9(a).

  

### 

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted or otherwise unvested Share,
stock unit or Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as provided in the Company Stock Plan, automatically
become fully vested and eligible for payment as set forth in Section 1.10 to
the extent not otherwise cancelled and paid for pursuant to Section 1.9(a)
(in the case of Company Stock Options).

  

### 

  

 **Section 1.10** ** ****_Payment for Shares_**.

  



  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Sub to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") in connection with the Merger (which bank or trust company
shall agree in writing to comply with the provisions of this Section 1.10
applicable to it).  At the Closing, the Surviving Corporation (with funds
obtained from Parent) or Parent shall deposit in trust (which trust shall be
for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company) with the Paying Agent an
amount (the " _Payment Fund_ ") in immediately available funds equal to the
sum of (x) the product of (i) the sum of (A) the aggregate number of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held
by any Subsidiary of the Company) plus (B) the aggregate number of the
Companys restricted or deferred stock units outstanding and (ii) the Cash
Amount and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) the product of the Cash
Amount multiplied by the aggregate number of Shares underlying Company Stock
Options that entitle the holders thereof to purchase such Shares at a price
per share less than the Cash Amount (to the extent that such Company Stock
Options have not been cancelled and paid for pursuant to Section 1.9(a)) over
(ii) the aggregate exercise price for such Company Stock Options. The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation (so long as such directions do not impair the rights of the
holders of Shares or the ability of the Paying Agent to make timely payments
as required hereby), in direct obligations of the United States of America or
any state thereof, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or any such state is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, commercial paper either rated of the
highest quality by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation or certificates of deposit issued by, or other deposit accounts
of, a commercial bank having at least $1,000,000,000 in capital and surplus,
in each case with a maturity of three months or less. Any earnings
with respect thereto shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation as and
when requested by the Surviving Corporation.  If at any time the amount of
the Payment Fund shall be less than the amount required to make the payments
contemplated by Section 1.7, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit
in trust with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to make such payments.  The
Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the cash
payments referred to in Section 1.7 out of the Payment Fund.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to
each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced
ownership of a Share or Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") a form letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly
executed, and any other required documents, the holder of such Certificate
shall receive as promptly as practicable in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate and the Cash Amount, and such Certificate shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person
(as defined in Section 2.1(d)) other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered and exchanged in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.10, each Certificate (other than any
Certificates representing Shares held by Parent, Sub or any other wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or Sub, or any Subsidiary of the Company) shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration set
forth in Section 1.7 without any interest thereon, and until such surrender
and exchange no cash shall be delivered to the holder of such outstanding
Certificate in respect thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including the remaining portion of the Payment
Fund and any interest received with respect thereto) that are held by the
Paying Agent that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws)
for distribution of the consideration provided in Section 1.7, upon due
surrender of their Certificates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to a
holder of a Certificate for the consideration provided in Section 1.7
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law.

  

### 

  

### (e) After the Effective Time there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the consideration provided in Section 1.7 in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.10.

  



     

      
 

  



  

### (f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such
other conditions as the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation may
impose, the Surviving Corporation shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Cash Amount deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance herewith. When authorizing such payment of the
Cash Amount in exchange therefor, the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to give the Surviving Corporation a bond in
such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

### 

  

### (g) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Cash Amount
at any time.

  

### 

  

### (h) Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the merger consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under (i) the Code (as
defined in Section 4.14(a)) or (ii) any applicable, state, local or foreign
Tax (as defined in Section 4.14(a)) laws. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be timely paid to the
appropriate taxing authority and shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or

under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company.  Since the Company was
subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has made any loans to any executive officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information relating
to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known on a
timely basis to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities; and

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### the Company believes that such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

transaction, contract or arrangement with any Affiliate (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Affiliates) or any
officer, director or employee of the Company or a Subsidiary or other
Affiliate of the Company or any of their respective relatives (each, a "
_Related Person_ ") in respect of which either the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has or may in the future have continuing obligations following
the Effective Time. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries has any
continuing obligations in respect of any Contract pursuant to which
any assets or business has been acquired from any Related Person. Except as
specifically set forth in _Schedule 2.23_ of the Company Letter or with
respect to any agreements or arrangements with Parent or any of its
Affiliates, each material transaction, contract and arrangement with a
Related Person is terminable, without penalty or other termination fee or
charge, by the Company or a Subsidiary party thereto on no more than 30 days
notice.

  



  

 **Section 2.24** ** ****_Insurance_** **.  ** _Schedule 2.24_ of the
Company Letter lists all insurance policies maintained by the Company (the "
_Company Insurance Policies_ "). None of the Company or its Subsidiaries is
in any material default with respect to its obligations under any Company
Insurance Policy, and each such insurance policy is in full force and effect,
is in such amounts and against such losses and risks as are consistent with
industry practice for companies engaged in businesses similar to those of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and
availability of such insurance) and, in the reasonable judgment of senior
management of the Company, are adequate to protect the properties
and businesses of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and all premiums
due thereunder have been paid. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has
been refused any insurance with respect to its business, properties or
assets, nor has its coverage been limited, by any insurance carrier to which
it has applied for any such insurance with which it has carried insurance
since January 1, 2008. _Schedule 2.24_ of the Company Letter lists all
claims of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries related to the businesses,
assets or properties of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
which are currently pending or which have been made with an insurance carrier
since January 1, 2008.  From January 1, 2008 to the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of cancellation of
any Company Insurance Policy.

Date will be, required to be registered as an investment company under the

date, the Cash Amount to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock

Company) in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. A copy of the written opinion of the Company Financial Advisor has

the Company for its existing insurance as of the date hereof and (ii)
$4,000,000, in either case for a one-time premium payment for such six-year

premium payment for such six-year period is insufficient for such coverage,
the Surviving Corporation shall spend up to that amount to purchase such
lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount.

  

### 

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 4.5 are intended to be for the benefit

officer of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, and such directors or
officers heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on all

accountants, agents or other advisors or representatives may furnish
nonpublic information concerning the Company to any Person making a Takeover
Proposal or reasonably likely to make a Takeover Proposal and

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### its employees, agents and representatives so long as such information is
furnished pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (no less restrictive to the
Person making such Takeover Proposal or reasonably likely to make a Takeover
Proposal than the confidentiality agreement dated December 3, 2009, between
Parent and the Company Financial Advisor on behalf of the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ")).  For all purposes of this Agreement, "
_Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, other than a
proposal by Parent or Sub, for a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or other similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any inquiry, proposal or offer (including, without
limitation, any proposal or offer to stockholders of the Company), other than
a proposal or offer by Parent or Sub, to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, a significant equity interest in, a significant amount of any
voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, any inquiries, offers or proposals relating to the CMBS Sales
or the Collateral Management Assignment shall not constitute Takeover
Proposals.

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the Company Recommendation or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company and/or
the Special Committee may (A) approve or recommend a Superior Proposal (an "
_Alternative Recommendation_ ") and/or (B) withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent (a " _Change of Recommendation_
"), in each case as provided in Section 4.10(f). For all purposes of this
Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Takeover
Proposal made by a third party to acquire the Company pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer, a merger, consolidation or business combination, a share
exchange, a sale of all or substantially all its assets or otherwise (x) on
terms which a majority of the disinterested **** members of the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in their good faith judgment, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor, to be more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all
relevant factors (including the payment of Expenses (as defined in Section
4.11(c)) and any additional expenses of the Company if the Takeover Proposal
is in the form of a sale of all or substantially all its assets), (y) which
is reasonably likely to be consummated (taking into account, among other
things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal,
including any conditions, and the identity of the offeror) and (z) for which
financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or which, in the
good faith judgment of a majority of such disinterested members (based on the
advice of independent financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being
financed by such third party.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company, promptly (and in any event within two Business Days of
the date of receipt thereof), shall advise Parent orally and in writing of
any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the
Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and the material terms and conditions
(including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such Takeover Proposal
or inquiry. Parent and Sub hereby waive any 

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### applicable confidentiality provisions to the extent necessary to allow
the Company to explain the terms of this transaction to each Person, if any,
making a Takeover Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (d) If, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company receives
a Takeover Proposal which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which a
majority of the disinterested members of the Companys Board of Directors in
good faith concludes proposes consideration that is more favorable to the
Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and which could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal in
all other respects, it shall promptly, but in any event within two Business
Days of the Companys Board of Directors determining that such Takeover
Proposal satisfies either clause (i) or clause (ii), provide to Parent
written notice that shall state expressly (A) that it has received a Takeover
Proposal which constitutes a Superior Proposal or which could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B) the identity of the party
making such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ").

  

### 

  

### (e) For a period of not less than five Business Days after receipt by
Parent from the Company of each Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall,
if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to permit Parent
to improve the terms and conditions of this Agreement (from the viewpoint of
the Company and its stockholders) so that the Company would be able to
proceed with the Company Recommendation to its stockholders without making an
Alternative Recommendation or a Change of Recommendation.

  

### 

  

### (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Company
Stockholders Meeting has not occurred and after compliance by the Company
with Section 4.10(e), the Board of Directors of the Company and/or the
Special Committee may in response to (i) the receipt of a Superior Proposal
that has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal,
make an Alternative Recommendation, or (ii) a material development or change
in circumstances that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement and
that was not reasonably expected by the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Special Committee to so occur or arise (a " _Change in Circumstances_ "),
effect a Change of Recommendation, in each case if a majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded
in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that,
in light of such Superior Proposal or Change in Circumstances, the failure of
the Board of Directors to make an Alternative Recommendation or effect a
Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
to its stockholders under applicable Law.

contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees and expenses of counsel,

of the Company, the Special Committee) shall use all reasonable efforts to
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the

 **Section 6.4** ** _Complete Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.
 **This Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Company Letter constitute
the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings of the parties
in connection therewith. Except as specified in Section 4.5 (Indemnification;
Directors and Officers Insurance), this Agreement is not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the Company, Parent and Sub any rights or remedies
hereunder, other than the provisions of Article I concerning the payment of
the Merger Consideration, which shall inure to the benefit of the Companys
stockholders but, prior to the Effective Time, may be enforced solely by the
Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, acting on their behalf.

  



  

 **Section 6.5** ** _GOVERNING LAW; VENUE_. **EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
MGCL GOVERNS THE EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. PARENT, SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND
THE FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO ENFORCE ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR TO DETERMINE THE RIGHTS OF ANY PARTY HERETO.

  



  

 **Section 6.6** ** _No Assignment_. **Neither this Agreement nor any
rights or obligations under it are assignable by any party without the
written consent of the other parties.

  



  

 **Section 6.7** ** _Headings_. **The descriptive headings of the
articles, sections and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience only
and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 6.8** ** _Counterparts_. **This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts. All
such counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each party
and delivered to the other party.

  



  

 **Section 6.9** ** _Interpretation_. **The word " _including_ ", when
used herein, shall be deemed to mean " _including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing_ ". When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article, a Section or an Exhibit, such reference shall be to an article
of this Agreement, a section of this Agreement or an Exhibit attached to this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated.

  



  

 **Section 6.10** ** _Remedies; Waiver_. **All rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.  No failure on the part of any party to
exercise or delay in exercising any right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any further or
other exercise of such or any other right. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that remedies
at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants
contained in this Agreement (including a failure to consummate the Merger
when obligated pursuant to this Agreement.) The Company, Parent and Sub
shall be entitled to equitable relief, including the remedy of specific
performance, with respect to any breach or

  



        
   

  



  

attempted breach of such covenants by any other party, and, in connection
therewith, the parties hereby waive any requirement for the posting of a
bond.

  



  

 **Section 6.11** ** _Confidentiality_. **The parties agree that any
information heretofore or hereafter provided by the Company to Parent or Sub
shall, until the Effective Date, be subject to the confidentiality provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, and until the Effective Date Parent and Sub
agree to keep such information confidential to the extent required by
such confidentiality provisions, without giving effect to the termination
provisions of such agreement.

  



  

 **Section 6.12** ** _Severability_. **Any invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render illegal or unenforceable the remaining
provisions hereof in such jurisdiction and shall not invalidate or render
illegal or unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. The
Company and the Parent and Sub shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to
replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable provision, the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

  



  

 **Section 6.13** ** _Amendment; Waiver_. **This Agreement may be amended
only by agreement in writing of all parties. No waiver of any provision nor
consent to any exception to the terms of this Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only to the
specific purpose, extent and instance so provided.

  



  

 **Section 6.14** ** _Subsidiary Actions_**. Parent shall cause Sub to take
all actions required of Sub under this Agreement.

  



  

 _[Remainder of this Page Intentionally Left Blank]_

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized all as of
the date first written above.
