$417,500,000 plus or minus the Working Capital calculated on the unaudited
balance sheet of NCNG for the end of the most recent month immediately
preceding the Closing for which such data is reasonably available (the
"Estimated Purchase Price"). The "Working Capital" (which may be a positive
or negative number) will be equal to the amount of the difference between the
book value of current assets and the book value of current liabilities on the
date the Working Capital is determined (as determined in accordance with
GAAP), provided, however, that for the purposes of this definition, (i)
current assets as of any date shall not include any Tax refund, Tax credit or
other Tax asset and (ii) current liabilities as of any date shall not include
any liability for Taxes or notes payable to Affiliates of NCNG. As an example
only, the computation of the Working Capital as of July 31, 2002 is set forth
on Schedule 2.2 exhibiting an amount of Working Capital as ($15,463,000).  
(b) Adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price   (i) As promptly as
practical, but in no event more than 60  days after the Closing, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a  draft of a schedule of the Working Capital
of NCNG (in the format  consistent with Schedule 2.2) as part of the
commencement of business  on the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Working
Capital Schedule"), which  shall reflect the value of the Working Capital as
of such date,  together with a draft of their report stating, without
qualification,  that the Preliminary Working Capital Schedule has been
prepared in  conformity with GAAP.   (ii) Seller may review the manner in
which Buyer plans to  prepare the Preliminary Working Capital Schedule,
including, but not  limited to, the nature and extent of the procedures to be
applied in  preparing the schedule, Seller shall be entitled to observe the
taking  of the physical inventory, if any.   (iii) During the 15 days
following the receipt by Seller of  the draft of the Preliminary Working
Capital Schedule and the report of  Buyer with respect thereto, Seller shall
be permitted to review the  working papers of Buyer relating to the draft of
the Preliminary  Working Capital Schedule and shall have such access to
Buyer\'s  personnel as may be reasonably necessary to permit them to review
in  detail the manner in which the draft was prepared. Buyer shall 
cooperate with Seller in facilitating such review. Seller shall give  any
comments or objections they have with respect or objections they  
-8-     have with respect to the draft of the Preliminary Working
Capital  Schedule to Buyer. Such comments or objections, insofar as they
relate  to the valuation of any assets or liabilities, shall be resolved by 
Buyer, and Buyer shall prepare a final schedule of Working Capital (the 
"Final Working Capital Schedule") which shall reflect such resolution,  and
deliver it to Seller pursuant to the provisions of the next  paragraph.  
(iv) Within 15 days after the expiration of the 15 day period  set forth in
Section 2.2(b)(iii), Buyer shall deliver to Seller the  Final Working Capital
Schedule accompanied by a definitive report of  Buyer with respect thereto.
Within 15 Business Days after receipt of  such schedule and report, Seller
shall deliver a letter to Buyer  stating whether Seller concurs with such
report and its exceptions  thereto, if any, together with the reasons
therefor. If Seller fails to  deliver to Buyer a letter within such period,
Seller shall be deemed to  have accepted the Final Working Capital Schedule.
If the objections  raised in a timely submitted letter from Seller cannot be
resolved  between Buyer and Seller within five Business Days after delivery
of  such letter by Seller, the question or questions in dispute shall then 
be promptly submitted to any "big four" accounting firm (other than 
Seller\'s auditors and Buyer\'s auditors), or if such accounting firm  cannot
or refuses to serve in such capacity, a mutually acceptable firm  of
independent public accountants of recognized standing, the decision  of which
as to such question or questions in dispute shall be final and  binding upon
Buyer and Seller. The accounting firm shall be instructed  to resolve the
question or questions in dispute within 20 days of  submission.   (v) If
the Final Working Capital Schedule, after the  resolution of all disputes,
indicates that the amount of Working  Capital of NCNG used to determine the
Estimated Purchase Price was less  than the amount of Working Capital of NCNG
reflected in the Final  Working Capital Schedule, Buyer shall promptly pay to
Seller, in  immediately available funds the amount of the difference. If the
Final  Working Capital Schedule, after the resolution of all disputes, 
indicates that the amount of Working Capital Schedule, after the  resolution
of all disputes, indicates that the amount of Working  Capital of NCNG used
to determine the Estimated Purchase Price exceeded  the amount of Working
Capital of NCNG reflected in the Final Working  Capital Schedule, Seller
shall promptly pay to Buyer, in immediately  available funds the amount of
such excess.   (vi) The fees of any independent accounting firm appointed 
pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iv) shall be borne equally by Seller and 
Buyer.   2.3. Purchase Price for the ENCNG Shares and the ENCNG Rights
and Obligations.   (a) The Purchase Price for the ENCNG Shares and the
ENCNG Rights and Obligations will be $7,500,000, and will be payable in full
at Closing.   (b) If, on the Closing Date, (i) Seller has not obtained from
APEC a waiver of APEC\'s right of first refusal as set forth in Section 7 of
the ENCNG Shareholders\' Agreement, or (ii) APEC has not consented to the
assignment of the COandM; Agreement from CPandL; to either NCNG, Buyer, or an
Affiliate of Buyer, or (iii) Buyer shall not have received an exemption
from   -9-   the provisions of PUHCA (except for Section 9(a)(2)
thereof), then the ENCNG Shares and the ENCNG Rights and Obligations shall
not be deemed to be a part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Buyer shall not be required to pay the Purchase Price for the ENCNG
Shares and the ENCNG Rights and Obligations.   2.4. Deliveries at Closing.
At the Closing, in addition to the deliveries required to be made at or prior
to the Closing pursuant to Article VII hereof, (i) Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer (A) all of its certificates representing the NCNG Shares and all of
its certificates representing the ENCNG Shares sold by Seller to Buyer duly
endorsed for transfer or accompanied by a duly executed stock power, (B) the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and (C) the Transition Services
Agreement, and (ii) the Buyer shall deliver to Seller (A) the Estimated
Purchase Price and the Purchase Price for the ENCNG Shares and the ENCNG
Rights and Obligations, if any, in immediately available funds by
wire transfer to an account specified by Seller, (B) the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, and (C) the Transition Services Agreement.   ARTICLE

Subsidiary, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other

likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on NCNG and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No event has occurred that
would, with the passage of time or compliance with any applicable notice
requirements or both, constitute a material default by NCNG or the Subsidiary
or, to the Knowledge of NCNG, any other party under any of the Contracts and,
to the Knowledge of NCNG, no party to any of the Contracts intends or has a
reasonable basis upon which to cancel or terminate or exercise any option

Knowledge of NCNG, threatened or contemplated, that, in the reasonable
judgment of Seller, if adversely determined, would have a Material Adverse
Effect on (i) NCNG and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) ENCNG, or
(iii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Schedule 4.11 contains all pending, or, to the Knowledge of NCNG,
threatened or contemplated (i) charges and claims filed by employees of NCNG
with the Equal Employment Commission and/or the applicable state deferral
agency, (ii) complaints and/or grievances filed or made by employees of NCNG

losses, and on such terms and conditions as are consistent with industry
practice in the business of NCNG and the Subsidiaries.   4.13. Employee

letter issued by the IRS.   (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.13
attached hereto, (i) each Employee Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension

assets or provided any material services to any employee of NCNG, the

Contracts do not include any obligation or commitment between NCNG or the

Adverse Effect on NCNG and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole:   (a) NCNG
and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.
Except for matters that have been fully resolved, neither NCNG nor any
Subsidiary, including any employee or agent thereof, has received any written
communication from any person or Governmental Authority that alleges that it
is not in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws.   (b) NCNG and each
of the Subsidiaries have obtained all environmental, health and safety
permits and governmental authorizations (collectively, the "Environmental
Permits") necessary for the construction of their facilities or the conduct
of their operations, and all such permits are in good standing or, where

approval, and NCNG and each Subsidiary is in material compliance with all
terms and conditions of the Environmental Permits. All pending applications
for Environmental Permits or modifications or other actions regarding those
Environmental Permits, including any pending enforcement matters to the
Knowledge of NCNG, are listed on Schedule 4.18.   (c) To the Knowledge of
NCNG, no Releases of any Hazardous Material has occurred on any of the
properties owned, leased or occupied by NCNG or any Subsidiary, which
requires investigation, assessment, monitoring, remediation or cleanup under
Environmental Laws. There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the

basis of any violation of any Environmental Law.   (d) Seller agrees to
accept complete responsibility for performing all of NCNG\'s remediation
obligations to conduct testing and clean-up at the Manufactured Gas
Facilities, including both the cost of such testing and clean-up, as well as
the implementation of any affirmative remediation obligations that NCNG has
related to the Manufactured Gas Facilities (the "NCNG MGP Remediation
Obligations"). In order that Seller be able to implement its obligations
regarding the Manufactured Gas Facilities, Seller will cause NCNG to transfer
to a Person other than an Affiliate of NCNG all right, title and interest
that NCNG has in all real property located at the Manufactured Gas Facilities
in New Bern and Kinston, such transfer to be performed as described in

other, to be taken by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated

satisfactory in form and substance to the Buyer and the Buyer\'s counsel;  
(l) the consents, authorizations, orders, permits and approvals described in

Person that would be an Affiliate of NCNG following the Closing;   (n)
prior to the Closing Date, Seller will cause NCNG to transfer any ownership

Person other than a Person that would be an Affiliate of NCNG following the
Closing; and   (o) there shall not exist any Contract preventing or
restricting NCNG or any Subsidiary from carrying on any business in any

representations and warranties of the Buyer contained in Article V shall be

COVENANTS   8.1. Access to Books and Records. At its expense, Seller and
its Affiliates and authorized agents, officers and representatives shall
have reasonable access after the Closing Date to the properties, books,
records, contracts, information and documents of NCNG and each of the
Subsidiaries, and, if Buyer is the owner of the ENCNG Shares, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for Seller such similar reasonable
access as regards ENCNG, for any reasonable business purpose, including, but
not limited to, matters relating to Taxes; provided, however, that such
access by Seller (a) shall be conducted during the normal business hours of
NCNG, the Subsidiaries and ENCNG, and (b) shall not unreasonably interfere
with the operations and activities of NCNG, any of the Subsidiaries, or
ENCNG. The Buyer and NCNG shall cooperate, and NCNG shall cause each of the
Subsidiaries to cooperate, and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause ENCNG to cooperate, in all reasonable respects with
Seller\'s review of such information, including, without limitation,
retaining all such information until Seller has notified the Buyer in writing
that all tax years (including any portion of a tax year) prior to and
including the Closing Date have been closed or for seven (7) years, whichever
is longer.   8.2. Tax Matters.   (a) Taxes and Tax Returns of NCNG and the
Subsidiaries in General.   (i) The income (including any deferred income
triggered into income by Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-13) and other Tax
items of NCNG and the Subsidiaries for periods ending on or before the
Closing Date shall be included in the consolidated Federal Income Tax Return
of the affiliated group, within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code,
of which Seller is a member. In addition, Seller shall be responsible for
preparing and filing the Tax Returns for State Income Taxes and for Other
Taxes of NCNG and the Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.2, and
specifically including all Taxes listed on Schedule 4.15, Seller shall be
responsible for and (to the extent not paid before Closing) shall indemnify
and hold Buyer, NCNG and the Subsidiaries harmless from, and shall be
entitled to, any reductions in Taxes or refunds (including interest) of, (i)
any Federal Income Taxes of NCNG or the Subsidiaries (including any amount
payable by reason of Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6) for taxable periods
ending on or before or, with respect to the consolidated Federal Income Tax
Return of Seller\'s affiliated group, including the Closing Date, and (ii)
any State Income Taxes and Other Taxes of NCNG or the Subsidiaries (including
any amount payable by reason of any applicable provision of State Income Tax
Law similar to Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6) for taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date. If Buyer, NCNG or any of the Subsidiaries
receives any such refund, Buyer shall promptly pay (or cause NCNG or such
Subsidiary to pay) the entire amount of the refund (including interest) to
Seller. Seller will allow Buyer an opportunity to review and comment upon
any Piped Natural Gas excise tax returns and all property tax returns
(including any amended returns) filed between the date of this Agreement and
Closing to the extent they relate to NCNG and the Subsidiaries. Except as may
be required by law, Seller will take no position prior to Closing
inconsistent with existing practice as of the date of this Agreement on all
Other Tax Returns that relate to NCNG and the Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on NCNG and the Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date, alone or in the aggregate, of more than $100,000.  
-30-     (ii) Buyer, NCNG and the Subsidiaries shall be responsible
for and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from all Taxes of NCNG and
the Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning on or after the Closing
Date and, with respect to prior taxable periods, for all Taxes resulting from
any action taken without Seller\'s written consent by Buyer, NCNG or the
Subsidiaries after the Closing (including, without limitation, actions taken
outside the ordinary course of business and occurring on the Closing Date).
Buyer, NCNG and the Subsidiaries shall be entitled to all refunds of such
Taxes (including interest).   (iii) If NCNG or any of the Subsidiaries is
required to file any Tax Return for State Income Taxes or for Other Taxes for
a taxable period covering days before and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause such Tax Return to be filed and shall be responsible for the payment of
any such Tax for such period. However, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, the amount by which such Tax attributable
to the period through the Closing Date exceeds the amount of such Tax paid
(including payments of estimated Tax) on or before the Closing Date. The
amount of such Tax attributable to the period through the Closing Date shall
be determined (i) as if that period were a separate taxable year (except for
any Other Taxes not based on income, sales, receipts, payments or
transactions, which Other Taxes shall be allocated ratably to each day in the
entire taxable period), and (ii) except as otherwise required by Law, by
using the Tax accounting methods and Tax elections used by NCNG or such
Subsidiary for the taxable period ended most recently before the Closing
Date. Seller shall compute the amount of the Tax attributable to the period
through the Closing Date and shall notify Buyer of such amount in writing no
later than 120 days after the Closing Date or, in the case of any State
Income Tax Return, 30 days after the due date (including valid extensions)
for the filing of the consolidated Federal Income Tax Return of Seller\'s
affiliated group for the period including the Closing Date. Within 45 days
after the date of such notification, Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall
pay to Seller, as appropriate, the difference between (i) the amount of Tax
determined by Seller as attributable to the portion of the period through the
Closing Date, and (ii) the amount of the Tax for the taxable period
paid (including payments of estimated Tax) on or before the Closing Date,
unless within 30 days after such date, Buyer notifies Seller in writing that
Buyer disagrees with the computation of any such amount. In that case, Seller
and Buyer shall proceed in good faith to determine the correct amount, and
Seller\'s payment to Buyer, or Buyer\'s payment to Seller, shall be due the
later of (i) the time specified in the immediately preceding sentence and
(ii) 10 days after Seller and Buyer agree to the amount payable or after
receipt of the written determination described below. If after 30 days Buyer
and Seller are unable to agree upon the amount of the difference in Tax owed,
then such objections shall be referred to a "Big 4" accounting firm mutually
agreeable to both Buyer and Seller (other than Seller\'s auditors and
Buyer\'s auditors) or if such accounting firm can not or refuses to serve in
such capacity, a mutually acceptable firm of independent public accountants
of recognized standing. Such accounting firm shall be instructed to deliver
to the Seller and the Buyer a written determination of the amount of the
difference in Tax owed within 20 days. Such determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto for all purposes. Seller and Buyer shall
share fees of the accounting firm equally.   (b) Section 338 Elections.  
(i) An election shall be made by Buyer and Seller under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code ("Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to all of NCNG and,  
-31-    to the extent permissible under applicable Treasury Regulations,
the Subsidiaries, unless Buyer (in good faith) notifies Seller on or before
the Closing Date that Buyer will not make such election because it would
result in a decrease in the aggregate adjusted federal income tax basis of
NCNG\'s assets. The parties thereafter shall cooperate to prepare and timely
file IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form). Seller shall prepare and file the
returns for, be responsible for the payment of, indemnify and hold Buyer,
NCNG and the Subsidiaries harmless from (and be entitled to any refund of)
any Federal Income Taxes and State Income Taxes with respect to the deemed
sale of assets resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election (and any
corresponding election under state Law). If a refund of any Tax described in
this paragraph is paid to any of the Buyer, NCNG, or any of the Subsidiaries,
Buyer shall promptly pay (or shall cause NCNG or the Subsidiaries to pay) the
amount of such refund to the Seller. The parties intend for each such Section
338(h)(10) Election to be effective, if possible, for state (as well as
federal) income Tax purposes, and they shall timely execute and file any
documents that may be required under any applicable Law for such election (or
any corresponding elections(s) under state Law) to be effective for State
Income Tax purposes.   (ii) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate as provided in
this Section 8.2(b)(ii) to determine (in accordance with all applicable
Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the Code) the deemed
sales prices of the assets of NCNG and each Subsidiary to which the election
applies. Buyer initially shall determine such deemed sales prices and shall
notify Seller in writing of the prices so determined ("Buyer\'s Deemed Sales
Price Notice") within 120 days after the Closing Date. Seller shall be deemed
to have accepted such determination unless, within 60 days after the date of
Buyer\'s Deemed Sales Price Notice, Seller notifies Buyer in writing of (i)
each proposed deemed sales price with which Seller disagrees, and (ii) for
each such price, the amount that Seller proposes as the deemed sales price.
If Seller provides such notice to Buyer, the parties shall proceed in good
faith to determine mutually the deemed sales prices in dispute. If after 30
days Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon the deemed sales price of the
assets of NCNG and each Subsidiary to which the Section 338(h)(10) Election
applies, then such objections shall be referred to a "Big 4" accounting firm
mutually agreeable to both Buyer and Seller (other than Seller\'s auditors
and Buyer\'s auditors) or if such accounting firm can not or refuses to serve
in such capacity, a mutually acceptable firm of independent public
accountants of recognized standing. Such accounting firm shall be instructed
to deliver to the Seller and the Buyer a written determination of the proper
allocation of such disputed items within 20 days. Such determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto for all purposes. Seller and
Buyer shall share fees of the accounting firm equally. Neither Buyer
nor Seller shall take, nor shall they permit any affiliated corporation
(including, without limitation, NCNG and the Subsidiaries) to take, any
position for income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with the deemed sales
prices as finally determined hereunder; provided, however, that (i) the
deemed purchase price of the assets may differ from the deemed sales price to
the extent necessary to reflect the inclusion in the total deemed purchase
price of Buyer\'s transaction costs not included in the total deemed sales
price and (ii) the amount realized upon the deemed sale of assets may differ
from the deemed sales price to reflect transaction costs that reduce the
amount realized for Federal Income Tax purposes.   (iii) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if Buyer makes or is deemed to have
made an election under Section 338 (without a Section 338(h)(10)  
-32-   Election being made) with respect to any of NCNG and the
Subsidiaries, Buyer shall prepare and file the returns for, be responsible
for the payment of, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from, and be entitled
to any refund of, any Taxes resulting from the election (and any
corresponding election under state Law).   (c) Cooperation Regarding NCNG
and the Subsidiaries.   (i) Buyer agrees to cooperate and to cause NCNG and
the Subsidiaries to cooperate with Seller to the extent reasonably required
after the Closing Date in connection with (i) the filing, amendment,
preparation and execution of all Tax Returns with respect to any taxable
period of any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing
Date, (ii) contests concerning the Tax due for any such period and (iii)
audits and other proceedings conducted by, with, or against any Governmental
Authority with respect to any such period. Within a reasonable time (but not
more than 10 days) after Buyer or any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries receives
official notice of any such contest, audit or other proceeding, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing of such contest, audit or other proceeding. In any
case where any of NCNG or the Subsidiaries is responsible under applicable
Law for the defense of such contest, audit or other proceeding, Seller shall
have the right to conduct the defense at its expense, whether such contest,
audit or other proceeding commenced before or commences after the Closing.
Notwithstanding Seller\'s obligations under the preceding provisions of this
Section 8.2, Seller shall have no obligation to pay or to indemnify or hold
Buyer or any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries harmless from any Tax imposed or
assessed as a result of (i) the failure of Buyer to notify Seller as required
by this paragraph, if such failure adversely affects Seller\'s ability to
respond adequately in a timely manner to the notice of contest, audit or
other proceeding, or (ii) any action taken by Buyer or any of NCNG and the
Subsidiaries with respect to any contest, audit or other proceeding without
Seller\'s written consent.   (ii) The amount of any Tax indemnification
otherwise payable by Seller under this Agreement shall be reduced by the
amount, or in the case of a Tax benefit to be realized subsequently, the
then-present value of any Tax benefit for any taxable period to the Buyer,
NCNG or any of the Subsidiaries resulting from any adjustment to or change in
any Tax item relating to NCNG or the Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date. Such present value
shall be based on a discount rate of 3% percent per annum.   (iii) The
parties agree that Seller shall be entitled to the Federal and State Income
Tax benefit resulting from compensation deductions relating to the exercise
after the Closing of options to purchase common stock of Seller by employees
or former employees of NCNG or the Subsidiaries. Seller shall claim such
deductions, and none of NCNG and the Subsidiaries shall do so unless
requested to do so by Seller. If any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries realizes
any federal or State Income Tax benefit resulting from any such deduction,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and shall promptly pay to Seller the
amount of the Tax benefit realized plus any interest paid or credited thereon
by any Governmental Authority. If and to the extent any such Tax is payable
by reason of the exercise of any such option, Seller shall withhold
(if appropriate) and pay to the appropriate Governmental Authorities all
withholding Taxes and all Taxes imposed on an employer or other payor of
wages or compensation to such employee or former employee. If, however, NCNG,
any of the Subsidiaries, or Buyer is required under any  
-33-    applicable Law to pay and, after written notice to Seller, does
pay any such Tax, then (i) Seller shall pay to Buyer, promptly after Buyer
notifies Seller in writing of the amount of Tax so paid, an amount equal to
the amount of Tax so paid (other than any withholding Tax withheld from any
payment by NCNG, any of the Subsidiaries, or Buyer) and (ii) if Seller also
pays or has paid the same or corresponding Tax and reimburses (or has
reimbursed) Buyer as provided in clause (i), Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate, and Buyer shall cause NCNG and the Subsidiaries to cooperate with
Seller, as reasonably necessary to obtain (for Seller\'s benefit) a refund or
credit of Tax to prevent or mitigate any double payment of Tax. Seller also
shall be solely responsible for the administration of any plan or agreement
under which any such option was issued.   (iv) Seller agrees to make
available to Buyer, NCNG and the Subsidiaries records in the custody of
Seller or any member of Seller\'s affiliated group, to furnish other
information and otherwise to cooperate to the extent reasonably required for
the filing of Tax Returns relating to NCNG and the Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending after the Closing Date. However, no loss, credit or
other item of any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries may be carried back without
Seller\'s written consent, which Seller may withhold in its
absolute discretion, to a taxable period for which (i) any of NCNG and the
Subsidiaries and (ii) Seller or any corporation affiliated with Seller filed
a consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Return.   (d) Termination of Tax-
Sharing Agreement. After the Closing any tax-sharing agreement between
Seller, NCNG, and the Subsidiaries will be terminated as of the Closing Date
and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether a current year
or a future year) and this Section 8.2 shall supersede any and all Tax-
sharing or similar agreements to which (i) any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and (ii) Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
are parties. Neither NCNG, the Subsidiaries, Seller nor any such Affiliates
shall have any obligation or right with respect to each other under any such
prior agreement after the Closing.   (e) Relationship of Section 8.2 to
Article IX. Any conditions or limitations, set forth in Article IX with
respect to amount of claims or liability shall not apply to any claim or
liability to which this Section 8.2 applies or to any breach of any
obligation under this Section 8.2. In the event of any inconsistency between
provisions of Article IX and Section 8.2, this Section 8.2 shall control.
Notwithstanding Article IX or any other provision of this Agreement, Seller
shall not have any liability under this Agreement for or with respect to any
Taxes of any of NCNG and the Subsidiaries except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 8.2 and as provided in Article IX for breach of any
obligation of Seller under this Section 8.2. Seller shall not have any
liability under this Section 8.2 for or with respect to any Taxes of ENCNG,
and Article IX shall govern Seller\'s liability for inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.15 with respect
to Taxes of ENCNG.   (f) Survival. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the covenants and obligations set forth in this Section 8.2
shall survive until, and any claim for indemnification with respect thereto
must be made prior to, the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the underlying Tax claim (including any valid
extensions).   (g) Taxes and Tax Returns of ENCNG. All Tax Returns and Taxes
of ENCNG are filed and paid separately from those of Seller and its
Affiliates, but Seller provides   -34-   administrative assistance to
ENCNG in the preparation of Tax Returns. Accordingly, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other and with ENCNG as necessary after Closing to
provide for the timely preparation and filing of ENCNG\'s Tax Returns for
periods (or portions of periods) ending on or before the Closing Date.  
8.3. Employee Benefits.   (a) When used in this Section 8.3 and Section
4.13(b)(ix), the following terms shall have the meanings specified:   (i)
"Buyer\'s Plan" means a defined benefit plan that is  qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and that is adopted or  designated by Buyer to receive the
Pension Plan Spinoff Amount.   (ii) "Continuing Employee" means an
individual employed by  NCNG at and after the Closing Date including active
employees and those  on leave of absence, sick-leave or short-term disability
or long-term  disability and any individual employed by Seller or its
Affiliates  whose employment is transferred to Buyer in connection with
this  transaction.   (iii) "Pension Plan" means the Progress Energy Pension
Plan.   (iv) "Pension Plan Benefit" means the accrued benefit under  the
Pension Plan of each Continuing Employee (and any alternate payee  of a
Continuing Employee), each deferred vested employee of NCNG (and  any
alternate payee or surviving spouse of such employee) and each  Retired
Employee (and such individual\'s surviving spouse, beneficiary  or alternate
payee), such amount to be computed as of the Closing Date.   (v) "Pension
Plan Spinoff Amount" means the greater of (1) the  amount of assets required
to be transferred under Code section 414(l)  with respect to Continuing
Employees (and any alternate payee of a  Continuing Employee), Retired
Employees (and any surviving spouse,  beneficiary or alternate payee of a
Retired Employee), and each  deferred vested employee of NCNG (and any
alternate payee or surviving  spouse of such employee) under the Pension
Plan, or (2) the aggregate  present value of Pension Plan Benefits, with such
amounts to be  computed by Seller\'s actuary as of the Closing Date in
accordance with  actuarial assumptions and methods specified in Schedule
8.3(a) attached  hereto.   (vi) "Retired Employee" means an individual who
was employed  by NCNG prior to the Closing Date and who retired from the
employment  of NCNG prior to the Closing Date.   (vii) "Savings Plan" means
the Progress Energy 401(k) Savings  and Stock Ownership Plan.   -35-    
(viii) "Welfare Plans" means the Employee Benefit Plans of  Seller and NCNG
that are welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section  3(1) of ERISA) and
that cover Continuing Employees and Retired  Employees.   (b) Welfare
Plans   (i) Buyer agrees to adopt and maintain welfare benefit plans  (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (the "Buyer\'s Welfare Plans")  that, as of
the Closing Date, provide benefits to Continuing Employees  and Retired
Employees and to their beneficiaries and dependents that  are substantially
equivalent to benefits provided to Buyer\'s similarly  situated employees as
of the Closing Date, subject to Buyer\'s authority  to amend, from time to
time, and/or terminate, Buyer\'s Welfare Plans.  With respect to such
Continuing Employees and Retired Employees and  their beneficiaries and
dependents, Buyer\'s Welfare Plans shall not  include a waiting or
eligibility period (except to the extent any such  Continuing Employees and
Retired Employees or their beneficiaries or  dependents are subject to a
waiting or eligibility period under the  Welfare Plans) or a preexisting
condition restriction or limitation  and, to the extent that such Continuing
Employees and Retired Employees  or their dependents or beneficiaries have
satisfied any internal  limits, deductibles or copayment requirements of the
Welfare Plans for  the year that includes the Closing Date, such amounts will
be credited  toward the satisfaction of any such requirements under Buyer\'s
Welfare  Plans to the extent normally allowed under Buyer\'s Welfare
Plan.   (ii) Seller and the Welfare Plans will remain responsible for 
administering and paying claims of Continuing Employees and Retired 
Employees, and their dependents and beneficiaries to the extent such  claims
were incurred prior to the Closing Date. Buyer and the Buyer\'s  Welfare
Plans will be responsible for administering and paying claims  of Continuing
Employees and Retired Employees and for dependents and  beneficiaries of such
employees incurred on or after the Closing Date.  Buyer agrees to transfer to
Seller any amounts accurately reserved on  the books of NCNG as of the
Closing Date for claims under the Welfare  Plans that have been incurred but
not reported as of the Closing Date.   (iii) Buyer and Buyer\'s Welfare
Plans will be responsible for  claims incurred at or after the Closing Date
by Continuing Employees  who cease to be employed on or after the Closing
Date and for  dependents and beneficiaries of such Continuing Employees.
Buyer and  Buyer\'s Welfare Plans shall be responsible for any continuation 
coverage obligations under COBRA with respect to each Continuing  Employee
and each qualifying beneficiary (as defined in Section  4980B(g) of the Code)
of a Continuing Employee or Retired Employee with  respect to any qualifying
event (as defined in Section 4980B(f) of the  Code) that occurs on or after
the Closing Date.   (iv) Seller agrees to transfer to Buyer\'s Welfare Plans
the  aggregate of the salary-reduction contributions as of the Closing Date 
less the aggregate amount of claims paid for all Continuing Employees  who
are participants in the health and dependent care reimbursement  accounts
under the Welfare Plans. Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer\'s  Welfare Plans to
continue after the Closing Date and until the end of  the plan   -36-   
year or the individual\'s termination of employment, whichever is  earlier,
any salary-reduction election in place under such  reimbursement accounts as
of the Closing Date at the same level as in  effect as of the Closing Date.
Seller and the Welfare Plans will be  responsible for claims submitted prior
to the Closing Date and Buyer  and Buyer\'s Welfare Plans will be responsible
for claims submitted on  or after the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller agree
that they will do  everything necessary or appropriate to effectuate within
90 days  following the Closing Date the transfer and accounting of amounts 
contributable to the health and dependent care reimbursement accounts.   (c)
Buyer shall be responsible for workers\' compensation benefits including, but
not limited to, payments for indemnity, medical expenses and settlements,
that are payable on or after the Closing Date, regardless of whether the
injury, accident or illness occurred before the Closing Date and shall pay
such benefits or promptly reimburse Seller for any such benefits paid by
Seller. Seller shall be responsible for workers\' compensation benefits
that are payable before the Closing Date.   (d) Pension Plans   (i) Buyer
agrees that the Buyer\'s Plan shall, as of the  Closing Date, provide
benefits to Continuing Employees that are at  least substantially equivalent
to such benefits provided to similarly  situated employees of the Buyer as of
the Closing Date, subject to  Buyer\'s authority to amend, from time to time,
and/or terminate,  Buyer\'s Plan. Buyer agrees that, with respect to any
Continuing  Employee, Buyer\'s Plan shall recognize all service with Seller,
NCNG,  and Affiliates of Seller prior to the Closing Date, to the same
extent  that such service is recognized for such purposes under the Pension 
Plan as of the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting, 
eligibility for early retirement and with respect to the Pension Plan 
Benefit accrued prior to the Closing Date, for benefit accrual  purposes.
Buyer\'s Plan shall also recognize service with Buyer earned  by Continuing
Employees after the Closing Date for all purposes under  the Buyer\'s Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing in no event shall the  aforementioned service
credit result in any duplication of service or  benefits for any purpose
under the Buyer\'s Plan.   (ii) Buyer agrees to cause Buyer\'s Plan to
assume liability  for the Pension Plan Benefits which accrued prior to the
Closing Date;  provided, however, that the receipt by Buyer\'s Plan of the
Pension Plan  Spinoff Amount shall be a condition precedent to the assumption
of such  liability. Buyer and Seller agree to comply with all rules and 
procedures established by the IRS and the PBGC with respect to the 
assumption of such liability.   (iii) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall amend the  Pension Plan to fully vest each Continuing Employee in his
accrued  benefit under such plan. Seller agrees to cause the trustee of the 
Pension Plan to transfer the Pension Plan Spinoff Amount as soon as 
practicable after Seller has received from the Buyer all necessary 
approvals, authorizations, information or similar requirements. Buyer  and
Seller agree to comply with all rules and procedures established by  the IRS
and the PBGC with respect to such transfer. Buyer warrants  that, as of each
date of transfer, the IRS will have   -37-    determined that the
Buyer\'s Plan is qualified in its form, and its  concomitant trust exempt
from Tax, under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of  the Code, respectively.  
(iv) Buyer and Seller shall take such actions as are necessary  or
appropriate to accomplish the transfer of the Pension Plan Spinoff  Amount
and the liability for the Pension Plan Benefits to the Buyer\'s  Plan
including, without limitation, the timely filing of IRS Forms  5310-A and the
timely filing of any necessary PBGC filings.   (v) Any calculations of the
amount to be transferred under  this Section 8.3 by Seller\'s actuary shall
be subject to review and  mutual agreement between Buyer\'s and Seller\'s
actuaries, which  agreement will not be unreasonably withheld by either
party.   (e) As of the Closing Date, Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate in Buyer\'s defined contribution plan that is
qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code ("Buyer\'s 401(k)
Plan") on the same basis as Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan is offered to similarly-
situated employees of Buyer, subject to Buyer\'s authority to amend, from
time to time, and/or terminate, Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan. Buyer further agrees
that, as of the Closing Date, the Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan shall provide benefits
that, taken as a whole, are at least substantially equivalent to the benefits
provided to Buyer\'s similarly situated employees as of the Closing Date.
Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan shall accept Continuing Employees\' "eligible rollover
distributions" (as defined in Section 402(c) of the Code, excluding, however,
after-tax contributions) in cash and participant loans from the Savings Plan
(only to the extent such acceptance with respect to such participant loans
does not require any departure from the participant loan-related requirements
under the Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan). Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan shall recognize, for
purposes of eligibility and vesting, prior service with Seller, NCNG and
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the same extent that such service is

agrees to provide the benefit obligations remaining as of the Closing Date
under the Employee Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 8.3(f) hereof.   (g)
Buyer agrees that it will credit (or cause NCNG to credit) Continuing
Employees with vacation time that is earned under the terms of Seller\'s
vacation policies in effect prior to the Closing Date but is unused as of the
Closing Date to the extent accrued on the NCNG books, and Buyer
will recognize (or cause NCNG to recognize) service with Seller, NCNG and
their respective Affiliates for purposes of earning vacation time from and
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to
the contrary, neither Buyer nor NCNG or any of the Subsidiaries shall be
required to make any cash payments to any Continuing Employees or other
persons in respect of any such vacation time in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (h) Buyer agrees that it
will recognize (or cause NCNG to recognize) service with Seller, NCNG and
their respective Affiliates both before and after the Closing Date for
purposes of the payment of any severance benefits; provided, however, that
the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates sponsor any severance or   -38-   similar plan of general
applicability to any employees (except that severance benefits are provided
under certain employment agreements and are sometimes provided on an ad hoc
basis in connection with specific transactions), but if any transaction-
specific severance benefits plan is adopted for Continuing Employees, it will
take into account service with Seller, NCNG and their respective
Affiliates.   8.4. WARN Act. Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify Seller against, all expense and liability, including reasonable
attorneys\' fees, if applicable, incurred under the WARN Act or any other Law
requiring notice prior to termination of employment or the payment of
severance pay, wages or benefits with respect to any employee who experiences
a layoff, employment termination, reduction in hours or other employment
related loss on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for,
and shall indemnify Buyer against, all expense and liability, including
reasonable attorneys\' fees, if applicable, incurred under the WARN Act or
any other Law requiring notice prior to termination of employment or the
payment of severance pay, wages or benefits with respect to any employee who
experiences a layoff, employment termination, reduction in hours or other
employment related loss prior to the Closing Date, or who was notified by
Seller of any such event prior to the Closing Date. The Seller shall notify
Buyer of any and all WARN notices applicable to the transactions contemplated
herein that have been issued by Seller from the time of signing this
Agreement up to the time of Closing.   8.5. Satisfaction of Debt. At or
prior to Closing, Seller shall take, or cause NCNG to take, such actions as
are necessary to satisfy or extinguish all intercompany debt obligations
between NCNG, as borrower, and any of Seller or Seller\'s Affiliates.  
8.6. Further Assurances as to ENCNG Rights and Obligations. Upon request of
the Seller from time to time after the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller will
take or cause to be taken such actions as may be reasonably required for the
complete assigning, transferring, granting, assuring and confirming to the
Seller and APEC, their respective successors and assigns of, and for
aiding and assisting in obtaining or collecting and reducing to possession,
any or all of the ENCNG Rights and Obligations.   ARTICLE IX  SURVIVAL;
INDEMNIFICATION   9.1. Limitation on and Survival of Representations and
Warranties.   (a) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no representations
or warranties have been made by Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for those representations
and warranties made in Article III and Article IV hereof, or in any other
agreements executed by the parties and delivered at Closing pursuant to this
Agreement.   (b) Subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 9.1,
all representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, or in any
agreements or instruments executed in connection herewith or delivered
pursuant hereto, shall survive the Closing for a period of one year beginning
on the Closing Date, but not longer; provided, however, that the
representations   -39-   and warranties contained in Section 3.2
(Ownership), Section 3.3 (Due Authorization), Section 4.1 (Organization,
Capitalization of NCNG), Section 4.2 (Organization, Capitalization of ENCNG),
Section 4.3 (Subsidiaries), Section 4.13 (Employee Benefits) and, solely with
respect to ENCNG, Section 4.15 (Taxes) shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations for the matter giving rise to a claim
hereunder. Such representations and warranties shall only be effective with
respect to any breach or claim when notice of such breach or claim shall have
been given in writing to the other party in breach or against whom
indemnification is sought within such period. Any claim for indemnification
for which notice has been given within the prescribed period may be
prosecuted to conclusion notwithstanding the subsequent expiration of
such period. No party to this Agreement shall be entitled to pursue any
remedy for the breach of any representation or warranty to the extent such
party was informed of such breach prior to the Closing Date and such party
proceeds with the Closing.   9.2. Indemnification by Seller.   (a)
Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.4, and Section
8.2, Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Buyer, NCNG, or any
successors or assigns thereof, and their employees, officers, directors
and affiliates (each a "Buyer Indemnified Party") harmless from and against
any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, judgments, losses,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys\' fees) (collectively, "Losses") imposed upon or
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with
any of the following:   (i) Any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty  made by Seller in Article III, Article IV, or Section 8.4 of this 
Agreement, or in any other agreements executed by the parties and  delivered
at Closing pursuant to this Agreement; or   (ii) The breach of, or default
in the performance by Seller  of, any covenant, agreement or obligation to be
performed by Seller  pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument executed in  connection herewith or pursuant hereto.   (b)
Within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Buyer of notice of an Action or
other event giving rise to a Buyer Claim with respect to which a Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9.2, the
Buyer shall notify (the "Buyer Claim Notice") Seller in writing of
the commencement of such Action or the assertion of such Buyer Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect the
right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent of actual prejudice
to Seller. Seller shall have the option, and shall notify the Buyer
Indemnified Party in writing within ten Business Days after the date of the
Buyer Claim Notice of its election, either: (A) to participate (at the
expense of Seller) in the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim (in which
case the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim shall be controlled by the
Buyer Indemnified Party) or (B) to take charge of and control the defense of
such Action or Buyer Claim (at the expense of Seller). If Seller elects to
control the defense, it will not compromise or settle the Action or Buyer
Claim if (X) the amount to be paid in settlement exceeds the Maximum
Indemnity Amount or (Y) the settlement does not include a provision releasing
the Buyer Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect thereto. If
Seller fails to notify the Buyer Indemnified Party of its election within the
applicable response   -40-    period, then Seller shall be deemed to
have elected not to control the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim. If
Seller elects to control the defense of any Action or Buyer Claim, the Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and
participate in the defense of such Action or Buyer Claim, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Buyer Indemnified
Party unless: (1) the named parties in such Action or Buyer Claim (including
any impleaded parties) include both the Buyer Indemnified Party and an
indemnifying party and the Buyer Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it
that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying
party, or (2) the Buyer Indemnified Party has reasonably determined that
Losses that may be incurred may exceed either individually, or
when aggregated with other Buyer Claims, the Maximum Indemnity Amount (in
which case, Seller shall not have the right to control the defense of such
Action or Buyer Claim on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Party, it being
understood, however, that the Seller shall not, in connection with such
Action or Buyer Claim, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).   (c) If
Seller does not control the defense of any Action or Buyer Claim, then the
Buyer Indemnified Party may settle such Action or Buyer Claim with the
written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld).   9.3.
Indemnification by Buyer.   (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.4, the Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Seller and its
employees, officers, directors and affiliates (each a "Seller Indemnified
Party") harmless from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred
by any Seller Indemnified Party (any of such Losses by Seller, a "Seller
Claim") as a result of or in connection with any of the following:   (i)
Any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty  made by the Buyer
in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument  executed in connection
herewith or pursuant hereto;   (ii) The breach of or default in the
performance by the Buyer  of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be
performed by the Buyer  pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument executed in  connection herewith or pursuant hereto; and   (iii)
The conduct of NCNG\'s and the Subsidiaries\' businesses  after the Closing,
including but not limited to Buyer\'s obligation to  comply with the WARN Act
or any other Law as set forth in Section 8.4.   (b) Within sixty (60) days
after receipt by Seller of notice of the commencement of an Action or other
event giving rise to a Seller Claim with respect to which a Seller
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification, the party receiving such
notice shall notify (the "Seller Claim Notice") Buyer in writing of the
commencement of such Action or the assertion of such Seller Claim; provided,
however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect   -41-   the
right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent of actual
prejudice to Buyer. Buyer shall have the option, and shall notify each
indemnified party in writing within ten Business Days after the date of the
Seller Claim of its election, either: (A) to participate (at its own expense)
in the defense of the Action or Seller Claim (in which case the defense of
such Action or Seller Claim shall be controlled by the Seller Indemnified
Party) or (B) to take charge of and control defense of such Action or Seller
Claim (at its own expense). If Buyer fails to notify the Seller Indemnified
Party of its election within the applicable response period, then Buyer shall
be deemed to have elected not to control the defense of such Action or Seller
Claim. If Buyer elects to control the defense of any Action or Seller Claim,
each Seller Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and participate in the defense of any such Action or Seller Claim, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Seller
Indemnified Party unless: (1) the named parties in such Action or Seller
Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Seller Indemnified
Party and Buyer and the Seller Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it
that are different from or additional to those available to Buyer, or (2)
Seller has reasonably determined that Losses that may be incurred may exceed
either individually, or when aggregated with other Seller Claims, the Maximum
Indemnity Amount (in which case, Buyer shall not have the right to assume the
defense of such Action or Seller Claim on behalf of the Seller Indemnified
Party, it being understood, however, that Buyer shall not, in connection with
such Action or Seller Claim be liable for the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm of attorneys (in additional to any local counsel) and that
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred).   (c) If
Buyer does not control the defense of any Action or Seller Claim, then the
Seller Indemnified Party or parties may settle such Action or Seller Claim
with the written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld).   9.4.
Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Seller shall not
be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Buyer shall not
be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article IX unless and until the amount of all Losses incurred by Buyer, or by
Seller, as the case may be, exceeds $3,000,000 in the aggregate
(the "Basket"), in which event the party seeking indemnity may recover all
Losses incurred in excess of the Basket from the first dollar above the
Basket, and (ii) Seller\'s maximum liability for Losses under Section 9.2 and
Buyer\'s maximum liability for Losses under Section 9.3 shall be, in each
case, 20% of the Purchase Price (the "Maximum Indemnity Amount"); provided,
however, that neither the Basket nor the Maximum Indemnity Amount shall apply
to the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.2
(Ownership), Section 3.3 (Due Authorization), Section 4.1 (Organization,
Capitalization of NCNG), Section 4.2 (Organization, Capitalization of ENCNG),
Section 4.3 (Subsidiaries), Section 4.15 (Taxes; but solely with respect to
ENCNG and without giving effect to any reference to materiality qualifiers),
Section 6.1 (Conduct of Business), Section 6.5 (Employee Benefit Matters),
and Section 8.5 (Satisfaction of Debt).   9.5. Indemnity Amounts to be
computed on After-Tax Basis. The amount of any indemnification payable under
any of the provisions of this Article IX shall be (i) net of any Federal or
State Income Tax benefit realized or the then present value (based on a
discount rate of 3%) of any such income Tax benefit to be realized by the
indemnified party (or, where Buyer   -42-   is the indemnified party, any
of NCNG and the Subsidiaries) by reason of the facts and circumstances giving
rise to the indemnification, and (ii) increased by the amount of any Federal
or State Income Tax required to be paid by the indemnified party on the
accrual or receipt of the indemnification payment (including any amount
payable pursuant to this clause (ii)). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the amount of any State Income Tax benefit or cost shall take into
account the Federal Income Tax effect of such benefit or cost.   9.6.
Exclusive Remedy. After the Closing, the parties\' sole and exclusive
recourse against each other for any Loss or claim of Losses arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be expressly limited to the provisions of
this Article IX. Seller shall not have any right of contribution from NCNG or
the Subsidiaries with respect to any Loss claimed by Buyer.   ARTICLE X 
TERMINATION   10.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time,
prior to the Closing only as follows:   (a) by mutual written consent of
the Buyer and Seller;   (b) by the Buyer or Seller if the Closing Date shall
not have occurred on or before December 31, 2003 (provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to
occur on or before such date); or   (c) by the Buyer or Seller, if any
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United States
governmental body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable.   10.2. Effect of Termination. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, all further obligations
of the parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate without
further liability of either party to the other; provided, however, the
obligations contained in this Section 10.2, Section 6.6, Section 6.5, and
Section 11.2 of this Agreement shall survive any such termination. Nothing
contained in this Section 10.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of this Agreement.   10.3. Amendment. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the parties.
