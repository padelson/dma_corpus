DELL INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Dell_ "), UNIVERSAL ACQUISITION CO., a
Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger
Sub_ "), and EMC CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has, by unanimous vote of all
of the directors, (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, and declared it advisable, for the Company to
enter into this Agreement, (ii) adopted this Agreement and approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") and (iii) resolved to recommend approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has unanimously approved and
declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has unanimously
approved and declared advisable, this Agreement and the Merger, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger,
together with related transactions, qualifies as an exchange within the
meaning of Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and

 

WHEREAS, Dell will receive direct benefits from the Merger, including as a
result of the expected contribution of the Company to Dell following the
Effective Time.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business Day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of those conditions at the
Closing); _provided_ , that, if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior
to the time the Closing would have otherwise been required to occur pursuant
to the foregoing, the Closing shall not occur until the earlier to occur of
(a) a Business Day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no fewer
than three Business Days written notice to the Company (it being understood
that such date may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of
Parents financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (b)
the first Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period
(subject in each of the case of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of all of
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI for the Closing as of the date
determined pursuant to this proviso). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Closing may be consummated at such other time or date as Parent and the
Company may agree to in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be
held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 2475 Hanover Street,
Palo Alto, California 94304, unless another place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company.

 



1 Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts articles of
merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") and by filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), in each case in such form as required by, and executed and
acknowledged by the parties in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
MBCA and DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under
the MBCA and DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Articles of Merger
and the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the MBCA and the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.05 _Articles of Organization and Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Restated Articles of Organization of the
Company (the " _Company Articles_ ") shall be amended as a result of the
Merger so as to read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and,
as so amended, shall be the articles of organization of the Surviving
Corporation until, subject to Section 5.06(a), thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company
(the " _Company Bylaws_ ") shall be amended so as to read in their entirety
as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until, subject to Section 5.06(a),
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.06 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be.

Section 1.07 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of
the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "), or of any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



2 (b) _Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly
or indirectly owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Stock Owned by Subsidiaries of the Company_. Each share of Company Common
Stock beneficially owned by a Subsidiary of the Company which is directly or
indirectly wholly-owned by the Company shall be converted into and become a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation equal in value
to such converted shares of Company Common Stock.

(d) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but excluding (x) shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.01(b), (y) shares to be converted in accordance with
Section 2.01(c) and (z) any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive (A) a number of shares of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value, $0.01 per share, designated
as Class V Common Stock (the " _Class V Common Stock_ ") of Parent (the "
_Stock Consideration_ ") having terms as set forth in the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto
to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and made
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Parent
Certificate_ ") equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest five decimal
points) obtained by dividing (I) 222,966,450 by (II) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including shares issued as a result of vesting of Company
Equity Awards and shares contributed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates, in each case as contemplated by Section 5.04) (which aggregate
number will be set forth in a certificate of the Company delivered as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (B) $24.05 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the
Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(d) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), without interest, in each case to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 2.01 upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 2.02(b), in the case of certificated shares, and immediately, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares.

 

(ii) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a
change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Cash Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 2.01(d)(ii) shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the right of any holder
of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) shall, to the extent

3 (e) _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(i) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted
such shares in favor of this Agreement and who are entitled to appraisal
rights and have properly exercised such rights in accordance with Part 13 of
the MBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(d), and the
holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by, and
shall be entitled only to receive such payments for such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with, Part 13 of the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any

waive, withdraw or lose such shareholders rights under Part 13 of the
MBCA or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise determine that
such shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Part 13 of the
MBCA, such shareholders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease
to be Dissenting Shares (including for purposes of Section 2.01(d)(i)), and
shall be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon)
upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing
such shares of Company Common Stock and related documents, as compensation for
such cancellation. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall be

Book-Entry Shares, book-entry shares (or certificates if requested)
representing shares of Class V Common Stock, and cash, in each case in an
aggregate amount equal to the number of shares or amount of cash (as

shares if the Merger is effectuated pursuant to Section 13.21(a) of the MBCA.
In addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time at or after the Effective Time, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). All shares of Class V

Stock, cash, dividends and distributions contemplated to be issued and
delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(d), Section 2.02(c) and Section 2.02(e) out
of the Exchange Fund. Except to the extent set forth in Section 2.02(h), the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



4 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock that were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form
and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e).
Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of such Certificates, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(d), (ii) shares of Class V Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by such holder of
record) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(d) (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration), (iii) any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (iv) cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
of the Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) may be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, as applicable, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder
of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
ARTICLE II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent
of an "agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each such share of Company Common Stock, together with any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the
Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Class V Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any 

 



5  unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of
Class V Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Class
V Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e),
in each case until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry Share along with a duly
executed letter of transmittal (or upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an
"agents message" as contemplated in Section 2.02(b)(iii)) in accordance with
this ARTICLE II. Following the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share along with a duly executed letter of transmittal (or upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of an "agents message" as contemplated in Section
2.02(b)(iii)), there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Class V Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender or receipt, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Class V Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Class V Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and (B) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or
receipt and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or receipt payable
with respect to such whole shares of Class V Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or immediately, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by the Company on the shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery thereof and
exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Class V Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon the conversion of Book-Entry
Shares, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Class V Common Stock shall receive in
lieu thereof cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
all Certificates surrendered by such holder and all Book-Entry Shares
formerly held by such holder that are converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the average closing
price of a share of VMware Class A Common Stock over the ten (10) trading day
period prior to the Effective Time (as such closing price is reported on the
NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
such other source as Parent may determine)).

 

(f) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and, subject to Section
2.02(g), Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) in accordance with this ARTICLE II.

 



6 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Class V Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions
from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to four years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
(and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares (and any
dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that any
investment of cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal
and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
banks that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If
for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case pursuant to this ARTICLE II.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and any other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent determine are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide the common
equity financing set forth in the applicable Common Equity Purchase Agreement
(the " _Common Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) an executed commitment letter
(including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, and each fee letter (each, a " _Fee Letter_
") associated therewith which Fee Letter has been redacted in a customary
manner solely with respect to fee amounts, yield or interest rate caps,
original issue discount amounts and "flex" and "securities demand" terms and
other similar economic terms that are confidential and do not adversely affect
the enforceability, availability or conditionality of or the aggregate amount
of net proceeds available under the Debt Financing), dated the date hereof
(the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Common Equity
Purchase Agreements the " _Commitment Papers_ ") from Credit Suisse AG, Cayman
Islands Branch, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch,
Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Capital
Markets, pursuant to which each of such persons has committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt financing set forth therein
(the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Common Equity Financing, the
" _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Commitment Papers
have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived in any
respect, (ii) the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Papers
have not been terminated, withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded in any
respect and no such amendment, restatement, modification, waiver, withdrawal,
repudiation or rescission is contemplated (other than any such amendment,
restatement or modification to add Financing Sources, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof), and (iii) except as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Papers, there are no side letters or Contracts or
understandings related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing (or any portion thereof). As of the date of
this Agreement, the Commitment Papers are in full force and effect and
constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of each of Parent and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies to the funding of the full amount of the Financing (or any
portion thereof) other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Papers.
Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and
Section 6.02, the net proceeds of the Common Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing, together with (A) Parents and Dells available cash on hand and
the proceeds of loans available under existing revolving credit facilities of
Parent and Dell, in each case, to the extent permitted to be used without
restriction, for the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the Closing Date, and (B) the Target Amount of Cash on Hand
to be made available by the Company at the Effective Time, will, in
the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of any amounts
required to be paid pursuant to Article II, the repayment, redemption,
discharge or refinancing of any indebtedness required by the Debt Commitment
Letter, and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, and
required to be paid on or prior to the date of the Closing. As of the date of
this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01 and Section 6.02, no event has occurred or circumstance exists
which would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default), in each case, on the part
of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Commitment
Papers, under the Commitment Papers or would otherwise result in any portion
of the Financing not being available. As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and
Section 6.02, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by it or
its Subsidiaries contained in the Commitment Papers or that the full amounts
committed pursuant to each of the Commitment Papers will not be available on
or before the date of the Closing. Parent has fully paid all fees required to
be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, and there

 



26  are no fees required to be paid pursuant to the Common Equity Purchase
Agreements. Dell and its Subsidiaries have available cash on hand and
available borrowing capacity under existing revolving credit facilities in an
aggregate amount no less than the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee, in
each case, available without restriction for the purpose of paying (A) in full
the Reverse Termination Fee if and when due and payable in accordance with
this Agreement or (B) if the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee is payable in
lieu of the Reverse Termination Fee, available without restriction for the
purpose of paying a portion of the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee
no less than the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee (provided that the
foregoing representation as to Dells available cash on hand and borrowing
capacity shall not impair the Companys rights to seek payment in full of the
Alternative Reverse Termination Fee, if and when due and payable in
accordance with this Agreement).

(h) _Class V Common Stock_. Except for shares of Class V Common Stock
contemplated to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or as set forth on
Section 3.02(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, (x) there are not issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of Class V Common Stock,
(B) any securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Class V Common Stock, (C) any
warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
any shares of Class V Common Stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Class V Common Stock or (D) any
stock appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights
to receive shares of Class V Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights
that are linked to the value of Class V Common Stock and (y) there are not
any outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Class V Common Stock or
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such
shares of Class V Common Stock. All shares of Class V Common Stock, when
issued hereunder, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and will not be subject to or issued in violation of any
preemptive or similar right, purchase option, call or right of first refusal
or similar right and will be issued free and clear of Liens (other than Liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable or for Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves, in accordance with GAAP, have been established, and any
restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable securities Laws).

(i)  _Financial Statements_. Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has
provided to the Company true and correct copies of (i) the audited
consolidated financial statements of Parent (including the balance sheet, and
statements of operations and cash flows) as of and for the period ended
January 30, 2015, (ii) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
Parent (including the balance sheet, and statements of operations and cash
flows) as of and for the period ended July 31, 2015, (iii) the audited
consolidated financial statements of Dell (including the balance sheet, and
statements of operations and cash flows) as of and for the period ended
January 30, 2015, (iv) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
Dell (including the balance sheet, and statements of operations and cash
flows) as of and for the period ended July 31, 2015 (the statements set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Parent Financial Statements_ " and the
statements set forth in clauses (iii) and (iv), the " _Dell Financial
Statements_ "). The Parent Financial Statements and the Dell Financial
Statements were prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its Subsidiaries or Dell and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the dates
thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein,
including the notes thereto). Except as disclosed, reflected or reserved
against in the balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of July 31,
2015, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, known or unknown,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of July 31, 2015, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, does any
basis exist therefor, other than (A) liabilities or obligations incurred since
July 31, 2015 in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (B) liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant to Contracts
entered into after the date hereof not in violation of this Agreement, (C)
liabilities or obligations incurred in connection with this Agreement or any
of 

 



27  the transactions contemplated hereby or (D) liabilities or obligations that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(j) _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent, Dell or Merger Sub that would be required to be paid by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or that will be
allocated to the shares of Class V Common Stock. None of Parent, Dell, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has entered into any
Contract, arrangement or understanding with any person (i) awarding any
person any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis that would prevent
such person from acting as financial advisor in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) solely with respect to the Financing Sources for the Debt
Financing, prohibiting or seeking to prohibit such person from providing or
seeking to provide financing to any person in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(k) _Prior Activity; Capitalization of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub is newly formed
and has not conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement, nor
has Merger Sub, prior to the Effective Time, had assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub consists of 1000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, ten (10) shares of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is directly owned by
Parent. Merger Sub has no outstanding options, warrants, rights, or any other
agreement pursuant to which any person other than Parent may directly or
indirectly acquire any equity security of Merger Sub.

 

(l) _Solvency_. None of Parent, Dell or Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Surviving Corporation. Assuming (i) the accuracy in
all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in Section 3.01 and in any certificate delivered pursuant to the
terms hereof, (ii) the performance in all material respects by the Company of
its obligations hereunder, (iii) the Companys and VMwares financial
statements (including the related notes) included in the Company
SEC Documents or the VMware SEC Documents fairly presented in all material
respects the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or of VMware and its Subsidiaries (as applicable) as of the end
of the period covered thereby and the consolidated results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or of VMware and its Subsidiaries (as
applicable) for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other
adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto), (iv) any
estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries
delivered by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable and
(v) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Company will,
immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Financing and the payment of any amounts required to
be paid pursuant to ARTICLE II, the repayment, redemption, discharge or
refinancing of any indebtedness required as a result of consummation of the
Merger, and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing), be
Solvent. " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of determination and with
respect to any person: (x) the present fair saleable value of the properties,
rights and assets of such person and its Subsidiaries exceeds the total
liabilities of such person and its Subsidiaries (including a reasonable
estimate of the contingent liabilities that would be recorded in accordance
with GAAP), (y) the capital of such person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to the business of such person
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (z) such person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have debts beyond their ability to pay
such debts as they mature in the ordinary course of business.

 

(m) _Tax Treatment_. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action, and to the
Knowledge of Parent there are no facts, agreements, plans or other
circumstances, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
Merger, taken together with related transactions, from qualifying as an
exchange described in Section 351 of the Code.

Section 4.02 _Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during
the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59
p.m. (Eastern time) on December 11, 2015 (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_
"), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
shall have the right to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)
solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate or assist or cooperate with respect
to, any Acquisition Proposal from any person that is not an Affiliate of the
Company or the making thereof and (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any
information or data in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal to any person
that is not an Affiliate of the Company pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement on terms, that taken as a whole, are not materially
more favorable to such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the making, or
amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal) and which does not prohibit the Company
from complying with its obligations under this Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), _provided_ , that all such information and
data has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to
or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person. No
later than 24 hours after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each person from whom the
Company has received an Acquisition Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date that has not been withdrawn and for which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
provide to Parent (x) a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal made in writing

 



33  and any other written terms or proposals provided (including financing
commitments) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) a written
summary of the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal not made in
writing (including any material terms proposed orally or supplementally).

(b) Except as expressly permitted under Section 4.02(a), from the date of
this Agreement the Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate
or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate or knowingly induce, the
making of any Acquisition Proposal, or the making of any inquiry, offer or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, facilitate, continue or otherwise participate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person
any information or data or afford access to the business,
directors, officers, employees, properties, facilities, assets, contracts,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date or in
accordance with this Section 4.02(b)), (iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail
to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any
person (other than Parent) with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (unless the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal advisors, that the failure to so waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law), (v) take any action to make the provisions of
any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation, or any
restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company
Articles or Company Bylaws, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated
by any Acquisition Proposal or (vi) authorize any of, or commit or agree to
do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this Section 4.02(b) by the Company. On the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted theretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02(b) to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal from a person that is not an Affiliate of
the Company that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal advisors and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal
was not solicited after the No-Shop Period Start Date in violation of this
Section 4.02(b), the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section
4.02, (x) furnish information or data with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person that is not an Affiliate of the Company making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ , that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, if
the Company has received, following the date hereof and prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date, a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company
may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 4.02(x) and (y)
above with respect to the person who made such Acquisition Proposal and shall
not be required to request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith,
including with respect to any amended or new proposal submitted by such person
following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, in each case for so long as such Acquisition
Proposal continues to qualify as the type of Acquisition Proposal for which
the Company would be permitted to engage in the activities described in
Section 4.02(x) and (y) above if such Acquisition Proposal had been made after
the No-Shop Period Start Date.

 



34 The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any person relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, of assets (including
equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that
constitute more than 20% of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or more than 20% of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person beneficially owning more than 20% of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or (iii) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, extraordinary
dividend or distribution, repurchase or redemption of common stock, share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company, in each of cases (i)
through (iii), other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer from
any person that is not an Affiliate of the Company that if consummated would
result in such person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly,
(i) more than 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or
of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect
parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or (ii) assets (including equity
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) or businesses that constitute
more than 50% of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which the Board of Directors
of the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with its outside
legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation),
taking into account all financial, legal, timing, regulatory and other aspects
of such proposal or offer (including any break-up fee, expense reimbursement
provisions, conditions to consummation and financing terms) and the person
making the proposal or offer to be more favorable to the shareholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (after giving effect to any changes to the financial terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing prior to the time of such
determination).

(c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) make a Change of Recommendation; or (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or submit to a
vote of the shareholders of the Company a merger agreement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement,
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract or any
tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any
Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") (whether
before or after the No-Shop Period Start Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and subject
to compliance with Section 4.02(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may
(A) make a Change of Recommendation other than in response to an Acquisition
Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal advisors, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and/or (B) make a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
under Section 7.01(d)(ii) and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
in response to an Acquisition Proposal if (x) the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized recognition) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal advisors) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Change of Recommendation and the Company shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement under Section 7.01(d)(ii) unless (i) the Company has complied
in all material respects with this Section 4.02, (ii) the Company promptly
notifies Parent, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days before taking
that action, of its intention to take such action (which notification shall
specify the details of the event giving rise to the Change of Recommendation
and, if applicable, the identity of the person making an Acquisition Proposal
that was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal and the material terms
thereof, together with copies of any written offer or proposal, proposed
definitive agreement, proposed or

 



35  committed financing documentation and any other related documents in respect
of such Acquisition Proposal), (iii) during such five (5)-Business Day period,
if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall meet and
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to amend
the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner as would permit
the Board of Directors of the Company or the Company to not take such
actions, and (iv) following the end of such five (5)-Business Day period, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal advisors, and taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent following any notice
provided pursuant to this Section 4.02(d) or otherwise, that the failure to
take such action would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and, in the case of a Change of Recommendation in
response to an Acquisition Proposal or termination under Section 7.01(d)(ii),
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such notice
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
(A) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to which the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal advisors and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that, if consummated, would result in the holders of Company
Common Stock receiving consideration valued at 115% or more of the Merger
Consideration (measured as the cash or fair market value of the applicable
consideration), and (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
requirements of this Section 4.02(d) shall not apply to such Acquisition
Proposal, any amendment thereof or any new Acquisition Proposal from such
person meeting the requirements set forth in clause (A) of this proviso; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms or conditions (including the provision of financing) of the
Acquisition Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal
(other than an Acquisition Proposal described in clause (A) of the foregoing
proviso) shall require a new written notification from the Company and an
additional two (2)-Business Day period that (other than as to the five (5)
Business Day time periods set forth herein) satisfies this Section 4.02(d).

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in clauses (a),
(b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02, after the No-Shop Period Start Date
the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours
after receipt) notify Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acquisition Proposal received prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date which was withdrawn prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date), such
notice to include the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal
and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, including draft agreements or term
sheets, financing commitments and other related documents submitted in
connection therewith (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably
detailed written description of such Acquisition Proposal), including any
material modifications thereto. Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall (x) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of
the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any
Acquisition Proposal and (y) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause
the Companys Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing such information or the information contemplated by the last
sentence of Section 4.02(a) to Parent or otherwise limits or impairs the
Companys or its Subsidiaries or Representatives ability to comply with
their respective obligations in this Section 4.02.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
disclosure or statement will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including this Section 4.02.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, VMware and its
Subsidiaries shall not be considered a Subsidiary of the Company required to
comply or for which the Company is obligated to cause to comply with this
Section 4.02; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company and its other
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not, directly or
indirectly through another person, encourage, cause, recommend,

 



36  or facilitate (x) the taking of any action by VMware or its Subsidiaries of
the type contemplated by Section 4.02(b) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal related to the Company and  _provided_ , _further_ , that for the
purposes of this Section 4.02, directors of VMware who are also directors of
the Company shall not constitute Representatives of the Company, to the extent
acting in the capacities as directors of VMware, (y) the making of an
Acquisition Proposal by VMware or its Subsidiaries or (z) the solicitation,
initiation or knowing encouragement by VMware or its Subsidiaries, or knowing
facilitation or knowing inducement by VMware or its Subsidiaries, of (1) the
making of any Acquisition Proposal by any other person, or (2) the making of
any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal by any other person.

 

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.01 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement;
Shareholders  Meetings._

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parents reasonable cooperation) shall
prepare and file with the SEC the proxy statement (together with the letter to
shareholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy and any other document
incorporated by reference therein, each as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the shareholders of
the Company relating to the meeting of the Companys shareholders to be held
to consider approval of this Agreement (the " _Company Shareholders
 Meeting_") and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Class V Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and, prior to the
effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall take all action reasonably
required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which
it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process
in any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable state securities
Laws in connection with the Merger and the issuance of the Class V Common
Stock. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and
the Company shall furnish all information (including financial information)
as may be reasonably requested by the other that is customarily included in a
proxy statement or registration statement on Form S-4 prepared in connection
with a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise
required by the SEC or applicable Law, in connection with any such action and
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement, including in response to any comments from the SEC. As promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective (but in any event
not before the No-Shop Period Start Date), the Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its shareholders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Form S-4 (or responses to any written comments of the SEC with respect
thereto) will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement (or responses to any written comments of the SEC with
respect thereto) will be made by the Company, in each case without providing
the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
Parent and the Company will consider in good faith any comments reasonably
proposed by the other party and shall not file or mail any such document or
respond to any written comments of the SEC prior to receiving the approval of
the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in

 



37  light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of Parent and the Company. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the
qualification of the Class V Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC
or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.

 

(b) The Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting (with a record date and meeting date to be selected
after reasonable consultation with Parent) on a date as soon as reasonably
practicable following the effectiveness of the Form S-4 solely for the purpose
of (i) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and shall, subject to
the ability of the Board to make a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with Section 4.02(c) and Section 4.02(d), use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit the approval of this Agreement by such shareholders (provided that for
the avoidance of doubt the making of a Change of Recommendation shall not
alter the obligations of the Company to call, give, notice of, convene and
hold the Company Shareholders Meeting or cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its shareholders pursuant to Section 5.01(a)) and (ii) in
accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules
issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a proposal to the shareholders
of the Company for a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain
compensation that may become payable to the Companys named executive officers
in connection with the completion of the Merger. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the shareholders of the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days) following the later of the effectiveness of the Form S-4 and
the No-Shop Period Start Date. Once established, the Company shall not change
the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or as required by applicable Law. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall make the Company Recommendation and shall
include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and the Board of
Directors of the Company and all committees thereof shall not (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any
manner adverse to Parent such recommendation, or (ii) make any other public
statement in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting contrary to
such recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) being
referred to herein as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 4.02(c) and Section 4.02(d).

(c) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior to
the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, including pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii), (i) the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting and to hold a vote of the
Companys shareholders on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger at the
Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by a Change of Recommendation, and
(ii) in any case in which the Company makes a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to Section 4.02, (A) the Company shall nevertheless submit
this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of its shareholders and (B) any proxy
card shall provide that signed proxies which do not specify the manner in
which the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto are to be voted shall
be voted "FOR" approving this Agreement).

(d) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall, in
its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement for
purposes of the Merger.

 



38 Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

 

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall afford (and
with respect to access as it relates to VMware and its Subsidiaries, use
commercially reasonable efforts to afford) to Parent, and to Parents
Representatives (including, to the extent requested by Parent in accordance
with Section 5.13(g), Parents Financing Sources), reasonable
access (including for the purpose of coordinating transition planning with
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior
to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to
the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel and records as Parent may from time to time reasonably request, and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly (and as it relates to
VMware and its Subsidiaries, use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish
promptly) to Parent and its Representatives (including, to the extent
requested by Parent in accordance with Section 5.13(g), Parents Financing
Sources) all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (other than, subject
to the requirements of Section 4.02, any such matters that relate to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or to transactions potentially
competing with or alternative to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or proposals from other parties relating to any competing
or alternative transactions). Nothing in this Section 5.02 shall require the
Company or its Subsidiaries to permit any inspection, provide any access or
disclose any information that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
would (A) unreasonably interfere with the Companys or its Subsidiaries
business operations or (B) result in the disclosure of any materials or
information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
any other applicable privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each of
clauses (A) and (B), the Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the effects of such restriction or to provide a reasonable
alternative to such access.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold, and shall cause their
respective Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to
hold, all information received from the other party, directly or indirectly,
in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject
to, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated October
28, 2014 between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the definition of "Representatives" in
Section 1 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to include any
potential debt or equity financing source of Parent or Merger Sub that are not
competitors of the Company or its Subsidiaries (it being understood that
notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives may disclose any
information to prospective debt and equity financing sources that are not
competitors of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
syndication and marketing of the Financing subject to receipt of customary
confidentiality undertakings from such prospective debt and equity financing
sources) and (ii) the third sentence of Section 1 of the Confidentiality
Agreement and the restrictions set forth in Section 9 of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be inapplicable with respect to any of the transactions set
forth in this Agreement or any proposals, negotiations or arrangements by or
on behalf of a party permitted by this Agreement (including in response to a
notice pursuant to Section 4.02(d)). The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant
to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein
shall be read to permit the disclosure of any information that is classified
pursuant to Executive Order 13526 or any similar or successor executive order
or regulation to any person except as would otherwise be permitted pursuant to
the regulations established by NISPOM or any similar regulation.

 

Section 5.03 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event on or prior to the
Outside Date, including preparing and filing or delivering as promptly as

 



39  practicable and advisable (with each party considering in good faith any
views or input provided by the other party with respect to the timing thereof)
all necessary or advisable filings, information updates, responses to
requests for additional information and other presentations required by or in
connection with seeking any regulatory approval, exemption, change of
ownership approval, or other authorization from, any Governmental Entity, or
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all consents, approvals, clearances,
authorizations, termination or expiration of waiting periods, non-actions,
waiver, Permits or orders, of or by any Governmental Entity, in each case that
are necessary or advisable in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (i) to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
and any other applicable Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date
hereof (with each party considering in good faith any views or input provided
by the other party with respect to the timing thereof), (ii) to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law and (iii) to use its reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods with
respect to the approval of the Merger under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.03(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party under applicable Antitrust Laws; (ii)
keep the other party reasonably informed of the status of matters related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the
other with any written notices or other communications received by such party
from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "),
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any
other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party under applicable
Antitrust Laws, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party under applicable Antitrust Laws, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences in
accordance with Antitrust Law. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "
_Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Foreign
Antitrust Laws and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition and (B) " _Foreign
Antitrust Laws_ " means the applicable requirements of antitrust competition
or other similar Laws, rules, regulations and judicial doctrines of
jurisdictions other than the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall determine strategy and timing, lead all
proceedings and coordinate all activities with respect to seeking any
actions, non-actions, terminations or expirations of waiting periods,
consents, approvals or waivers of any Governmental Entity or third party as
contemplated hereby, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take such actions as reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with obtaining any such actions, non-actions, terminations or
expirations of waiting periods, consents, approvals or waivers; _provided_ ,
that Parent and Merger Sub will consider in good faith any views or input
provided by the Company with respect to such matters.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 5.03(a) and Section 5.03(b), each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law, including using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or

 



40  administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed).

(d) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
on any basis whatsoever, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use
its respective reasonable best efforts to defend against, contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.03 shall limit (i) a partys right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(ii), in
accordance therewith or (ii) a partys right to take any action contemplated
by Section 4.02.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate, offer
and commit to make any divestitures, assign or hold separate any assets and
agree to any other remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or restriction
related to the conduct of their or the Companys and its Subsidiaries
business, to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity or
private party may assert under the Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to avoid the entry of any
Order or establishment of any Law preliminarily or permanently restraining,
enjoining or prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to enable the Closing to occur before the Outside Date (including, without
limitation, unless Parent otherwise agrees in its sole discretion that the
Marketing Period would otherwise commence notwithstanding that the conditions
to closing set forth in Section 6.01(c) (other than the Excluded Conditions)
are not satisfied, to enable the conditions to Closing set forth in Section
6.01(c) (other than the Excluded Conditions) to be satisfied before the date
that is thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Outside Date), unless such
action would, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse
(determined based on aggregate revenues) to Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting
the prior sentence, Parent shall not be required to agree to any amendment to,
or waiver under, this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall have the sole and
exclusive right to propose, negotiate, offer or commit to make or effect any
divestitures, to assign or hold separate any assets, or to agree to any other
remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or restriction related to the
conduct of their or the Companys and its Subsidiaries business in order to
resolve any Governmental Entitys or private partys objections to or concerns
about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall agree to make or effect any divestitures, assign or hold
separate any assets, or implement any other remedy, requirement, obligation,
condition or restriction on the conduct of its and its Subsidiaries business
(in each case solely to the extent implementation and effectiveness of such
actions are contingent upon the Closing) pursuant to this Section 5.03(f) to
resolve any Governmental Entitys or private partys objections to or concerns
about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent
instructed in writing by Parent or Merger Sub. For avoidance of doubt, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not make or effect any divestitures, assign
or hold separate any assets, or agree to or implement any other remedy,
requirement, obligation, condition or restriction on the conduct of its and
its Subsidiaries business pursuant to this Section 5.03(f), unless so
instructed in writing by Parent or Merger Sub in order to resolve any
Governmental Entitys or private partys objections to or concerns about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, enter
into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to effect any transaction
(including any merger or acquisition) that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or materially and adversely affect Parents ability to: (i)
obtain termination or

 



41  expiration of the applicable waiting period and all requisite clearances and
approvals under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as
practicable and in any event before the Outside Date; and (ii) avoid the
entry of the commencement of any action or proceeding seeking the entry of, or
effect the dissolution of, any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws.

 

(h) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to seek to obtain all material consents, approvals and waivers of
any third party under any Contract required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 5.03 will require a party to pay or agree to any fee,
penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent, approval or
waiver under any Contract required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.04 _Company Equity Awards_  . Other than with respect to equity and
equity-based awards described in Section 4.01(a)(x) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (which shall be treated in the manner described in the Company
Disclosure Letter), outstanding equity and equity-based awards of the Company
shall be treated as follows:

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
take all actions it determines to be necessary and appropriate to provide
that, each Company Stock Option shall become vested and fully exercisable for
a reasonable period of time prior to the Effective Time, provide written
notice to the holders of the Company Stock Options at least twenty (20) days
prior to the effective time of the period to exercise the Company Stock Option
and that such Company Stock Option will terminate and be of no further force
and effect as of the Effective Time. Except as may otherwise be agreed by and
between Parent and a holder of a Company Stock Option, each Company Stock
Option that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be automatically exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time on a net
exercise basis whereby (A) the full payment of the aggregate exercise price
for each such Company Stock Option is satisfied by the Company withholding
from the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise issuable to such holder of a
Company Stock Option, that number of shares of Company Common Stock having an
aggregate fair market value, determined based on the closing price of a share
of Company Common Stock on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time
(as such price is reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as reported
by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as Parent may determine))
(the " _Per Share Closing Price_ "), equal to the product of (x) the exercise
price for such Company Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, and (B) the applicable
Tax withholding obligation in respect of such Company Stock Option exercise
is satisfied by the Company withholding from the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise issuable to the holder of such Company Stock Options that
number of shares of Company Common Stock having an aggregate fair market
value, determined based on the Per Share Closing Price, equal to the amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Each such holder of a net exercised Company
Stock Option shall thereafter be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the net number of shares (including with respect to any
fractional shares of Company Common Stock) of Company Common Stock issued
upon such net exercise.

(b) _Company RSU Awards_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by and between
Parent and a holder of a Company RSU Award, each Company RSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time for the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award minus the number of shares of
Company Common Stock having an aggregate fair market value based on the Per
Share Closing Price, equal to the amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the vesting of such Company RSU Award. Each such holder of a
settled Company RSU Award shall thereafter be

 



42  entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the net number
of shares (including with respect to any fractional shares of Company Common
Stock) of Company Common Stock issued upon the vesting of the Company RSU
Awards.

(c) _Company PSU Awards_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by and between
Parent and a holder of a Company PSU Award, each Company PSU Award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time for the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award, determined based on the
target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company PSUs Awards
awarded to each holder thereof, minus the number of shares of Company Common
Stock having an aggregate fair market value based on the Per Share Closing
Price, equal to the amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
the vesting of such Company PSU Award. Each such holder of a settled Company
PSU Award shall thereafter be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the net number of shares (including with respect to any
fractional shares of Company Common Stock) of Company Common Stock issued upon
the vesting of the Company PSU Awards.

(d) _Company Restricted Stock_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by and
between Parent and a holder of a Company Restricted Stock, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of
Company Restricted Stock shall automatically become fully vested and the
restrictions thereon shall lapse, and each such share of Company Restricted
Stock shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

(e) _Dividend Equivalents_. Where holders of Company Restricted Stock,
Company RSU Awards or Company PSU Awards are entitled to dividends in respect
of such awards, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
such dividends corresponding to such awards shall vest and Parent shall pay
to the holders of such awards the cash amounts in respect of such dividends,
less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any other applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment,
within five calendar days following the Effective Time. For Company PSU
Awards, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to
which dividends shall be payable shall be determined in the manner set
forth in Section 5.04(c).

(f) _Management Equity Rollover_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives to allow, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards held by
certain employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to be contributed to
Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates in exchange for equity securities of
Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates, with the written agreement of
Parent and the holders of such Company Equity Awards.

(g) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall, prior to the Effective
Time, take all actions necessary to terminate the Company ESPP and all
outstanding rights thereunder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , that, from and after the date hereof, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that (i) no new offering periods under the
Company ESPP shall commence after the date hereof, (ii) no new participants be
permitted into the Company ESPP, and (iii) that the existing participants
thereunder may not increase their elections with respect to the offering
period then in effect. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any then
outstanding offering periods under the Company ESPP shall terminate and the
Company shall distribute to each Company ESPP participant all Company Common
Stock purchased pursuant to such offering period and all of his or her
remaining accumulated payroll deductions which are not used with respect to
such offering period.

 

Section 5.05 _Non-U.S. Employee Notifications_. Prior to Closing, the Company
agrees to take such reasonable steps as the Company, in good faith, considers
to be necessary in respect of applicable notice or

 



43  information and consultation requirements regarding any works council, labor
agreements and non-U.S. Law with respect to non-U.S. employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.06 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Subsidiary
to assume and honor the obligations with respect to all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of
expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its Subsidiaries) as
provided in the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws, the organizational
documents of the Companys Subsidiaries (other than VMwares Subsidiaries) or
any indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its Subsidiaries)
(in each case, as in effect on the date hereof), without further action, as of
the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms as of the
date hereof. For a period of six years following the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective
Time were current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its Subsidiaries).

(b) For a period of six years following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of
each of the Indemnified Parties) each current and former director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its
Subsidiaries) and each person who served, at the request of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its Subsidiaries), as a director,
officer, member, trustee, or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), to the same extent any such Indemnified Party would
have been entitled to be indemnified and held harmless (and been entitled to
advancement of funds) prior to the date of this Agreement under the Company
Articles or Company Bylaws or the organizational documents of the
Companys Subsidiaries (other than VMwares Subsidiaries), against any costs
or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_
") in connection with any actual or threatened Action arising out of, relating
to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether before or after the Effective Time in connection with such
Indemnified Partys service as a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its Subsidiaries) (including acts or
omissions in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as an officer,
director, member, trustee or other fiduciary in any other entity if such
services were at the request or for the benefit of the Company), including
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that any person to whom any funds are advanced pursuant to the
foregoing must, if required by Law, provide an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect the Companys and its Subsidiaries current
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(or such other insurance that is no less favorable to the current
beneficiaries thereof than the Companys and its Subsidiaries current
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys or its
Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance policies (complete and accurate copies of which have been
heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) the Company may substitute therefor a
single premium tail policy with respect to such directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with policy limits,

 



44  terms and conditions at least as favorable to the directors and officers
covered under such insurance policy as the limits, terms and conditions in the
existing policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries; or (ii) if the Company
does not substitute as provided in clause (i) above, then Parent may
substitute therefor policies of Parent, from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys and its Subsidiaries current
insurance carrier, containing terms with respect to coverage (including as
coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable
to such directors and officers; _provided_ , _further_ , that in connection
with this Section 5.06(c), neither the Company nor Parent shall pay a one-time
premium (in connection with a single premium tail policy described above) in
excess of 300% of the amount set forth in Section 5.06(c)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter or be obligated to pay annual premiums (in connection with
any other directors and officers insurance policy or fiduciary liability
insurance policy described above) in excess of the annual premiums set forth
in Section 5.06(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. It is understood and
agreed that if such coverage cannot be obtained for such amount or less, then
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of coverage as may
be obtained for such amount.

(d) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 5.06 if and to the extent that such
Indemnified Party is determined to be entitled to receive such
indemnification.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.06 (i) shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
from and after the Effective Time by, each indemnitee referred to above and
(ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties, rights and assets to any person, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.06.

Section 5.07 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude,
after consultation with its outside legal advisors, is required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in
which event such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement prior to making any such press release or
other announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as may be necessary
for the Company to comply with its obligations in Section 4.02, the Company
shall not be required to provide any such review or right to comment to Parent
in connection with the receipt and existence of an Acquisition Proposal and
matters related thereto or a Change of Recommendation, and Parent shall not
be required to provide any such review or right to comment to the Company in
connection with any response to an Acquisition Proposal or a Change of
Recommendation. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in
the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

Section 5.08  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall take appropriate action to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Class V Common Stock resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)

 



45  of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.09 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Class V Common Stock to be approved for listing upon the
Effective Time on the NYSE or NASDAQ, at the election of Parent, subject to
official notice of issuance, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide to Parent such assistance in connection with the
foregoing as Parent reasonably requests.

Section 5.10 _Transaction Litigation_. If any litigation related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is brought against the Company, any executive officers of the
Company or any members of the Board of Directors of the Company (in their
capacity as executive officers or as members of the Board of Directors of the
Company) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (the
" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any
such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
continuing basis with respect to the status thereof, including by facilitating
meetings between counsel of the Company and counsel of Parent and promptly and
diligently responding to reasonable inquiries with respect to any Transaction
Litigation made by Parent or its counsel. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to (i) participate in the defense of any Transaction Litigation
and (ii) consult with counsel to the Company regarding the
defense, settlement or compromise of any Transaction Litigation and consider
Parents views with respect to any Transaction Litigation, and the Company
shall not settle or compromise or agree to settle or compromise any
Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.11  _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent covenants and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, for the period commencing from the Closing Date and ending
no earlier than the first anniversary of the Closing Date provide to each
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues employment following
the Closing (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (i) annual base
salary or base wages, as applicable, and cash target incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding equity incentives), in each case, that are no less
favorable than such annual base salary or base wages, as applicable, and cash
target incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) severance compensation and
benefits to any Continuing Employee during the one (1) year period following
the Closing Date at levels that are no less favorable than the levels of such
severance compensation and benefits as in effect under the Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) defined contribution
retirement and health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to Continuing Employees under the Company
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under
the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
(the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall credit
each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company,
its Subsidiaries and any predecessor or other entities, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such service shall be credited to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries will cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to
the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) for the

 



46  plan year in which the Closing occurs, the crediting of each Continuing
Employee with any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid
prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable copayments,
deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Personnel any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 5.11 shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan
or Parent Plan, (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former
service provider or employee of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof), (iii)
alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or of their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time, or (iv) confer upon any current or former employee or
other service provider of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries, any right to employment or service or continued employment or
continued service with Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or constitute or create an employment or agreement with, or
modify the at-will status of, any employee or other service provider. 

Section 5.12 _Takeover Laws_. Each party and its Board of Directors shall (1)
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law (including
Chapters 110C, 110D and 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws) or similar Law
is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any state takeover Law
or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 5.13 _Financing_. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or cause to be obtained, the proceeds of the Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Commitment Papers (including, as necessary,
the "flex" provisions contained in any Fee Letter), including using its
reasonable best efforts with respect to (i) complying with and maintaining in
effect the Commitment Papers, including by complying with the "flex"
provisions contained in any Fee Letter in accordance with the terms thereof
and using reasonable best efforts to ensure the accuracy of
all representations and warranties and the compliance with all covenants and
agreements of Parent and its Subsidiaries under the Commitment Papers, (ii)
negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements (and thereafter
and until the Effective Time complying with and maintaining in effect such
definitive agreements) with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive
Agreements_ ") (draft and executed copies of definitive credit agreements,
indentures and/or purchase agreements and material ancillary documents shall
be provided to the Company as promptly as practicable following reasonable
request therefor) consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in any Fee Letter) or, if available, on other terms that (A) are
acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion, (B) would not reasonably be
expected to delay (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period) or adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (C) would otherwise be permitted by
Section 5.13(b)(ii), and (iii) taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period, satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the
Financing that are within the control of Parent and its Subsidiaries and by
paying when due any fees or deposits required by the Commitment Papers or any
Fee Letter. If all of the respective conditions contained in any of the
Commitment Papers have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied) or
waived, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to timely (A) cause the
Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter to fully fund the
Financing provided for thereunder and (B) fully enforce its rights (including
through litigation) under such Commitment Papers (and in the case of the Debt
Financing under any Definitive Agreements) in the event of breach or
threatened breach by the Financing Sources, including by seeking specific
performance of the parties obligations thereunder, in each case, to the
extent required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at the Closing.

 



47  Without limiting this Section 5.13(a), Parent acknowledges and agrees that
it shall be fully responsible for obtaining the Common Equity Financing and
shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done)
all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the Common
Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing, including (1) satisfying on a
timely basis all conditions to the obligations of the Financing Sources under
the Common Equity Purchase Agreements to consummate the Common Equity

in the event any net proceeds are received by Parent under the Common Equity
Purchase Agreements in advance of the Closing, holding and maintaining such
funds for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the Closing.

 

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, (i)
terminate or permit the termination, withdrawal, repudiation or rescission
of, or release the obligations of any Financing Sources under, any of the
Commitment Papers or Definitive Agreements (other than in the case of the Debt
Financing either (x) a reduction of commitments in respect of the
facilities in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds received by Parent or
any of its domestic subsidiaries from the issuance of debt securities or
incurrence of loans in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter
or (y) a Financing Reduction Exception), unless such Commitment Paper or
Definitive Agreement is replaced at such time with a new commitment letter or
credit agreement that, were it structured as an amendment to such Commitment
Paper or Definitive Agreement, would satisfy the following clause (ii), or
(ii) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
or remedy under, or replace, any of the Commitment Papers or Definitive
Agreements if such amendment, modification, waiver, or replacement (w)
adversely impacts in any material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against the Financing Sources party to such Commitment Papers or
Definitive Agreements, (x) would (1) add any new condition to the Financing
(or modify any existing condition in a manner adverse to Parent) or otherwise
be reasonably expected to materially delay or adversely affect (including with
respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period, reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent
or make less likely the timely funding in full of any of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the Financing, (y) reduces
(or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate
amount of the Financing provided for under such Commitment Papers or
Definitive Agreements (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid in
respect of the Debt Financing or original issue discount in respect of the
Debt Financing) unless, in the case of a reduction in the amount of the Debt
Financing, the transactions contemplated hereby could still be consummated and
all of Parents obligations hereunder satisfied through the aggregate net
proceeds of the Common Equity Financing, any remaining portion of the
Debt Financing and any debt financing under any new debt commitment letter
that, were it structured as an amendment to the Debt Commitment Letter, would
otherwise satisfy this clause (ii), together with the Parent Cash on Hand to
be made available by Parent at the Effective Time and the Target Amount of
Cash on Hand to be made available by the Company at the Effective Time (this
clause (y), the " _Financing Reduction Exception_ "), or (z) taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent
may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add Financing Sources, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company, (A) terminate or permit the termination, withdrawal, repudiation
or rescission of, or release the obligations of any Financing Sources under,
the Common Equity Purchase Agreements or (B) permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace,
the Common Equity Purchase Agreements. Upon any such amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement of the Debt Financing or the Common Equity Financing in
accordance with this Section 5.13(b), the term "Debt Financing," or "Common
Equity Financing" shall mean the Debt Financing or Common Equity Financing, as
the case may be, as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced,
and the terms "Debt Commitment Letter," "Definitive Agreements," and "Common
Equity Purchase Agreements" shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Definitive Agreements, and the Common Equity Purchase Agreements, as the case
may be, as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced.

 



48 (c) If any portion of the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall (i) as promptly as
practicable after obtaining Knowledge that such portion has become or is
reasonably expected to become unavailable, notify the Company of such
unavailability and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the reason therefor and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event and in any event no later than the
last day of the Marketing Period, alternative financing (in an amount
sufficient to enable the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated)
from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions that are not less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent than such unavailable Debt Financing
(including the "flex" provisions contained in any Fee Letter) pursuant to
commitment letters (or other agreements) (complete and correct executed copies
of which shall be promptly provided to the Company; _provided_ , that any Fee
Letter (or similar confidential letter) may be redacted in a customary manner
solely with respect to fee amounts, yield and interest caps, original issue
discount amounts and "flex" and "securities demand" terms and other similar
economic terms that are confidential and do not adversely affect the
enforceability, availability or conditionality of or the aggregate amount of
net proceeds available under the Debt Financing). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no such alternative financing may expand upon the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing
Date as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof
or otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that would
reasonably be expected to make the funding of such alternative financing less
likely to occur. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing" and "Fee Letter" shall be deemed
to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment or any
fee letter referred to in such commitment letter with respect to
any alternative financing arranged in compliance with this Section 5.13(c)
(and any Debt Commitment Letter, Debt Financing and Fee Letter remaining in
effect at the time in question).

 

(d) If any portion of the aggregate amount of the Common Equity Financing
becomes unavailable (or is reasonably expected to become unavailable) on the
terms and conditions set forth in the respective Common Equity Purchase
Agreements, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall (i) as promptly as
practicable after obtaining Knowledge thereof, notify the Company of
such unavailability and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the reason therefor and
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event and in any event no later than the last
day of the Marketing Period, alternative common equity financing (in an
amount sufficient to enable the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated) from, pursuant to commitment letters (or similar agreements) with
(complete and correct executed copies of which shall be promptly provided to
the Company), the same or other sources and on terms and conditions that are
not less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than such unavailable Common
Equity Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such alternative
financing may expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding of the Common Equity Financing, as applicable, on the Closing Date as
set forth in the respective Common Equity Purchase Agreements, in each case,
in effect on the date hereof or otherwise include terms that would reasonably
be expected to make the funding of such alternative financing less likely to
occur. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Common Equity
Purchase Agreements" and "Common Equity Financing", shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment or any fee
letter referred to in such commitment letter with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance with this Section 5.13(d) (and any Common
Equity Purchase Agreements and Common Equity Financing, as applicable,
remaining in effect at the time in question).

 

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent shall not be required to
consummate the Debt Financing until the final day of the Marketing Period.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing (including
any alternative financing) or any portion thereof is not a condition to the
Closing.

 

(f) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice (i)
of (x) any breach or default (or threatened breach or default or event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default) by any party to any of the Commitment Papers or the
Definitive Agreements of which Parent has Knowledge or any actual or
threatened termination, withdrawal, repudiation or rescission of any of the
Commitment Papers or the Definitive Agreements or (y) any dispute or
disagreement between or

 



49  among Parent, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources under the Financing
on the other hand, with respect to the obligation to fund any of the Financing
or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing (but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the
terms of the Financing), and (ii) if at any time for any reason Parent
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the aggregate amount of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Papers or the
Definitive Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent
be under any obligation to disclose any information shared among Parent and
its professional advisors in connection with matters contemplated by clause
(x) or (y) that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a
way that would not waive such privilege. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing (or any alternative financing).

Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation

good faith to establish a mechanism reasonably acceptable to both parties by

Section 5.15 _Liquidation of Investments; Cash Transfers_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, subject to compliance with applicable Law by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company shall, and shall cause its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries to (i) sell for cash, with effect as of a date
reasonably proximate to the Closing Date, marketable securities (other than
shares of VMware Common Stock) and cash equivalents held by, or on behalf of
or for the benefit of, the Company and/or any of such Subsidiaries (the "
_Investments Liquidation_ "), and (ii) transfer from such Subsidiaries
(whether through loans, loan repayments, dividends, distributions or other
transfers to the Company or other such Subsidiaries), prior to the Effective
Time, an amount of Available Cash to the Company (the " _Cash Transfers_ "),
such that the Company shall (A) make available at the Effective Time no less
than the Target Amount of Cash on Hand (giving effect to any reduction
pursuant to Section 5.15(c)) and (B) use reasonable efforts to make available
at the Effective Time any additional Available Cash that exceeds the Target
Amount of Cash on Hand to the extent a specific amount of Available Cash in
excess of the Target Amount of Cash on Hand is requested in writing by Parent
at least fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated expiration of the
Marketing Period. The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
keep Parent and its Representatives reasonably informed regarding the planning
and status of the Cash Transfers and consult with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith in advance on the method of completing the Cash
Transfers. The Company agrees that, at the Closing, the Company shall make
available to

 



53  finance the cash payments to be made on the Closing Date in accordance with
this Agreement, no less than the Target Amount of Cash on Hand (giving effect
to any reduction pursuant to Section 5.15(c)) and shall use reasonable
efforts to make available any additional Available Cash pursuant to clause (B)
above.

 

(b) The Company shall not make Cash Transfers from Subsidiaries located
outside of the United States if such Cash Transfers would be reasonably
likely to result in any Tax becoming payable with respect to such Cash
Transfers, unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such
Cash Transfers (or, if applicable, any strategic plan preapproved by Parent in
writing under which such Cash Transfers will be effected, which strategic
plan contemplates such Taxes becoming payable); provided, that if any Cash
Transfers with respect to which Parent withheld its consent pursuant to this
sentence are necessary to permit the Company to make available at the
Effective Time no less than the Target Amount of Cash on Hand (giving effect
to any reduction pursuant to Section 5.15(c)), then Parent and the Company
shall cooperate in good faith to find an alternative structure to effect such
Cash Transfers (including through loans to Subsidiaries of Parent, as
designated by Parent, made concurrently with the Closing on the Closing Date)
and if no such alternative is agreed after such cooperation, upon the tenth
(10th) day prior to the anticipated expiration of the Marketing Period, Parent
shall automatically be deemed to have consented to any such Cash Transfers
solely to the extent necessary to permit the Company to make available at the
Effective Time no less than the Target Amount of Cash on Hand (giving effect
to any reduction pursuant to Section 5.15(c)). It is understood and agreed
that any Taxes payable with respect to Cash Transfers required by this
Section 5.15 shall be the responsibility of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiaries following the Closing and shall not reduce Available Cash for
purposes of determining whether the Company has made available the Target
Amount of Cash on Hand.

(c) As promptly as practicable prior to the Closing (but not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), if Parent determines that
the amount of Cash on Hand necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to occur on the Closing Date is less than the
Target Amount, Parent may, in its sole discretion, elect to irrevocably
notify the Company in writing (which notification shall include a schedule of
estimated sources and uses of cash on the Closing Date in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of a decrease in the Target
Amount of Cash on Hand that the Company is required to make available at the
Effective Time and if such notice identifies the Subsidiaries of the Company
that will continue to retain cash that would otherwise have been the subject
of a Cash Transfer but for the notice delivered pursuant to this Section
5.15(c), such cash shall be retained at such Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the condition set forth
in Section 6.02(b), as it applies to the obligations under this Section 5.15,
shall be deemed satisfied if the Company makes available at the Effective Time
no less than the Target Amount of Cash on Hand and has complied in good faith
using all reasonable efforts with respect to all other obligations under this
Section 5.15.

(d) The Company shall confirm in writing to Parent and provide reasonable
supporting evidence of the amount of Cash on Hand as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall (i) not be obligated to initiate or effect any
Cash Transfers or Investments Liquidation until on or after the date that is
fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated expiration of the Marketing Period
and (ii) have no obligation to initiate or effect any Cash Transfers
or Investments Liquidation under this Section 5.15 unless and until Parent
has delivered a written notice meeting the requirements of Section 5.13(j)
with respect to the Parent Cash on Hand, together with any updates thereto to
the extent required under Section 5.13(j).

(e) For the purposes of this Section 5.15:

 

(i) " _Available Cash_ " means cash that is unrestricted under applicable Law)
and that (prior to the Cash Transfers, but after giving effect to the
Investments Liquidation) is held by one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
the Company that, in the aggregate, exceeds One Billion Dollars
($1,000,000,000).

 



54 (ii) " _Cash on Hand_ " means cash held in one or more bank

(A) Four Billion Seven Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($4,750,000,000);

 

(B) _plus_ , the aggregate amount of any indebtedness for borrowed money of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than VMware and its Subsidiaries)
incurred between September 30, 2015 and the Closing Date (for avoidance of
doubt, excluding (A) any such indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding
between (i) the Company and any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or

following the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable best efforts, to take or
cause to be taken any action necessary for the Merger to qualify as an
exchange described in Section 351 of the Code (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_
"), including (i) reasonably refraining from any action that such party knows,
or is reasonably expected to know, is reasonably likely to prevent the
Intended Tax Treatment, (ii) executing such amendments to this Agreement as

affect the value of the Merger to such party or its shareholders), and (iii)
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in
Section 6.02(d) and Section 6.03(c), and any tax opinions required to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the filing of the Form S-4, including by
executing customary letters of representation. In the event the parties are
not able to obtain such tax opinions, solely to the extent necessary to
obtain the opinions referred to in Section 6.02(d) and Section 6.03(c),
Parent and the Company shall modify the structure of the transaction such that
a new holding corporation is formed to acquire both Parent and Company in a
transaction described in Section 351 of the Code, which modification to the
structure of the

 



56  transaction shall preserve to the greatest extent possible the economic
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall work
together in good faith to promptly implement such modification. Each of
Parent and the Company shall report the Merger, taken together with related
transactions (or, if the structure of the transaction is modified pursuant to
Section 5.21(a), such modified transaction, taken together with related
transactions), as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and shall
not take any position inconsistent with such treatment unless otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code.

(b) After the date of this Agreement, Parent shall cooperate with the Company
in good faith to deliver to the Company a copy of the proposed form of the
Parent Tax Opinion together with all letters or certificates that form the
basis therefor (collectively, the " _Parent Tax Opinion Materials_ "). The

furnish the Company with a copy of the final Parent Tax Opinion Materials.

 

(c) After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall cooperate with Parent

discussions between VMware and Parent as to an amendment to the Tax Sharing
Agreement dated August 13, 2007 between the Company, VMware and the other
parties thereto (the " _Tax Sharing Agreement_ "), whereby Parent and its
Subsidiaries will become parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement effective as of
the Closing Date and which amendment will reflect that the Company and its
Subsidiaries will become members of one or more combined, consolidated or
affiliated tax groups, the common parent of which is Parent.

 

Section 5.22 _Headquarters_. As of and for at least ten (10) years following
the Effective Time, the global headquarters for the combined enterprise
systems business of Parent and the Company shall be located in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

 

Section 5.23 _Independent Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time,
representatives of Parent shall consult with the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Company concerning the three (3) persons to serve on the
Board of Directors of Parent following the Effective Time who satisfy the
independence requirements of a company listed on the national securities
exchange on which the Class V Stock will be listed (the " _Parent Independent
Director_ s"). After such consultation and after being provided with the list
of three (3) persons who Parent desires to serve as the Parent Independent
Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company may within
two (2) Business Days after receiving such list deliver a written notice to
Parent that he desires one (but not more than one) of such persons to be taken
out of consideration for election as a Parent Independent Director. If such a
notice is properly delivered, Parent will not designate such person to be
elected as a Parent Independent Director and will instead determine in its
sole discretion, but after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Company, the person who will serve as the third Parent
Independent Director. Parent shall take such actions as are necessary to cause
the three (3) persons selected in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 5.23 to be elected to the Board of Directors of Parent as of the
Effective Time.

(regardless of whether such Acquisition Proposal is (x) made before or
after termination of this Agreement or (y) is the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (i) above), then (subject to the aggregate limitation
set forth in the proviso to Section 7.02), the Company shall pay to Parent (or
its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds,
on the date of the first to occur of such event(s) referred to above in this

62  to "or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company" and "or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries" shall be deemed to refer only to VMware, subject to
Section 7.03(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company (x) pursuant to Section

to a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.02(g)
or Section 3.02(h), (y) pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(iii) or (z) by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) in circumstances in which the Company would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i)
due to a breach of covenants by Parent, Dell or Merger Sub or due to a breach
of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.02(g) or Section
3.02(h), then Parent or Dell shall pay to the Company a fee in the amount
equal to Four Billion Dollars ($4,000,000,000) (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(iii) and at such time
(1) the Company has made available the Target Amount of Cash on Hand and has
otherwise complied with its obligations under Section 5.15 and (2) the
Financing Sources for the Debt Financing have confirmed that the Debt
Financing will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
(assuming the substantially concurrent funding of the Common Equity
Financing, the Target Amount of Cash on Hand and the Parent Cash on Hand), and
(3) Parent and Dell do not make available the Parent Cash on Hand for the
purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
Dell shall pay to the Company, in lieu of the Reverse Termination Fee (and
without duplication), a fee in the amount equal to Six Billion Dollars
($6,000,000,000) (the " _Alternative Reverse Termination Fee_ "). The Reverse
Termination Fee or the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable,
shall be paid by Parent or Dell by wire transfer of same-day funds no later
than the second Business Day following the date of such termination of this
Agreement. 

(f) Without limiting or otherwise affecting other remedies that may be
available to Parent and Merger Sub, in the event of the termination of this
Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i), then the Company shall pay to, or as
directed by, Parent as promptly as possible (but in any event within two
Business Days) following receipt of an invoice therefor all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment banks, advisors and consultants to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates, and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Financing
Sources for which Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates may be responsible)
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, up to an
aggregate maximum amount of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), by wire
transfer of same day funds, which amount shall be credited against any Company
Termination Fee that becomes subsequently payable to Parent.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent and
Merger Sub fail to effect the Closing when required by Section 1.02 for any
or no reason or otherwise breach this Agreement (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or fail to perform hereunder
(whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then (i)
(x) a decree or order of specific performance or an injunction or injunctions
if and to the extent permitted by Section 8.09, (y) the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i), Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section
7.01(d)(iii) and receipt of payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or the
Alternative Reverse Termination Fee (as applicable) pursuant to Section
7.03(e), if payable in accordance with the terms hereof and (z) the Companys
rights against Parent and Dell in respect of the Dell Obligations, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) of the Company and its Affiliates against any of Parent,
Merger Sub, Dell, the stockholders of Parent, the Financing Sources and any
of their respective former, current or future direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited
partners, attorneys or other representatives, or any of their respective
successors or assigns or any of the former, current or future direct or
indirect equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners, attorneys or other representatives or successors
or assignees of any of the foregoing (each a " _Specified Person_ " and
together, the " _Specified Persons_ ") for any breach, cost, expense, loss or
damage suffered as a result thereof, and (ii) except with respect to Parent,
Merger Sub and Dell as provided in the immediately foregoing clause (i), none
of the Specified

 



63  Persons will have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Papers
or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Without limiting the right of Parent and Merger Sub (or following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) under the Commitment Papers or the
Companys rights as a third party beneficiary of Parents rights under the
Common Equity Purchase Agreements to cause Parent to obtain the proceeds of
and consummate the Common Equity Financing if and to the extent permitted
thereunder and by Section 8.09, the Company acknowledges and agrees that none
of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company
or any of its Affiliates if they breach or fail to perform (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) any of their
obligations under their respective Commitment Papers. Without limiting clause
(ii) above or the Companys rights set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or the Alternative
Reverse Termination Fee (as applicable) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, none of the Specified Persons shall have any further liability to
the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Commitment Papers or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Specified Persons shall have
any further liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case, other than liability of Dell in respect of the Dell Obligations.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be deemed to be in breach
of this Agreement or to have failed to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement, including for purposes of Section 7.01(b)(i), solely as a
result of the inability (in and of itself) of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date the
Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.02 due to the
proceeds of the Debt Financing not being available in full pursuant to the
terms thereof, if neither Parent nor Merger Sub has otherwise breached or
failed to perform its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not limit
the Companys rights to seek specific performance or injunctive relief to the
extent otherwise permitted under Section 8.09.

(h) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would enter into this Agreement; accordingly if either
the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company
or Parent, as applicable, for the Company Termination Fee, Reverse Termination
Fee or the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, or Dell shall pay to the Company,
as applicable, its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount due pursuant to this Section 7.03 from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. All payments under this Section 7.03 shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent or Company. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event will the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion and in no event will Dell be required to pay both the
Reverse Termination Fee and the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee or to pay
either such fee on more than one occasion.

 

Section 7.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there
shall be made no amendment that by applicable Law requires further approval by
the shareholders of the Company without such approval having been obtained.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Section 7.03(g), this Section 7.04, Section 8.06, Section
8.07, Section 8.09 and Section 8.10 may not be modified, waived or terminated
in a manner adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources or their Specified
Persons without the prior written consent of the relevant Financing Source.

 



64 Section 7.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

 

Section 7.06 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A party terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 (other than pursuant to Section
7.01(a)) shall deliver a written notice to the other party setting forth the
specific basis for such termination and the specific provision of Section 7.01
pursuant to which this Agreement is being terminated. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.04 or Section 7.05 shall, in order to be effective,
require, in the case of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub, action by its
Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.

relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation

product of negotiation by the parties having the assistance of counsel and

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written

their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 



73 Section 8.09 _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 8.09(b), the parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 8.09(b), the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy) and agrees not to assert and hereby
waives any defense to the effect that a remedy of injunctive relief or
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid or contrary to Law or that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
which other remedies are subject to Section 7.03(g). The parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that the Companys entitlement to specific performance
under this Section 8.09(a) in respect of Parents obligations to have and
maintain the Parent Cash on Hand as required by Section 5.13(j) shall not be
subject to the conditions set forth in Section 8.09(b).

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance and any other injunctive relief in order to
cause Parent to cause the full funding of the Common Equity Financing under
the Common Equity Purchase Agreements and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur at the Closing, if and only if:

 

(i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.01 and Section
6.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing, but subject to those
conditions being capable of being satisfied at such time if specific
performance was granted pursuant to this Section 8.09(b)) at the time when
the Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02;

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing following the
date the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02;

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or the Financing Sources for the
Debt Financing have confirmed that the Debt Financing will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing; and

 

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that it is
ready, willing and able for the Closing to occur if specific performance is
granted and that if the Debt Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur
(provided that such irrevocable notice may remain subject to the continued
satisfaction as of the Closing of the conditions set forth in Section
6.01(b), Section 6.03(a) (solely as such condition relates to the
representations set forth in Section 3.02(h), Section 6.01(d) and Section
6.03(d)) and Section 6.03(b) (solely as such condition relates to
the obligations under Section 5.19).

For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that (A) in no event
shall the Company be entitled to the remedies set forth in this Section
8.09(b) if the conditions set forth under clauses (i) through (iv) above are
not satisfied and (B) the election of the Company to pursue a grant of
specific performance and any other injunctive relief to the extent permitted
by this Section 8.09(b) with respect to the matters set forth in this Section
8.09(b) shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from seeking
to terminate this Agreement and collect payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee or the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee (as applicable) pursuant to
Section 7.03(e); _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances shall
the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific
performance to require Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Closing and (B)
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or the Alternative Reverse Termination
Fee (as applicable).

 



74 (c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding brought by any party to this Agreement with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by another party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts for Suffolk County, Massachusetts (or if such court does
not have jurisdiction, any state court located within the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, or if those courts do not have jurisdiction, then any federal
court of the United States located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
or proceeding brought by any party to this Agreement with respect to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this Section 8.09(c), (ii) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) such suit, action
or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice
in accordance with Section 8.02.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting Section 8.09(c), each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources for the Debt Financing or
their Specified Persons in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any other letter or agreement related to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than any state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, claims and actions that may be based upon, arise out of, or
relate to, the Debt Financing or involve the Financing Sources for the Debt
Financing or their Specified Persons (whether in law, contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that (i) the
interpretation of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" (and whether or
not a Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (ii) the determination of the
accuracy of any Specified Acquisition Agreement Representation (as defined in
the Debt Commitment Letter) and whether as a result of any inaccuracy thereof
Parent or Merger Sub have the right (taking into account any applicable cure
provisions) to terminate its obligations under this Agreement or decline to
consummate the Merger and (iii) the determination of whether the Merger has
been consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 8.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO

 



75  ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.10.

Section 8.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remainder of such term or
provision or the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable; _provided_ , that the parties intend that the remedies and
limitations thereon (including the limitations on liability contained in
Section 7.02 and provisions that, subject to the terms and limitations set
forth in Section 8.09(b), payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or
the Alternative Reverse Termination Fee (as applicable) be the exclusive
remedy for the recipient thereof and the limitation on liabilities of the
Specified Persons) contained in Article VII and Section 8.09 to be construed
as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a partys
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing.
