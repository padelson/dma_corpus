otherwise modified or waived in any respect, (ii)&nbsp;the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Papers have not been terminated, withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded in any respect and no such amendment, restatement,
modification, waiver, withdrawal, repudiation or rescission is contemplated (other than any such amendment, restatement or modification to add Financing Sources, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof), and (iii)&nbsp;except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Papers, there are no side letters or Contracts or understandings related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing (or any portion thereof). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Papers are in full force and effect and constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of each of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the funding of the full

indebtedness required by the Debt Commitment Letter, and the payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, and required to be paid on or prior to the date of
the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;6.01 and Section&nbsp;6.02, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which would constitute a breach or default (or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Commitment Papers, under the Commitment Papers or would otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing not being available. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;6.01 and Section&nbsp;6.02, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a
timely basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by it or its Subsidiaries contained in the Commitment Papers or that the full amounts committed pursuant to each of the Commitment Papers will not be available on or before the date of the Closing.
