satisfactory to Buyer, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer
(including providing and executing any documents or affidavits reasonably

specific description of each event or circumstance and the Asset affected
thereby, including the underlying facts. Promptly after Buyers delivery of
such a notice, the Parties will meet and agree on the appropriate repair,
resolution, replacement or remediation for the identified issue and Seller
will complete the repair, resolution, replacement or remediation prior to
Closing. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the foregoing, the
Buyer may treat the same as a failure of a condition to its obligation to
close, as the Buyers sole remedy for any breach of the covenant in this
_Section 5.8_, and if Buyer exercises its right to refuse to close the
transactions contemplated herein due to such failure of the condition to
Buyers obligation to close, Buyer will not be entitled to make any claim for
breach of a representation or warranty by Seller with respect to such issue.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall repair, resolve, replace or
remediate issues of which Buyer has notified Seller pursuant to the first

_Section 8.5_ prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date. Precious
Lady shall not, and shall cause its members not to, prior to the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date, allow or cause Precious Lady to undergo a
change of control (using the definition of "control" set forth in the

complete and fully equip each well and construct and install each facility set
forth on _Schedule 5.12_ at Sellers cost and place the same into commercial
operation by the applicable completion date set forth on _Schedule 5.12_ for
such well or facility, in each case to Buyers reasonable satisfaction. There
are certain projects and facilities which do not appear on _Schedule 5.12_ ,
which may be completed by the Buyer, in its sole discretion, but without
obligation on the part of the Seller to contribute or pay for the same.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** _ 
TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

 **Section 6.1** **_Transfer Taxes_**. Seller shall be responsible for
payment of all transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar
Taxes, if any, resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer and Seller shall use Reasonable
Efforts to cooperate with each other to minimize such Taxes.

 



 

 **Section 6.2** **_Purchase Price Allocation_**. The Parties agree that for
federal income tax purposes (and applicable state and local tax purposes) the
acquisition of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as in
part an acquisition of an undivided interest in each of the Assets by NGL in a
transaction governed by Section 721 of the Code and in part an acquisition of
an undivided interest in each of the Assets by NGL in a transaction governed
by Section 1001 of the Code, as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.707-3 et. seq. For this purpose, each NGL Common Unit, if
applicable, shall be valued at $16.00 and each NGL Preferred Unit shall be
valued at the NGL Preferred Unit Price. The Parties agree that the Purchase
Price (plus any Assumed Obligations that constitute assumed liabilities for
federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated (including, but not limited
to, for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code) in the manner set forth on
_Schedule 6.2_ , which schedule will be provided and agreed upon by June 15,
2019. The Parties each agree to report (and cause their Affiliates to report)
the federal, state and local income and other Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated herein, and in particular to report the information
required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to prepare and file all Tax
Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594), in a manner consistent
with this _Section 6.2_ and _Schedule 6.2_, and shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any such Tax Return, in any refund
claim, in any litigation, investigation or otherwise unless required to do so
by Law. Seller and Buyer shall confer and cooperate in good faith on any
revisions to the allocation of the Purchase Price, including reporting any
matters that require updating (including adjustments to the Purchase Price),
to be consistent with the agreed allocation.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 6.3** **_Tax Cooperation_**. Each of Buyer and Seller will provide
such information and records and make such of its Representatives available as
may reasonably be requested by Buyer or Seller in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other proceeding that relates to
the Assets. Seller shall provide any information necessary or reasonably
requested to allow Buyer to comply with any information reporting or
withholding requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws or to
compute the amount of payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to
any payment made in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.4** **_Property Tax Allocation_**. With respect to any real
property, personal property, _ad valorem_ and other similar Tax (" _Property
Taxes_ "), assessed on any of the Assets for any period that begins before and
ends after the Effective Time (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the liability for
such Property Tax shall be prorated on a daily basis between Buyer and Seller
as of the Effective Time, with (a) Seller being liable for the portion of such
Property Taxes equal to the product of (i) the amount of such Property Taxes
for the entirety of the Straddle Period, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the
day prior to the day that includes the Effective Time and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period, and (b) Buyer being
liable for the remainder of such Property Taxes. Buyer shall receive a credit,
at Closing, against the Purchase Price to the extent of Sellers portion of
such prorated Property Taxes. Buyer shall thereafter pay or cause to be paid,
when due, to the appropriate Tax Authority, all Property Taxes for the
Straddle Period. If the Closing Date shall occur before the applicable Tax
rate or assessment is fixed for such Straddle Period, the apportionment of
such Property Taxes and payments at the Closing shall be based upon the most
recently ascertainable Property Tax bills, and the Parties shall work together
in good faith to promptly "true-up" the Property Taxes assessed during the
current year after such Property Tax bills become available.

 **Section 8.1** **_Survival_**. The representations and warranties of the
Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive for a period of twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , _Section 3.1_,
_Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3(b)_, _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.10_, _Section
3.12_, _Section 3.13_, _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3(b)_ and
_Section 4.7_ shall each survive indefinitely and _Section 3.9_ shall
survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, without regard to the application of any applicable discovery
rules. Covenants and agreements of the Parties shall survive until performed.
Neither Party shall have any liability for indemnification claims made under
this _Article VIII_ with respect to any such representation or warranty
unless a written notice of claim (describing in reasonable detail the claim,
including an estimate of Losses attributable to such claim to the extent then
known or reasonably capable of being calculated) is provided by Buyer to
Seller or by Seller to Buyer, as applicable, prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period for such representation or warranty. If a written
notice of claim has been timely given in accordance with this Agreement prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty, then the applicable representation or warranty shall survive as to
such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



 

 **Section 8.2** **_Indemnification_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, Buyers Affiliates
and their respective Representatives (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against all Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties incur arising
from:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement;

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) any breach by Seller of any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the Retained Obligations.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article VIII_, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to make indemnity claims under this
_Article VIII_ against Disposals and not Mesquite and Mesquite shall not be
liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which Buyer is
entitled to indemnity hereunder. Following Closing, Mesquite will be obligated
to continue performing the covenants that Mesquite is required to perform
under this Agreement, but will have no further liability to Buyer under this
Agreement and any claims by Buyer for Mesquites breach of such covenants
(other than _Section 5.4_) will be limited to the specific performance remedy
set forth in _Section 8.8(b)_ and any indemnity claims against Disposals to
which Buyer is entitled under this _Article VIII_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_, from and after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, Sellers Affiliates
and their respective Representatives (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against all Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties incur arising
from (i) the Assumed Obligations, to the extent such Losses are not subject to
the provisions of _Section 8.2(a)_ and are not the subject of a Claim Notice
delivered by Buyer by the date specified in _Section 8.1_, and (ii) any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Buyer in this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a
duty to use Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss (which duty shall include
the obligation to seek and collect available insurance proceeds and
indemnification and reimbursement payments) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) For purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty has been
breached for purposes of this _Article VIII_ and determining the amount of
Losses suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, each representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement,
and any qualification with respect to any representation or warranty set forth
in any Disclosure Schedule, shall be read without regard for or giving effect
to "material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar
qualification. A Partys Knowledge prior to the Closing of any breach or
failure of any representation or warranty made by the other Party herein shall
be a bar to the first Partys right to indemnification hereunder for such
breach or failure, except to the extent such Party notified the other Party of
such breach or failure prior to Closing, in which case such Partys knowledge
at any time will not affect its right to indemnification hereunder. A Partys
knowledge of any other matter or knowledge that first comes to a Party after
the Closing will not affect that Partys right to indemnification hereunder.
Each of the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Party asserting that the
other Party had Knowledge prior to Closing of any breach or failure of any
representation or warranty by such asserting Party (or any other Party other
than the Party alleged to have Knowledge of such breach or failure) shall have
the burden of proof in establishing such Knowledge.

 



 

 **Section 8.3** **_Indemnification Procedures_**. Claims for indemnification
under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



     

 

 



 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect
to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a non-Affiliate third
party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section 8.2_ shall promptly (i) notify the other Party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and (ii) transmit to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys best
estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party Claim and the
basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this
Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the
right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of
the Third Party Claim (such election to be without prejudice to the right of
the Indemnifying Party to dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable Loss
under this _Article VIII_), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to defend such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all
appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 8.3(b)_. The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further_ , that such
consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the
claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim, (ii) the settlement
agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any
business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and (iii) the settlement
agreement is not with respect to any Third Party Claim asserted by a Tax
Authority. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of
any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or
any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_, and
the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be
reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified
Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the
Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend
any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of

 



     

 

 



 

such defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying
Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

 



 

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, a claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought.

 



 

(e) In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a
claim of indemnification under this _Article VIII_, no other Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for
indemnification.

 



 

 **Section 8.4** **_Limitations on Liability of Seller_**. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Seller be obligated for
Losses under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement if the aggregate amount
of Losses suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties (a) does not
exceed two million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ ") or (b) exceeds
ten (10%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "). The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the intent of the preceding sentence, and this Agreement, is that
all liability and responsibility for (i) Losses below the Deductible and (ii)
Losses exceeding the Cap with respect to breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement shall be borne by Buyer. The limitations
in this _Section 8.4_ shall not apply to breaches or failures of _Section
3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3(b)_, _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.9_, or
_Section 3.13_.

 



 

 **Section 8.5** **_Remedies_**. If any finally resolved claim for
indemnification by Seller under _Section 8.1_ is not satisfied by payment by
Seller or Precious Lady in immediately available funds within 20 Business Days
after it is finally resolved, Buyer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to satisfy any such finally resolved claims by causing NGL to
cancel a number of the NGL Preferred Units issued by NGL to Precious Lady
hereunder equal to the number of NGL Preferred Units required so that the sum
of the NGL Preferred Unit Price for such canceled units equals the amount of
the finally resolved claims. If Precious Lady fails to comply with _Section
5.10_ and such failure continues for 20 Business Days after Buyer provides
notice of such failure, Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
cause NGL to cancel all of the NGL Preferred Units issued by NGL to Precious
Lady hereunder. The Parties and Precious Lady agree that all NGL Preferred
Units canceled pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ shall be so canceled and
forfeited by the holder thereof, and such cancelation and forfeiture shall be
binding on the holder of such canceled NGL Preferred Units and their
respective successors and assigns, automatically and without any action of
such Person. The number of cancelled NGL Preferred Units shall be based upon
the 10-day volume weighted average price of the NGL Preferred Units on the
NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P.) over the period beginning on the date
that is 10 days prior to the forfeiture thereof.

(a) WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY

OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE ASSETS AND THE BUSINESS.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.10_ shall be
the exclusive representations and warranties with regard to Environmental Laws
and related matters.

 



 

 **Section 8.7** **_Purchase Price Adjustment_**. The Parties agree to treat
all payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

AND AGREE THAT EACH PARTYS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT FOLLOWING CLOSING SHALL BE PURSUANT TO THE
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RIGHTS SET FORTH
IN THE CONVEYANCE.

 



 

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY HERETO
SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR LOST BENEFITS, LOSS OF ENTERPRISE VALUE,
DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF ANY BUSINESS, DAMAGES TO REPUTATION OR LOSS TO
GOODWILL, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR
OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT;

 



     

 

 



 

 _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS _SECTION 8.8(B)_ SHALL NOT LIMIT A
PARTYS RIGHT TO RECOVERY HEREUNDER FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT SUCH
PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A NON-AFFILIATE THIRD PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO SPECIFIC
PERFORMANCE EXCEPT AS RELATED TO A BREACH OF _SECTION 5.4, SECTION 9.1_ OR
PURSUANT TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF _SECTION 8.2(A)_.

 



 

 **Section 8.9** **_Express Negligence_**. THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THE
INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE VIII_ BE CONSTRUED AND APPLIED AS
WRITTEN ABOVE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY RULE OF CONSTRUCTION TO THE CONTRARY.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SUCH INDEMNITIES WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING
ANY STATES "EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE" OR SIMILAR RULE THAT WOULD DENY COVERAGE

the Buyer Approvals, as applicable. With respect to each preferential purchase
right set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ , Seller shall, promptly following the date
hereof, send the holder of such right a notice in compliance with the

preferential purchase right has not expired prior to Closing, that Asset shall
be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the allocated value of the relevant Asset set forth on
_Schedule 3.3_. If the preferential purchase right holder fails to consummate
the purchase of the Asset in accordance with the applicable agreement, then
Seller shall notify Buyer, and Buyer

 



     

 

 



 

shall purchase such Asset from Seller, under the terms of this Agreement for a
price equal to the allocated value of the Asset set forth on _Schedule 3.3_.

 



 

 **Section 9.3** **_Conduct and Preservation of Business_**. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, Seller will conduct the Business and its operations

 **Section 9.4** **_Restrictions_** ** _on Certain Actions_**. Without
limiting the generality of any other provision of this _Article IX_, and
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, Seller will not take, consent to or allow any of the following
actions, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned):

on the date hereof to lapse or expire without replacement thereof;

 



 

(e) allow insurance coverage on the Assets maintained as of the date hereof to

any agreement with any Tax Authority with respect to the assets (including a
"closing agreement" within the meaning of Code Section 7121);

 



 

(g) commit to make any capital expenditures that would be payable by Buyer
after Closing (including any that would be reimbursed to Mesquite by Buyer
under the Operating Agreement after Closing) in excess of $250,000 per matter
or set of related matters;

 



 

(h) fail to make any planned expenditures with respect to upkeep of the Assets
in the normal course of business, or otherwise allow the condition of the
Assets to deteriorate beyond ordinary wear and tear;

 



     

 

 



 

(i) change or modify its credit, collection or payment policies, procedures or

_Section 9.4_.

 



 

 **Section 9.5** **_Full Access_** _._ Seller will permit Representatives of
Buyer to have full access at all reasonable times, and in a manner so as not

 **Section 9.6** **_Notice of Developments_** _._ Each Party will give prompt
written notice to the other Party of any material adverse development causing
a breach of any of its own representations and warranties in _Article III_ or
_Article IV_, as applicable. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this
_Section 9.6_, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedule or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or
breach of covenant.

 



 

 **Section 9.7** **_Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing in
the following manner:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer, if:

 



 

(i) the Closing has not occurred, or cannot occur, on or before August 31,
2019, unless such failure to close is due to: (A) a breach of this Agreement;
or (B) failure to use Reasonable Efforts to satisfy the conditions to
obligations set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, in each case by the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i); _provided_
that Buyer shall have the right to extend this date and Seller will not have
the right to terminate under this clause (i) for so long as (x) approval or
expiration of the waiting period under any Antitrust Law is pending and Buyer
is attempting to obtain such approval and otherwise working in good faith
towards satisfying the conditions precedent to Sellers obligation to close or
(y) reasonably necessary for Buyer to obtain the information and complete the
audits necessary to permit it to timely file the current report on Form 8-K
under the Exchange Act to be filed on or before the 71st calendar day after
the initial Form 8-K to be filed within four Business Days following the
Closing; or

 



 

(ii) there is any statute, rule, or regulation that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited or
a Governmental Authority has issued an order, decree, or ruling or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
order, decree, ruling, or other action has become final and nonappealable;

 



 

(c) by Seller, if (i) Buyer has failed to fulfill any of its material
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any of the representations and
warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement

 



     

 

 



 

are not true and correct in all material respects and, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii), such failure, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty
has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from
Seller to Buyer; or

 



 

(d) by Buyer, if (i) Seller has failed to fulfill any of its material
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any of the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement are not true and correct in
all material respects and, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), such
failure, misrepresentation or breach of warranty has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Buyer to Seller.

 



 

 **Section 9.8** **_Effect of Termination_**. If this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 9.7_ by either Seller or Buyer, written notice of
the termination will promptly be given to the other Party specifying the
provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and
this Agreement will become void and have no effect, except that the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.7_, and in _Article X_ will
survive the termination hereof. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.8_ will
relieve any Party to this Agreement from liability for Losses actually
incurred as a result of any breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.9** **_Disposals Operating, LLC_**. Prior to the Closing, Seller
shall (a) form a new Delaware limited liability company named "Disposals
Operating, LLC" that is a wholly owned Subsidiary of Mesquite, and (b)
contribute the assets set forth on _Schedule 9.9_ to Disposals Operating, LLC,
free and clear of all Liens. As of Closing, 100% of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of Disposals Operating, LLC shall be deemed included in the
"Assets". As of Closing, Seller hereby makes the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ with respect to both the equity
interests of Disposals Operating, LLC and the assets of Disposals Operating,
LLC as if both were "Assets" hereunder, _mutatis mutandis_. Seller further
represents and warrants as of Closing that Disposals Operating, LLC (i) was
newly formed after the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing for the
sole purpose of facilitating the transaction and holding the contracts set
forth on _Schedule 9.9_ , (ii) has not conducted any business or engaged in
any activities other than those related to its formation and related to the
transfer of the contracts set forth on _Schedule 9.9_ , (iii) has no
liabilities other than in connection with its formation and executory
obligations under the contracts set forth on _Schedule 9.9_ , and (iv) is not
a party to any contract or agreement other than the Disposals Operating, LLC

or to such other address or addresses as the Parties may from time to time

 **Section 10.2** **_Assignment_**. No Party shall assign this Agreement or
any part hereof without the prior written consent of the other Party which
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that Buyer may assign
to an Affiliate without consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 10.3** **_Rights of Third Parties_**. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than Buyer and Seller to any Losses, remedy or
right of any kind, except as to those rights expressly provided to the Seller
Indemnified Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties ( _provided, however_ ,
any claim for indemnity hereunder on behalf of a Seller Indemnified Party or a
Buyer Indemnified Party must be made and administered by a Party).

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions herein contemplated whether or not such transactions
shall be consummated, including all fees of its legal counsel, financial
advisers and accountants.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts (delivery of which may be made by facsimile or
electronically in PDF format), each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any
facsimile or PDF copies hereof or signatures hereon shall, for all purposes,
be deemed originals.

 



 

 **Section 10.6** **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement (together with the
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement) constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersede any other agreements, whether
written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of

contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 10.7** **_Disclosure Schedule_** ** _s_**. Unless the context
otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules
shall have the respective meanings assigned in this Agreement. No reference to
or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any information in
the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment by Seller, in and of itself, that such information is material
to or outside the ordinary course of the Business or required to be disclosed
on the Disclosure Schedules. The disclosure of an item in one section of the
Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception
with respect to all other covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties only to the extent that the relevance of such item to each such
other covenant, representation, agreement or warranty is readily apparent on
its face.

 



 

 **Section 10.8** **_Waiver_**. Seller or Buyer may: (i) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained herein or in any document, certificate, or writing delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) waive compliance by the other Party with any
of the others covenants or agreements under this Agreement; or (iii) waive
any conditions to its own obligations contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to this Agreement to any such waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of
that Party. No failure or delay by a Party to this Agreement in

 



     

 

 



 

exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement will operate as
a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power,
or privilege.

 



 

 **Section 10.9** **_Amendments_**. This Agreement may be amended or modified
in whole or in part, and terms and conditions may be waived, only by a duly
authorized agreement in writing which makes reference to this Agreement
executed by each Party.

 



 

 **Section 10.10** **_Publicity_**. All press releases or other public
communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for publication
thereof, shall be subject to the prior written consent of Buyer and Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may publish such press releases or other
public communications as such Party may consider necessary in order to satisfy
such Partys obligations at Law or under the rules of any stock or commodities
exchange after consultation with the other Party as is reasonable under the
circumstances and providing the other Party the opportunity to review such
press release or other public communication.

 



 

 **Section 10.11** **_Severability_**. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid
or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the Parties to the greatest extent legally permissible.

 



 

 **Section 10.12** **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Texas without regard to the Laws that might be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles and venue for any suit arising out of or
related to this Agreement shall lie exclusively in Midland County, Texas.

 



 

(b) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

 



 

 **Section 10.13** **_Further Assurances_**. Seller shall execute and deliver
or cause to be executed and delivered to Buyer, and Buyer shall execute and
deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to Seller, such further
instruments of transfer, assignment and conveyance as the other Party may
reasonably request to more effectively carry out the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.14** **_Confidentiality_**. Buyer and Mesquite are parties to
