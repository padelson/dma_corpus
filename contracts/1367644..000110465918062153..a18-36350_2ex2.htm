Amount_ " and will be added to the Base Cash Consideration in accordance with

The Estimated Initial Purchase Price, as so increased or decreased in
accordance with this _Section 2.6(a)_, shall be the " _Final Initial Purchase
Price_ " hereunder.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than [***] days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers Representative a statement (the
" _Closing Date Statement_ "), executed by an officer of Buyer, of Buyers

with the requirements of this Agreement, including _Schedule II_ hereto, and
on a basis consistent with the methodologies, policies, practices,
classifications, judgments, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles
used in the Financial Statements (to the extent not inconsistent with the
requirements of this Agreement and _Schedule II_ hereof, including the
definitions herein).

 



 

(c) Buyer shall permit Sellers Representative and his Representatives
(provided such representatives are subject to a duty of confidentiality and
Sellers shall be responsible to Buyer for any breaches of such duty of
confidentiality) reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of Buyer or the Company, to books and records, and
personnel of the Company and the Subsidiaries utilized in preparing the
Closing Date Statement to permit Sellers Representative and his
Representatives to review the Closing Date Statement. Sellers Representative
and his Representatives shall have the right to review the work papers of
Buyer, and those of Buyers accountants (subject to Sellers Representative
and his Representatives entering into any customary undertaking required by
Buyers accountants in connection therewith), underlying, or utilized in
preparing, the Closing Date Statement and Buyers calculation of the Final
Initial Purchase Price to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the
accuracy and fairness of the presentation of the Closing Date Statement and
Buyers calculation of the Final Initial Purchase Price in conformity with
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Within thirty (30) calendar days after his receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Sellers Representative shall either inform Buyer in writing that
the Closing Date Statement is

with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

acceptable or object thereto in writing, setting forth a specific description
of each of his objections. If Sellers Representative so objects and the
parties do not resolve such objections on a mutually agreeable basis within
thirty (30) calendar days after Buyers receipt of Sellers Representatives
objections, the remaining disputed items shall be resolved within an
additional thirty (30) calendar days by an internationally recognized
independent public accounting firm that is not affiliated with either party
and which shall be reasonably acceptable to both Buyer and the Sellers
Representative in writing (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). In
connection with its review, Buyer shall make available to such Independent
Accounting Firm the materials and personnel referred to in _Section 2.6(b)_
and _Section 2.6(c)_, above, and Sellers Representative shall make available
to such Independent Accounting Firm the workpapers generated in connection
with Sellers Representatives review of the Closing Date Statement and those
used in the preparation of the Initial Closing Date Statement referred to in
_Section 2.5_. Upon the agreement of Buyer and Sellers Representative, the
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm, or if Sellers Representative
fails to deliver an objection to Buyer within the first 30-day period referred
to above, the Closing Date Statement, as adjusted, if applicable (the " _Final
Closing Date Statement_ "), shall be final, conclusive and binding against the
parties hereto. The statements of Closing Cash, Working Capital, Indebtedness,
Unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, and Funded Expense Amount set forth in the
Final Closing Date Statement shall be the " _Final Closing Cash_ ", " _Final
Closing Working Capital_ ", " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Unpaid
Seller Transaction Expenses_ " and, " _Final Funded Expense Amount_ " for all
purposes hereunder.

 



 

(e) In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall
be bound by the provisions of this _Section 2.6_, (ii) may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value claimed for such item or less than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Sellers
Representative in the Closing Date Statement or objection delivered pursuant
to _Section 2.6(d)_, respectively, (iii) shall limit its decision to such
items as are in dispute and (iv) shall make its determination based solely on
presentations by Buyer and Sellers Representative which are in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not
on the basis of independent review). The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Buyer and Sellers in such a way
that (i) Buyer shall be responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar value
of disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that are
resolved against Buyer (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm) and the denominator of which is the total dollar value of the disputed
items so submitted and (ii) Sellers shall be responsible for the remaining
amount of fees and expenses, which amount shall be paid solely out of the
Temporary Escrow Amount to the extent the funds therein exceed all amounts
finally determined to be payable therefrom to Buyer and the Independent
Accounting Firm or as agreed by Buyer and Sellers Representative. In the
event of any dispute regarding such allocation, the Independent Accounting
Firm shall determine the allocation of its fees and expenses as between Buyer
and Sellers in accordance with such allocation methodology, such determination
to be final and binding on both Buyer and Sellers.

 



 

(f) If the Estimated Initial Purchase Price exceeds the Final Initial Purchase
Price, then, within [***] after the determination of the Final Initial
Purchase Price, Sellers Representative and

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (i) release an amount equal
to the Estimated Initial Purchase Price less the Final Initial Purchase Price
to Buyer from the Temporary Escrow Account (and the Indemnification Escrow
Account, if the Temporary Escrow Account shall be insufficient to satisfy such
amount), (ii) release any fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
payable by Sellers to the Independent Accounting Firm, and (iii) release to
Sellers the entire balance of the Temporary Escrow Account (if any) following
the distributions in clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_ above, to Sellers in
accordance with the percentages set forth in the Funds Flow Memorandum.

 



 

(g) If the Estimated Initial Purchase Price is less than the Final Initial
Purchase Price, then, within [***] after the determination of the Final
Initial Purchase Price, (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Final Initial Purchase
Price less the Estimated Initial Purchase Price, in accordance with the
percentages set forth in the Funds Flow Memorandum and (ii) Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) release any fees
and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm payable by Sellers to the
Independent Accounting Firm and (B) release to Sellers the entire balance of
the Temporary Escrow Account (if any) following the distribution in clause (A)
above to Sellers in accordance with the percentages set forth in the Funds
Flow Memorandum.

 



 

(h) All payments under _Sections 2.6(f)_ and _(g)_ are subject to reduction
as and to the extent set forth in _Section 6.16(a)_.

 



 

2.7 _Company Options_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the board of directors of the Company shall have adopted resolutions,
and the Company hereby agrees to take all other necessary actions, to cause
each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to Closing (whether
vested or unvested and whether or not exercisable) to be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive, without
interest and as the sole consideration in respect of such Company Option, an
aggregate amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of
the fair market value of a Company ordinary share (determined by the Companys
board of directors in accordance with the Company Option Plan and consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code) over the exercise price set
forth in the award agreement for such Company Option multiplied by (2) the
number of Company shares subject to such Company Option (" _Cash Out Payment_
"), subject to any applicable income and payroll Taxes required to be withheld
(" _Required Withholding_ "). Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall provide the notice required under Section 6.7
of the Company Option Plan to each holder of an outstanding Company Option
concerning the effect of the resolution of the board of directors of the
Company as described in this _Section 2.7_. Each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing Date, when canceled, extinguished and
converted in accordance with this _Section 2.7_, shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist. If the
exercise price set forth in the award agreement for any Company Option is
equal to or greater than the fair market value of a Company ordinary share
(determined under the conditions described above), such Company Option shall
be canceled without payment therefor and shall have no further force or
effect. Subject to receipt of a properly completed and duly executed option
cancellation letter in substantially the form attached

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

hereto as _Exhibit B_, from each such holder of Company Options, the Company
shall cause the applicable Subsidiary employer to make the applicable Cash Out
Payments less Required Withholding, to all holders of Company Options entitled
to payment therefor prior to Closing.

 



 

2.8 _Earn-Out Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Milestone Events; Earn-Out Payments_. Following the first occurrence of
each event described in the table set forth below (each, a " _Milestone Event_

2.8(a)_, _Section 6.16(a)_ and _Section 2.8(b)_, pay the Sellers an
aggregate amount (each, an " _Earn-Out Payment_ ") equal to the sum of (i) the

BAML in respect of such Earn-Out Payment pursuant to the terms of the
engagement letter entered into between the Company and BAML prior to the date
of this Agreement, which amount the Buyer will pay or cause the Company to pay

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

[***] The maximum amount of the Earn-Out Payments [***] payable pursuant to
this _Section 2.8_ [***] shall be one hundred million Dollars ($100,000,000).

 



 

(b) _Notice and Payment_. With respect to each Milestone Event described in
_Section 2.8(a)_, no later than [***] after the [***] in which such Milestone
Event occurs, Buyer shall provide notice to the Sellers Representative of the
occurrence of such Milestone Event. [***]. Buyer shall pay interest on any
Earn-Out Payment to be made under this _Section 2.8_ that is not paid when
due (except to the extent such Earn-Out Payment (or any portion thereof) is
withheld or applied to reduce any indemnification obligation of Sellers in
accordance with _Section 10.8_) at an annual rate equal to [***] the U.S.
prime interest rate, as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ (New York
edition) for the first Business Day of the month in which such payment becomes
due, accruing daily beginning on the day after such Earn-Out Payment is due
and ending on the day prior to the date on which such Earn-Out Payment is
actually made.

 



 

(c) _Net Sales Reports_. Within [***] after the end of [***] following the
Closing Date, and ending on the earliest of (i) the date upon which the last
Earn-Out Payment (assuming achievement in full of the second Milestone Event)
has been made and (ii) December 31, 2022 (the period beginning on the Closing
and ending on the earliest to occur of (i) and (ii), the " _Earn-Out Period_
"), Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative with a true, correct and
complete report (in reasonable detail) setting forth the Net Sales for such
preceding [***] (each, a " _Net Sales Report_ ").

 



 

(d) _Books and Records; Audit_. During the Earn-Out Period and for six (6)
months thereafter, Buyer shall keep and maintain reasonably detailed books and
records of Net Sales and each deduction included in the definition of Net
Sales. Sellers Representative shall have the right to examine and audit
Buyers relevant books and records to verify the accuracy of Net Sales Reports
delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Any such audit shall be on at
least ten (10) Business Days prior written notice. Sellers Representatives
right to perform an audit under this _Section 2.8(d)_ shall be limited to not
more than one (1) such audit in any calendar year and shall not be exercised
for any calendar quarter more than three (3) years after the end of such
calendar quarter. The audit shall be performed at Sellers Representatives
sole expense by an independent certified public accounting firm of
internationally recognized standing that is selected by Sellers
Representative and approved by Buyer (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The accounting firm shall be required to
enter into a reasonable and customary confidentiality agreement with Buyer to
protect the confidentiality of its books and records. Buyer shall make the
relevant books and records reasonably available during normal business hours
for examination by the accounting firm, including, upon the accounting firms

dataroom or other electronic means. Upon completion of the audit, the
accounting firm shall provide both Buyer and Sellers Representative a written
report disclosing whether or not the relevant Net Sales Report(s) are correct,
and the specific details concerning any discrepancies. If the accounting firm
conducting an audit pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ concludes, as a result of
such audit, that a Milestone Event was achieved, but the corresponding Earn-
Out Payment was not paid to Sellers, unless such conclusion is disputed by
Buyer as set forth below in this _Section 2.8(d)_, Buyer shall (x) pay such

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

Earn-Out Payment to Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.8(a)_ within ten
(10) Business Days of the date that the parties receive such accountants
written report, together with interest thereon at a rate of [***] per annum
from the date on which such Earn-Out Payment was originally due until the date
of payment and (y) reimburse Sellers Representative for the documented out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in conducting the audit.

 



 

In the event that Buyer disputes the finding of any audit conducted pursuant
to this _Section 2.8_, Buyer shall so notify Sellers Representative within
[***] after the date on which the parties receive the accountants written
report, in which event Buyer and Sellers Representative shall work in good
faith to resolve the dispute. If Buyer and Sellers Representative are unable
to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such dispute within thirty
(30) days, such dispute shall be submitted for resolution to an Independent
Accounting Firm. The decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
final and, if the Independent Accounting Firm concludes that no Milestone
Event was achieved, the costs of such dispute resolution as well as the
initial audit shall be borne between the parties in such manner as the
Independent Accounting Firm shall determine. If the Independent Accounting
Firm concludes, as a result of such review, that a Milestone Event was
achieved, but the corresponding Earn-Out Payment was not paid to Sellers, not
later than [***] after such decision and in accordance with such decision,
Buyer shall (1) pay to Sellers the applicable Earn-Out Payment together with
interest thereon at a rate of [***] per annum from the date on which such
Earn-Out Payment was originally due until the date of payment thereof and (2)
reimburse Sellers Representative for the documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in conducting the initial audit conducted pursuant to this _Section
2.8_, as well as those incurred in respect of such dispute resolution.

 



 

(e) _Certain Covenants_. From the Closing Date through the end of the Earn-Out
Period, Buyer covenants and agrees that it will, itself or through the
Company, the Subsidiaries or another Affiliate of Buyer, (i) use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to commercialize the Company Products that were
commercially sold by or on behalf of the Company or a Subsidiary prior to
Closing or that are commercially launched by Buyer or its Affiliates (in their
sole discretion) after Closing and (ii) not take any action, the primary
purpose of which is to avoid achievement of any Milestone Event. For purposes
of this _Section 2.8(e)_, to use " _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_ " means,
with respect to the efforts to be expended by Buyer (whether directly or
through the efforts of its Affiliates) pursuant to this _Section 2.8(e)_,
[***].

 



 

(f) _Acceleration; Continuing Obligation_. Upon the occurrence of any of the
following events, any Earn-Out Payments that have not been paid shall be
immediately due and payable in full, whether or not the corresponding
Milestone Event has occurred: [***]

 



 

(g) _Limited Right of Setoff_. The Buyer may not deduct from, set off,
holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner whatsoever any amount owed to
Sellers hereunder against any amounts owed by Sellers to Buyer, other than as
expressly permitted in _Section 10.8(b)_ hereof.

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



       
 

 



 

(h) _Earn-Out Payments Not a Security._ The Earn-Out Payments are contingent
payments subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the parties
do not intend for the contingent right of any Seller to receive Earn-Out
Payments to be a security. Accordingly, the contingent right of any Seller to
receive Earn-Out Payments (i) shall not be represented by a certificate, (ii)
does not represent an ownership interest in Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary, (iii) does not entitle any Seller to any rights common to
equityholders of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary and (iv) is a non-
interest bearing contingent payment. The contingent right of any Seller to
receive Earn-Out Payments pursuant to this Agreement shall not be transferable
or assignable without the prior written consent of Buyer, other than by will,
the applicable Laws of intestacy or other operation of applicable Law.

privacy and information security obligations to which it is subject under
applicable Law and applicable industry self-regulatory principles applicable

flex" provisions and the economic terms of the "flex" provisions contained
therein redacted and other customary redactions that do not materially

contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter. As of the date
of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letter or any related Fee Letter.

of determination, that (i) the amount of the "present fair saleable value" of
the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) will, as of
such date, exceed the amount of all recorded liabilities of the Company and
the Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (ii) the Company and the

money to (a) remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder,
(b) obtain any consent required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (c) provide financing to Buyer for consummation of the

with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection

a private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and
of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by

with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the
extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental
Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,
as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, Foreign
Competition Laws and all other federal, state and local statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or

(c) [***]. Buyer shall diligently assist and cooperate with Sellers in
preparing and filing any and all written communications that are to be

from any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Law; _provided_ ,
that such copies may be redacted as necessary to address legal privilege or
confidentiality concerns or to comply with applicable Law; _provided_
_further_ , that portions of such copies that are competitively sensitive may
be designated as "outside antitrust counsel only"; (C) keeping Sellers
reasonably informed of any communication received or given in connection with
any action or proceeding by Buyer, in each case regarding the transactions

one hand, nor Sellers, on the other hand, shall initiate or participate in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to any
filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any filings under the
HSR Act or any Antitrust Law, without providing the other party with
reasonable prior notice of such meeting or discussion and, to the extent
permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting

Act and Foreign Competition Laws. [***]

 



 

6.6 _Preservation of Records; Post-Closing Access_.

the Subsidiaries shall preserve and retain, all corporate, accounting, legal,
auditing, human resources and other books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries (including any documents relating to any governmental or non-
governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations) relating
to the conduct of the business and operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. Prior to disposing of any such records
after such seven (7) year period, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall
afford the Sellerss Representative the opportunity to take possession of or
obtain copies of any such records.

 



 

(b) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company
and the Subsidiaries shall, after the Closing Date, afford the Sellers
Representative or his Representative reasonable access, upon reasonable
request and notice, during normal business hours to the books, records,
officers and employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries to the extent
reasonably necessary to prepare Tax Returns or financial statements, comply
with tax audits or applicable regulatory reporting obligations, to exercise or
enforce Sellers rights under, or defend against any claim or allegation made
against any of them pursuant to or in relation to the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or to defend against
any Third Party Claim in accordance with _Article X_ or any other claim by
any third party, in each case to the extent that such access and disclosure
would not obligate Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to take any
actions that would unreasonably disrupt the normal course of their businesses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require Buyer, the Company
or the Subsidiaries to provide access or to disclose any information to
Sellers Representative if such access or disclosure (i) would be in violation
of applicable Law or (ii) would, in the Buyers good faith and reasonable
determination after consultation with counsel, destroy or compromise attorney-
client privilege or any similar privilege that may be applicable thereto.

 



 

6.7 _Employees and Benefits_.

 



 

(a)

 



 

(i) For a period of no less than [***] following the Closing Date, Buyer shall

as a result of (A) the voluntary resignation of such Company Employee or (B)
the involuntary termination of such Company Employee for misconduct or gross

Employee with [***].

 



 

(iii) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may, at its sole discretion, establish
[***].

 



 

(b) This _Section 6.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit

express or implied, shall confer upon any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent of such employee or former employee),
or any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this _Section 6.7_. No provision of this Agreement shall (i) be
construed to establish, amend or modify any Benefit Plan or any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement; (ii) alter or limit the ability of the
Company, Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Benefit Plan at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them (except as provided in _Section 6.7(e)_); or (iii)
prohibit or prevent the Company, Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates
from terminating the employment of any employee (including any Company
Employee) following the Closing date. This _Section 6.7_ shall not create any
right in any employee (including any Company Employee) or any other Person to
any continued employment with the Company, Buyer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, or
otherwise alters any existing at-will employment relationship between any
employee and the Company.

 



 

(c) Each Company Employee and former employee of a Subsidiary shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the
Subsidiaries before the Closing Date under any employee benefit plan of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates providing benefits similar to those provided under a
Benefit Plan (including under any applicable pension, 401(k), savings,
medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave
entitlements, post-retirement health and life insurance, termination
indemnity, severance or separation pay plans) to the same extent as such
employee or former employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit
for such service under such Benefit Plan for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, level of severance and paid time off benefits, and
vesting, except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of
benefits for the same period of service. With respect to the calendar year in
which Buyer or any of its Affiliates ceases to maintain any particular Benefit
Plan (or to the extent an employee ceases to participate in a Benefit Plan in
connection with or following the Closing Date), Buyer shall give each employee
credit for amounts paid under such Benefit Plan for the applicable plan year
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums
(including any lifetime maximums) as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the parallel plan, program or
arrangement of Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall waive or cause to be waived for each Company Employee and his
or her dependents any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a

with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been

prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates applicable to such Company Employee to the extent such
waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or other restriction would not have been applicable to such
Company Employee under the terms of the welfare plans of the Company and the
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) In any termination or layoff of any Company Employee by Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing, Buyer will comply, and shall cause
its applicable Subsidiary to comply, fully with all applicable foreign,
Federal, state and local laws, including those prohibiting discrimination and
requiring notice to employees.

 



 

(f) If requested by Buyer in a writing delivered to the Company following the
date hereof and not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary shall take all necessary action
(including the adoption of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of
required notices) to terminate, effective the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, any Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan under Code Section 401(k). The Company or the
applicable Subsidiary shall provide Buyer with a copy of the resolutions, plan
amendments, notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the termination
of such plan or plans in advance and provide Buyer with the final
documentation evidencing the termination.

 



 

6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a form and at a
time agreed to by Buyer and Sellers Representative. Thereafter, Buyer and the

which any party may make primarily regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. None of, the Sellers Representative, any
Seller or Buyer shall, and they shall cause their respective Affiliates not

Representatives not to, make, issue, release, file, publish, or disseminate
any public release, filing, notification, announcement or other communication

hereby or the financial or other effects of such transactions without the
prior consent of the other party, except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC,
securities exchange rules or regulation or any Governmental Authority, and in
the event such disclosure is required, a party may include such information as
it customarily discloses with respect to similar transactions; _provided_ that
if a release or announcement may be required by applicable Law, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the SEC, securities exchange rules or regulation or any
Governmental Authority, each party shall (to the extent practicable and
legally permissible) allow the other party reasonable time to review and
comment on all public releases, filings, notifications, announcements or other
communications concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby in advance of their issuance, release, filing, dissemination or
publication and shall consider the other partys comments in good faith. At
any time following the issuance of the initial press release, any party
hereto, and its Representatives, shall be permitted to make any public
announcements regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of any other parties, to the extent
such announcements are consistent with such press release or other prior
disclosures approved in accordance with this _Section 6.8_.

the Company and the Subsidiaries to jointly and severally indemnify and hold
harmless all of their past and present officers and directors to the same

the date hereof pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or any agreement between the Company or the Subsidiaries and such
officer or director, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall not permit the Company or the Subsidiaries to
amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Companys or the Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents, or any agreement with such officer or director
relating to the exculpation or indemnification of former officers and
directors as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 6.9_ and
not in limitation thereof (and without in any way limiting or modifying the
obligations of any insurance carrier contemplated by this _Section 6.9_),

Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent
currently permitted by the Companys and the Subsidiaries Organizational
Documents, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any liability to
the Company or the Subsidiaries), the individuals who, on or prior to the
Closing Date, were officers, directors, or employees or agents of the Company
or the Subsidiaries or served on behalf of the Company or the Subsidiaries as
an officer, director or employee or agent of any of the Companys current or
former subsidiaries or Affiliates (collectively, " _Covered Affiliates_ ") or
any of their predecessors in all of their capacities (including as member or
shareholder, controlling or otherwise) and the heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries and administrators of such officers, directors or employees or
agents (each a " _D andO Indemnitee_" and, collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnitees_") against all DandO Expenses (as defined below), losses, claims,
damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (" _D andO Costs_") in respect
of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising
out of or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer,
employee, or shareholder (controlling or otherwise) of the Company or the
Subsidiaries or Covered Affiliates or any of their predecessors arising out of
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, except (x) for
intentional acts or omissions which involve conduct constituting common law
fraud or in violation of applicable Law or (y) with regard to any claims made
under and in accordance with this Agreement or any Related Agreement (any such
claim, action suit or proceeding, a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii)
subject to the receipt by Buyer or a written undertaking, by or on behalf of
such DandO Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such DandO Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under
this _Section 6.9_ or otherwise, advance to such DandO Indemnitees all DandO
Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in
circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such
claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor,
except to the extent that such expenses have been paid by an insurer under the
policy referred to in _Section 6.9(c)_ below. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claim
shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all
judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO
Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied. For the

purposes of this _Section 6.9(b)_, " _D andO Expenses_" shall include
reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, charges and
expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain, at Buyers sole cost and
expense a prepaid, irrevocable, "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by the Companys
and the Subsidiaries directors and officers liability insurance policy on
terms not less favorable than such existing insurance coverage and with a
claims period of at least [***] years following the Closing; _provided_ that
the cost of such "tail" insurance policy shall not be required to exceed an
amount equal to [***]% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
and the Subsidiaries for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such
amount is insufficient for such coverage, the Company shall spend (at Buyers
expense) up to (but no greater than) such amount to obtain "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policies with the greatest coverage
available at such cost.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing indefinitely. In
the event that Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, Buyer shall cause the successors
and assigns of Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to
expressly assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.9_.

the Sellers agree to cooperate with Buyer and the Company (and its
Subsidiaries) in the filing of any such Tax Returns, including promptly
supplying any information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to

regarding, any applicable Tax Returns with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries and payments in respect thereof, including (i) providing timely

(including for purposes of determining the Net Tax Amount and Pre-Closing
Taxes):

 



 

(i) The amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, sales, use,
receipts or other similar items of the Company or the Subsidiaries for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (for avoidance of doubt,
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in
proportion to the number of days in each period by the interim closing of the
books as of the Closing Date).

 



 

(ii) The amount of any other Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries which
relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Tax Period.

 



 

(iii) For avoidance of doubt, all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as occurring during the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(d) _Tax Sharing and Tax Indemnification Agreements_. Any Tax Sharing

the Sellers Representative for his review and comment at least thirty (30)
days prior to the filing of such Tax Return, or, in the case of any Tax Return

Return or such shorter time period as is reasonably necessary to ensure Buyer
is not prevented from filing such Tax Return in a timely manner.

 



 

(ii) In the case of the Irish Tax Return of the Company for the Straddle Tax
Period, Buyer shall make the appropriate election under section 434(3A)(a) TCA
1997 of the Tax Return to elect that any cash distribution made in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period is not treated as a distribution for Irish tax purposes.

 



 

(f) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) If, after the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary receives
any notice, letter, correspondence, claim or decree relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period from any Taxing Authority (" _Tax Notice_ "), Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company or the Subsidiaries to deliver such Tax Notice to
the Sellers Representative within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
Similarly, if the Sellers Representative receives a Tax Notice, the Sellers
Representative shall deliver such Tax Notice to Buyer within ten (10) days
after receipt thereof. The failure to timely provide notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.10(f)(i)_ shall not affect the rights of any Buyer Indemnified
Party to any indemnity under _Section 10.2_ unless the Sellers are actually
and materially prejudiced by such failure to timely notify the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(ii) Upon timely written notice to Buyer, the Sellers Representative shall
have the right to control any Tax Contest with respect to Taxes relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Tax Period); _provided_ that
Sellers shall be responsible for all costs and expenses (including any
deposits, bonds or prepayments of Taxes) required to be paid in order to
pursue such Tax Contest. Buyer shall have the right to participate at its own
expense in the defense of any Tax Contest controlled by the Sellers
Representative pursuant to this _Section 6.10(f)(ii)_. The Sellers
Representative may not settle any Tax Contest that it controls pursuant to
this _Section 6.10(f)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of Buyer and the
Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall have the right to control any Tax Contest with respect to
Taxes relating to any Straddle Tax Period at Buyers expense; provided the
Sellers Representative shall have the right to participate at its own expense
in the defense of any such Tax Contest to the extent such Tax Contest could
result in an indemnification obligation under _Section 10.2_ of this
Agreement. Buyer may not settle any Tax Contest in which the Sellers
Representative has a right to participate without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(h) _Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax of a Post-Closing
Tax Period to which Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries become
entitled, in each case, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and are not the
result of any carrybacks of any deduction, net operating loss, Tax credit or
similar Tax benefit item from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, shall be for the account of Sellers. Buyer shall pay over to Sellers
any such refund or the amount of any such credit (in each case net of any cost
and expenses of Buyer, the Company, or the relevant Subsidiaries incurred in
connection with, and relating to, obtaining or receiving such refund or
credit) within fifteen (15) Business Days after such receipt by, or actual
reduction in payments of a Tax liability of, the Company or the relevant
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge that
to the extent any amount of estimated Taxes or other prepayments of Taxes is
included in the determination of the Net Tax Amount and reduces the amount of
Estimated Closing Indebtedness or Final Closing Indebtedness, such amounts
shall be treated for purposes of this _Section 6.10(h)_ as repaid to Sellers
in full.

 



 

(i) _Amended Returns and Retroactive Elections_. Buyer shall not, and shall
not cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) amend any
Tax Returns filed with respect to any tax year ending on or before the Closing
Date or with respect to any Straddle Tax Period or (ii) make any Tax election
(other than an election under Section 336 or 338 of the Code pursuant to
_Section 6.10(g)_) that has retroactive effect to any such year or to any
Straddle Tax Period, in each such case without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld) or as required
by applicable Law.

 



 

(j) The survival period of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.10_
shall include the statute of limitations applicable to the collection of any
Taxes with respect to which Sellers are obligated to indemnify Buyer pursuant
to _Section_ 10.2(a).

 



 

6.11 _Transactions Outside the Ordinary Course of Business_. Any Taxes
incurred as a result of any actions or transactions on the Closing Date, but
after the Closing, taken by Buyer, or any of its Affiliates, including the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, that are not in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and not contemplated by this Agreement
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement and for purposes of filing all relevant Tax Returns as
occurring on the day after the Closing Date. Sellers shall have no liability
under this Agreement or otherwise for such Taxes and Buyer shall indemnify and
hold Sellers harmless from such Taxes.

 



 

6.12 _Section 280G_. If required to avoid the imposition of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, concurrent with such
written notice, Sellers shall deliver to its shareholders a disclosure
statement intended to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, soliciting the consent of its shareholders to the
transactions disclosed therein. Buyer shall provide Sellers with all relevant
terms of any employment contracts or other arrangements that will be entered
with the "disqualified individuals" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) of the Company and the Subsidiaries on or around the Closing Date that
could result in payments and other terms (including, rights to severances or
signing bonuses) that need to be approved (or disclosed) to ensure the
disclosure and consent under the previous sentence is valid. If the only
reason the disclosure and consent is necessary is because of the amounts

 



     

 

 



 

disclosed by Buyer pursuant to the previous sentence, Buyer shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by any shareholder of the
Company, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to provide the disclosure and
solicit the consent. To the extent information provided by Buyer is incorrect
or incomplete in any respect, all Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries
for any Taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be
computed for purposes of this Agreement assuming that no payment made by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries is nondeductible under Section 280G of the
Code or subject to an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

6.13 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary or
advisable to obtain, arrange and consummate the Debt Financing as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and, in any event,
not later than the Closing Date, on substantially the terms and conditions
(including, to the extent applicable, the "flex" provisions), taken as a
whole, described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on substantially the terms and
conditions (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the
terms, and within the limits, of the flex provisions contained in any Fee
Letter) or otherwise in a manner not materially adverse to the Sellers (the "
_Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "), (ii) satisfy in all material
respects on a timely basis all conditions and covenants (including with
respect to the payment of any ticking, commitment, engagement or placement
fees) applicable to and within the control of Buyer in the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Fee Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and (iii)
in the event of the failure to fund by the Debt Financing Sources in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing
Documents, enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to cause the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreement to fund their
commitment in accordance with their respective obligations. In the event that
Buyer seeks to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and
Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or cause the financing sources to fund the
Debt Financing (any such action, a " _Financing Action_ "), Buyer shall (x)
keep the Sellers Representative reasonably informed of the status of such
Financing Action, and (y) at the reasonable request of the Sellers
Representative, shall make Buyers employees and representatives reasonably
available to discuss the status of, and developments with respect to, such
Financing Action. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter, Buyer shall so notify the
Company in writing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
Closing Date required by _Section 2.3_, arrange and obtain from the same or
alternative sources of debt financing, debt financing in an amount, when
combined with any equity financing, amounts expected to be available under
Buyers committed revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement and
cash on hand, that is sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses, on terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that are not materially less
favorable to Buyer in the aggregate as those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the related Fee Letter and which shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, include any conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding of such alternative debt financing on the Closing
Date that are

 



     

 

 



 

materially more onerous than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the related Fee Letter in effect on the date hereof. The new debt commitment
letter and fee letter entered into in connection with such alternative debt
financing are referred to, respectively, as a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "
and a " _New Fee Letter_." Buyer shall provide the Company with (x) a copy of
the New Debt Commitment Letter and related New Fee Letter (with the fee
amounts, pricing caps and the economic terms of the "flex" provisions
contained therein redacted and other customary redactions that do not
materially adversely affect the conditionality of such alternative debt
financing) for any such alternative debt financing for its review prior to the
execution thereof and (y) fully executed copies thereof (which may be redacted
as aforesaid) as promptly as practicable following the execution thereof. In
the event Buyer enters into any such New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee
Letter, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean
the debt financing contemplated by the "Debt Commitment Letter" as such term
is modified pursuant to the immediately succeeding clause (ii), (ii) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Debt Commitment Letter," including the
definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include
the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter
to the extent then in effect and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Fee Letter" (and any definition incorporating the term "Fee Letter,"
including the definition of Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) shall be
deemed to include the Fee Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Fee
Letter at the time in question and any New Fee Letter to the extent then in
effect. Buyer shall keep the Company informed upon request, on a reasonably
prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Buyer be deemed or construed to require, either
Buyer to (i) pay any fees or other amounts to Debt Financing Sources in excess
of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter or (ii)
threaten, commence or pursue litigation, arbitration or other adversarial
proceedings against any Debt Financing Source or affiliate thereof.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall be permitted to amend or modify, or waive any provision under,
or supplement or replace in whole or in part (including through co-investments
or by financing from one or more additional parties), the Debt Commitment
Letter; _provided_ , that Buyer shall not affect any such amendment,
modification, waiver, supplement or replacement without the Companys prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if
such amendment, modification, waiver, supplement or replacement:

 



 

(i) reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount, other than pursuant to the terms of any "flex"
provisions contained in the Fee Letter, if applicable);

 



 

(ii) has the effect of expanding, amending or modifying the Marketing Period
(as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing);

 



     

 

 



 

(iii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the Debt Financing, or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in each
case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or
make materially less likely the Closing or the funding of the Debt Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date,
in the case of each of _(i)_ through _(iii)_ of this _Section 6.13(c)_ in
any material respect; or

 



 

(iv) adversely impacts the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against any
other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the ability of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification or replacement.

 



 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, and instruct the
management of the Company and the Subsidiaries to, in each case, use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer, its Affiliates, their
respective Representatives and the Debt Financing Sources all customary
cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer, its Affiliates, their respective
Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt
Financing (including any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing) and any syndication thereof, including commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) make senior management of the Company and the
Subsidiaries available on reasonable prior notice and at reasonable times,
(ii) participate by phone or otherwise in a reasonable number of meetings (not
to exceed three (3) meetings with respect to the initial syndication of the
Debt Financing), presentations, sessions with rating agencies and due
diligence sessions, including with respect to the initial syndication of the
Debt Financing, (iii) provide reasonable and customary assistance with the
preparation of materials (including projections) for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, confidential information memoranda,
marketing materials and other similar documents for the Debt Financing and
provide reasonable cooperation with the due diligence efforts of any sources
of Debt Financing to the extent reasonable and customary (including executing
customary authorization letters authorizing the distribution of information
about the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective sources of financing
subject to customary confidentiality agreements and arrangements), (iv) to the
extent timely requested, (A) obtain documents reasonably requested by Buyer,
its Affiliates, their respective Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources

Subsidiaries, including customary payoff letters, (B) provide, at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all documentation and other
information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
USA PATRIOT Act, relating to any of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in each
case as reasonably requested by Buyer, its Affiliates, their respective
Representatives or any of the Debt Financing Sources at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and (C) provide, at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a Beneficial Ownership Certification
under 31 C.F.R. 1010.230, in each case as reasonably requested by Buyer, its
Affiliates, their respective Representatives or any of the Debt Financing
Sources at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (v)
furnish Buyer, its Affiliates, their respective Representatives and the Debt
Financing Sources with financial and other pertinent information, including
historical financial statements (and assisting in the

 



     

 

 



 

preparation of pro forma financial statements), regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to consummate the Debt Financing, including
the Required Financial Information, (vi) execute and deliver as of the Closing
any customary pledge and security documents, guarantees, hedging agreements
and other definitive financing documents and other certificates or documents
(other than any solvency certificate), including consents of accountants for
use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing or any
filings by Buyer with the SEC with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
(and any assets and property of the Company and its Subsidiaries) as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, its Affiliates, their respective
Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources and otherwise cooperate to
facilitate the guaranteeing of obligations and the pledging of, granting of
security interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral in
connection with the Debt Financing, (vii) if, at any time prior to Closing,
any of the foregoing information or projections furnished above would, to the
Knowledge of the Company, be incorrect in any material respect if such
information and projections were furnished at such time, supplement such
information and projections so that they are correct in all material respects
under those circumstances, and (viii) take all corporate actions, subject to
the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably necessary or advisable to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be
available as of the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the ongoing business or operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
(2) neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall be required to
commit to take any action or execute any agreement or certificate that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing,
(3) Buyer shall be solely responsible for the contents (other than historical
information of the Company and the Subsidiaries provided by Sellers, the
Company or any Subsidiary) and determination of pro forma financial
information, including pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization or
other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma
financial information, (4) nothing herein shall require any director of the
Company or Adapt Pharma Operations Limited to make, give or execute any
declaration in connection with, or otherwise participate in, any summary
approval procedure which is undertaken for the purposes of section 82 of the
Irish Companies Act 2014 and (5) nothing herein shall require the Company or
any Subsidiary to provide any materials or information the disclosure of which
would, in the Companys good faith and reasonable determination after
consultation with counsel, destroy or compromise attorney-client privilege or
any similar privilege that may be applicable thereto. All such assistance
referred to in this _Section 6.13(d)_ shall be at Buyers written request
with reasonable prior notice (in each case, for which notice by electronic
mail to Sellers Representative shall be sufficient). None of the Company or
any Subsidiary shall be required to, prior to the Closing or with respect to
any event or circumstances occurring or existing prior to the Closing, pay any
commitment fee or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by Buyer as
provided in _Section 6.13(e)_) or incur any other liability or provide or
agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of
the foregoing. All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company, the Subsidiaries and their business obtained by Buyer or its
financing sources pursuant to this section shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such information
may be disclosed to "private side" lenders that agree to customary
confidentiality obligations in connection with syndication efforts.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Company or the Sellers
Representative and receipt of an invoice therefor, reimburse any Seller, the
Company or any Subsidiary for all

 



     

 

 



 

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including any
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any Seller, the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with providing the cooperation required by _Section
6.13(d)_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, the Company, and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing or
their support of the Debt Financing, including any action taken by them in
accordance with _Section 6.13(d)_ (other than to the extent arising from
Fraud on the part of a Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates). Sellers and the Company hereby consent to the use of
each of the logos and other trademarks of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Debt Financing.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.13_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed in any event to condition the obligations of Buyer to effect the
Closing on the receipt of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or any other financing.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall provide the
Sellers Representative with prompt written notice (i) of any material breach
or default by any Debt Financing Source party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt by Buyer of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication,
in each case, from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (1) material
breach or default or the termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter, or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, or (2)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letters or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements related to the
obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to
be funded at Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any reason Buyer believes
in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (after giving effect to
the "market flex" provisions). As soon as reasonably practicable, Buyer shall
provide the Sellers Representative with any information reasonably requested
by the Sellers relating to any circumstance referred to in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

6.14 _Confidentiality_. Sellers acknowledge that the success of the business
of the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing depends upon the
continued preservation of the confidentiality of certain information possessed
by Sellers, that the preservation of the confidentiality of such information
by Sellers, their Affiliates, employees, officers and directors is an
essential premise of the bargain between Sellers and Buyer, and that Buyer
would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this
_Section 6.14_. Accordingly, each Seller hereby agrees that, for a period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is [***] following
the Closing Date ( _provided_ that Confidential Information that constitutes a
trade secret shall remain subject to the terms of this sentence until such
later date on which such Confidential Information no longer constitutes a
trade secret under applicable Law), such Seller shall not, and shall cause its
employees, directors, officers, Affiliates and other representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, without the express prior written consent of Buyer,
(i) disclose any Confidential

Representatives) or (ii) use any Confidential Information, in each case
(clauses (i) and (ii)) other than (1) for the purpose of carrying out Sellers
obligations under this Agreement or any Related Agreement, (2) in connection
Sellers exercise or enforcement of their rights under, or defense against any
claim or allegation made against them pursuant to or in relation to the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (3)
only with respect to Confidential Information of the type described in clause
(A) of the definition of "Confidential Information" that does not constitute
trade secrets for any other permitted purpose contemplated by _Section
6.6(b)_; _provided_ that Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
only disclose Confidential Information to the extent reasonably necessary or
useful in connection with any such other permitted purpose contemplated by
this clause (3). For purposes of this _Section 6.14_, " _Confidential
Information_ " shall mean (A) all information of the Company or any Subsidiary
which is or becomes known to any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates
as a direct or indirect consequence of or through any Sellers or such
Affiliates relationship with or direct or indirect ownership prior to the
Closing of the Company or any Subsidiary, including information that relates
to matters such as trade secrets (including customer preferences and
purchasing histories, know-how, technical data, designs, drawings and
specifications), research and development activities, inventions, new or
prospective lines of business (including analysis and market research relating
to potential expansion of the business), business plans, books and records,
financial, operations or business data, clinical trial or personal data,

the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as they may exist from time to
time and (B) all Information of Buyer and its Affiliates shared pursuant to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the term
"Confidential Information" shall not include any information or portions of

respective Affiliates, including a disclosure in violation of this Agreement
or any other agreement between any Seller or any Affiliate of such Seller, on
the one hand, and the Company or any Subsidiary, on the other hand, or by a
Person who received such information from any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates in violation of any such agreement) or (b) is
subsequently disclosed to by a third party without obligations of
confidentiality with respect thereto. Upon Closing, all "Information" (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall be deemed to constitute
Buyers Information.

 



 

6.15 _Litigation; Regulatory and Manufacturing Updates_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Sellers shall provide (a) written
notice to Buyer of receipt by the Company or any Subsidiary of any written
notice from a third party of (i) any inter partes, post-grant or other similar
proceeding with respect to any Company Registered IP or (ii) any new drug
application, abbreviated new drug application, or other application for
marketing approval that contains a certification under paragraph IV of the
Hatch-Waxman Act, or a comparable certification under Canadian Law, in respect
of any Patent comprising the Company Registered IP, in each case, within five
(5) days after receipt of such notice and, (b) to the extent requested by

6.17 _Cash Matters_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall dividend or otherwise
distribute, or cause to be transferred by dividend or otherwise distributed to

Such distributions or transfers may be effected through one or more share
repurchase transactions, distributions or dividends. After Closing, Buyer
shall, as necessary, cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to be provided
with sufficient funding to discharge their payment obligations, including in
respect of the Contracts listed in _Section 6.16_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

Subsidiaries auditors in connection with the filing of their audit report
along with such financial information with the SEC and the incorporation of
such audit report and financial information into Buyers or its applicable
Affiliates documents to be filed with the SEC. Buyer shall be responsible for
(a) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Sellers, the Company and the

with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

Contract(s)" or "material" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" in _Sections
4.6_ or _4.17_ shall be disregarded for any such purposes).

 



 

(g) The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party (i) to the extent that the applicable Losses were reflected or expressly
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Initial Purchase Price
(including each item in the Final Closing Date Statement) under _Section 2.6_
or (ii) for or in respect of any Specified Liabilities or any Losses incurred,
sustained by or imposed upon any Buyer Indemnified Party comprising or arising
out of any Specified Liability other than any such Losses incurred, sustained
by or imposed upon Buyer in connection with recovering any amounts owed by
Sellers to Buyer under, and not timely paid by Sellers in accordance with,

10.5 _Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification
is sought (and if the Sellers (or any Seller) would be the Indemnifying Party,
such notice shall be given to the Sellers Representative), which notice shall
include a description in reasonable detail of (i) to the extent known, the
basis for, and nature of, such claim, including the facts constituting the
basis for such claim, and (ii) the estimated amount of the Losses that have
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party in connection with such
claim. For purposes of this _Section 10.5_, if the Sellers (or any Seller)
would be the Indemnifying Party, references to the "Indemnifying Party" shall
mean the Sellers Representative.

 



 

(b) In the event that any Action shall be instituted or asserted by any third
party in respect of which payment may be sought under _Section 10.2_ or
_Section 10.3_ (regardless of the limitations set forth in _Section 10.4_)
(each, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly cause
written notice of the assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has
knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the
Indemnifying Party. The failure of the Indemnified Party to give reasonably
prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise
affect the Indemnifying Partys obligations with respect thereto except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses to be indemnified by it
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party may not assume
control of the defense to a Third Party Claim (w) to the extent involving any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (x)
without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.10_, if the Third Party Claim
relates to Taxes or to the Company Intellectual Property or (y) to the extent
relief other than monetary damages is sought and such non-monetary relief, if
granted, would be material to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the claim notice notify the
Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim which relates to any Losses to be indemnified against hereunder, or is
not permitted to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the
proviso to the third

 



     

 

 



 

sentence of this _Section 10.5(b)_, the Indemnified Party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, subject to
the provisions below. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of
any Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party if (A) so requested by the Indemnifying
Party to participate or (B) in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to
the Indemnified Party a material conflict exists between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim
and shall be responsible for the expense of such counsel solely to the extent
of its reasonable and documented fees and expenses. If after assuming the
defense of a Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party determines that it is
not required to provide indemnification therefor, it shall promptly notify the
Indemnified Party, cease to control the defense of such Third Party Claim, and
shall nonetheless be responsible for all costs of defense incurred by it prior
to such notice. In relation to the defense of any Third Party Claim related to
any Company Intellectual Property that the Indemnified Party is controlling,
(1) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate (but not
control) at its own expense and with its own counsel, in any such defense and
(2) the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent practicable, consult in good
faith with the Indemnifying Party regarding all material aspects of such
defense. The parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.5_ to the contrary, (i)
neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the
written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment, decision or order
unless (1) the claimant provides to such other party an unqualified release of
the Indemnified Parties and Indemnifying Parties from all Liability in respect
of such Third Party Claim, (2) such settlement does not involve any injunctive
relief binding upon the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (3) [***]
and (4) such settlement does not involve any admission of liability or
wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim for which the
Indemnifying Party will be fully responsible, provided the Indemnifying Party
has acknowledged responsibility for such indemnification obligation in
writing.

 



 

10.6 _Tax Treatment_. To the extent permitted by Law, the parties agree to
treat all payments made under this _Article X_, under any other indemnity
provision contained in this Agreement, and for any misrepresentations or
breach of warranties or covenants, as adjustments to the Final Initial
Purchase Price and Earn-Out Payments for all Tax purposes.

 



 

10.7 _Remedies_. From and after the Closing, without limiting _Section 9.4_,
the sole and exclusive remedy for any Indemnified Party for any Losses
suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Party under this Agreement shall be
indemnification in accordance with this _Article_

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

 _X_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
herein, including in this _Section 10.7_, shall operate to limit (a) the
rights of any party to seek (i) specific performance or injunctive relief in
the event of a partys failure to comply with its indemnification obligations
hereunder; (ii) equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief), subject to and in accordance with _Section 9.4_ or (iii)
any remedies available to it under applicable Law in the event of Fraud; or
(b) limit any right or remedy any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against any
Seller for any Losses resulting from, or arising out of any breach of any
Related Agreement to which such Seller is a party.

 



 

10.8 _Source of Recovery_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be available to reimburse and
compensate each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses, as a source of
remedy for the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to the indemnification
obligations of Sellers under this _Article X_. All claims for recovery for
any Loss or Losses from the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be made
pursuant to and in accordance with, and be governed by the terms of, this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) If, at any time an Earn-Out Payment is due and payable and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties have made a claim in accordance with this _Article X_ for
Losses (i) related to a Third-Party Claim at a time when the Indemnification
Escrow Amount is not sufficient to provide recourse for all such Losses, Buyer
may retain and not pay to Sellers that portion of the Earn-Out Payment equal
to the amount the Buyer Indemnified Parties reasonably and in good faith
estimate (based upon the amount claimed pursuant to such Third Party Claim and
reasonable defense costs and expenses) to be subject to such indemnification
claim less the amount in the Indemnification Escrow Account that would provide
recourse for such Losses (ii) unrelated to a Third-Party Claim at a time when
the Indemnification Escrow Amount is not sufficient to provide recourse for
all such Losses, [***] ([***] the " _Agreed Deduction_ "). [***], Buyer may
retain and not pay to Sellers that portion of such Earn-Out Payment that is
equal to the Agreed Deduction less the amount in the Indemnification Escrow
Account that would provide recourse for such Losses. [***].

 



 

(c) If the finally determined amount of Losses for such indemnification claim
set forth in the foregoing clause (b) is less than the amount by which such
Earn-Out Payment was reduced and retained by Buyer in accordance with the
foregoing clause (b), then Buyer shall promptly pay the difference to the
Sellers for distribution pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_, together with interest
thereon accruing daily beginning on the day after the date on which such Earn-
Out Payment was due until the day prior to the date on which such difference
is paid, at the interest rate set forth in _Section 2.8(b)_. If the finally
determined amount of Losses for such indemnification claim set forth in the
foregoing clause (b) exceeds the amount by which such Earn-Out Payment was
reduced and retained for such claim, then such Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
continue to be entitled to indemnification for the amount of such excess
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
subject to the limitations contained herein, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
agree to seek recourse for any Losses to be indemnified by Sellers under this
_Article X_ in the following order: (i) first, against the Indemnification
Escrow Amount, to the extent the Indemnification Escrow Account has available
funds therein; (ii) second, in accordance with the Buyer Indemnified Parties
set-off rights against Earn-Out Payments in accordance with the terms and
conditions of _Section 10.8(b)_ and _Section 10.8(c)_; and (iii) third,
directly against the Sellers.

 



 

10.9 _No Right of Contribution_. No Seller shall have any right of
contribution against the Company with respect to any breach by the Company of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

 



 

10.10 _No Circular Recovery_. Each Seller hereby agrees that it will not make
any claim for indemnification against Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary by
reason of the fact that such Seller was a controlling Person, director,
employee or Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary or was serving as
such for another Person at the request of a Seller, the Company or Subsidiary
(whether such claim is for Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such
claim is pursuant to any statute, organizational document, contractual
obligation or otherwise) with respect to any claim brought by a Buyer
Indemnified Party against any Seller relating to this Agreement, any Related
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. With
respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party against any Seller
relating to this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, each Seller expressly waives any right of
subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against
the Sellers or any Subsidiary with respect to any amounts owed by such Seller
pursuant to this _Article X_.

 



 

10.11 _Release of Indemnification Escrow Account_. Subject to the further
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and _Article X_, on the date
that is [***] and one day after the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative
and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
release any remaining funds on deposit in the Indemnification Escrow Account
on such date, _minus_ the aggregate amount of any claims (each, a " _Pending
Claim_ ") asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party under and in accordance with
this _Article X_ that are made prior to the applicable survival period set
forth in _Section 10.1_ and that have not been resolved (the " _Pending Claim
Reserve_ "). A Pending Claim will remain unresolved until it is resolved by
joint written instructions or a final determination. The portion of Pending
Claim Reserve associated with each Pending Claim shall remain in escrow until
the resolution of the applicable claim to which such reserve relates. To the
extent such pending claim or claims are resolved in favor of Buyer Indemnified
Parties, the portion of the Pending Claim Reserve sufficient to satisfy such
claim or claims shall be paid to Buyer, with any amount remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Account after such payment being released to the
Sellers. All payments to Sellers under _Sections 10.11_ are subject to
reduction as and to the extent set forth in _Section 6.16(a)_.

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been

10.12 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, from and after the Closing, except in connection with any claim for
Fraud or to the extent recovered by a third party in a Third Party Claim, in
no event shall Buyer, the Sellers, the Sellers Representative or any other
Person be liable for any special, exemplary, multiple or punitive damages as a
result of or in connection with the execution, delivery or performance (or
failure to perform) of this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any document,
certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

10.13 _Duty to Mitigate_. The Indemnifying Party shall have no liability under
any provision of this Agreement for any Losses caused solely by actions of any
Indemnified Party taken after the Closing. The Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Losses in
connection with any matter with respect to which it is entitled to be held
harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this _Article
X_, including taking commercially reasonable measures to attempt to recover
any insurance proceeds available to offset such Losses under insurance
policies maintained by the Indemnified Party. In the event that an insurance
or other recovery is actually and finally received by any Indemnified Party
with respect to any Loss for which any such Indemnified Party has theretofore
been indemnified hereunder, then such Indemnified Party will promptly pay over
the aggregate amount of the recovery to the applicable Indemnifying Party.

essence of each and every covenant, agreement and obligation in this
Agreement. Neither Sellers or the Company, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the
other hand, shall be deemed to be in breach of any covenant contained in this
Agreement if such partys deemed breach is the result of any action or
inaction on the part of the other.

 



 

11.6 _Applicable Law_. THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF AGAINST
ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING

consent of the Sellers Representative; except that without obtaining such

assignment); _provided_ that (i) no such assignee shall have greater rights
than Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) Sellers shall be able to assert against
any such assignee all claims and defenses that could be asserted against Buyer

Schedule are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. This
Agreement, the Related Agreements and the New HR Agreements set forth the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the

OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE

 



     

 

 



 

THEREOF AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE), THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY (A) AGREE THAT ANY LITIGATION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LEGAL ACTION SHALL

OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS

DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE).
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

11.14 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The disclosures in the Company Disclosure
Schedule in a given section of the Company Disclosure Schedule are to be taken
as relating to the representations and warranties of Sellers and the Company
in other sections in the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other sections, notwithstanding the fact that the Company

 



     

 

 



 

Disclosure Schedule is arranged by sections corresponding to the sections in
this Agreement or that a particular section of this Agreement makes reference
to a specific section of the Company Disclosure Schedule and notwithstanding
that a particular representation and warranty may not make a reference to the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The inclusion of information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to any Seller or the Company or any Subsidiary. In
addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended
to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of
the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Schedule
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter,
or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of business,
and no party shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any such
items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have
the right to supplement, modify or update the Company Disclosure Schedule with
any matter hereafter arising or for which the Company or Sellers obtain
knowledge after the date hereof to ensure the correctness thereof. Any such
supplements, modifications and updates shall be given effect for purposes of
_Article VII_ or _Article X_.

 



 

11.15 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 



 

11.16 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the language shall be construed as mutually
chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Unless the context expressly
otherwise provides, the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision

 



     

 

 



 

of this Agreement. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement. Any capitalized
term used in any schedule or exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined
therein shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in this Agreement. Where
this Agreement states that a party hereto "shall," "will" or "must" perform in
some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means such party is legally
obligated to do so in accordance with this Agreement. References to a
particular Law shall mean such Law as amended or otherwise in effect as of the
relevant time of determination and shall include all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign
statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. All dollar
amounts in this agreement refer to United States currency. References to any
contract or agreement mean such contract or agreement as amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified and in effect as of the relevant time of determination.
The parties hereto have been represented by sophisticated counsel in the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and have participated jointly in
the drafting of this Agreement and, therefore, irrevocably waive the
application of any Law, holding or rule of construction providing that
ambiguities in an agreement will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement.

 



 

11.17 _Retention of Advisors_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or
in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, each Seller and its
shareholders or owners (if applicable) shall have the right, at their
election, to retain [***] to represent them in such matter, even if such
representation shall be adverse to Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries.
Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries, for themselves and for their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably consent to
any such representation in any such matter. Buyer, the Company and the
Subsidiaries, for themselves and for their respective Affiliates, successors
and assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any actual or potential conflict arising
from any such representation in the event of: (a) any adversity between the
interests of any Seller and its shareholders or owners, on the one hand, and
Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in any such
matter; or (b) any communication between [***] and the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates or employees, whether privileged
or not, or any other information known to such counsel, by reason of such
counsels representation of any of the Company or the Subsidiaries prior to
Closing.

 



 

11.18 _Protected Communication_. The parties to this Agreement agree that,
immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further action (a)
all right, title and interest of the Company and any Subsidiary in and to all
Protected Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in
Sellers and their successors in interest, and (b) any and all protections from
disclosure, including attorney-client privileges and work product protections,
associated with or arising from any Protected Communications that would have
been exercisable by the Company or any Subsidiary shall thereupon be vested
exclusively in Sellers and their successors in interest and shall be exercised
or waived solely as directed by Sellers or their successors in interest;
_provided_

  *** Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential treatment has been
requested with respect to the omitted portions.

 



     

 

 



 

that Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may assert such protection
in a dispute with a third party after the Closing Date. None of Buyer, the
Company, the Subsidiaries or any Person acting on any of their behalf shall,
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, assert
(other than as permitted by preceding sentence) or waive or attempt to assert
(other than as permitted by the preceding sentence) or waive any such
protection against disclosure, including the attorney-client privilege or work
product protection, or to discover, obtain, use or disclose or attempt to
discover, obtain, use or disclose any Protected Communications in any manner,
including in connection with any dispute or legal proceeding relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, the events and negotiations leading to this
Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall neither prohibit Buyer from seeking
proper discovery of such documents nor Sellers from asserting that such
documents are not discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney-client
privileges and work product protections have attached thereto. Anything to the
contrary notwithstanding, Sellers and their successors in interest shall have
the right at any time prior to or following the Closing to remove, erase,
delete, disable, copy or otherwise deal with any Protected Communications in
whatever way they desire, and, until the date that is seven (7) years
following the Closing Date and subject to the procedures set forth in _Section
6.6(b)_, Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall provide full access to
all Protected Communications in their possession or within their direct or
indirect control and shall provide reasonable assistance at the expense of the
Person requesting such assistance in order to give full force and effect to
the rights of each Seller and its successors in interest hereunder.

 



 

11.19 _No Waiver of Privilege, Protection from Disclosure or Use_. The parties
hereto understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including the
provisions of _Section 11.17_ and _Section 11.18_ regarding the assertions
of protection from disclosure and use, privilege and conflicts of interest,
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege or
other protection from disclosure or use. The relevant parties have undertaken
reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of Protected Communications.
Notwithstanding those efforts, the parties understand and agree that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could result
in the inadvertent disclosure of information that may be confidential,
eligible to be subject to a claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from
disclosure. The parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of
information that may be confidential, subject to a claim of privilege, or
otherwise protected from disclosure will not constitute a waiver of or
otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality, privilege, or protection
from disclosure, including with respect to information involving or concerning
the same subject matter as the disclosed information. The parties agree to use
reasonable best efforts to return any inadvertently disclosed information to
the disclosing party promptly upon becoming aware of its existence. The
parties further agree that promptly after the return of any inadvertently
disclosed information, the party returning such information shall destroy any
and all copies, summaries, descriptions or notes of such inadvertently
disclosed information, including electronic versions thereof, and all portions
of larger documents or communications that contain such copies, summaries,
descriptions or notes.

 



 

11.20 _Authority and Rights of the Sellers  Representative; Limitations on
Liability_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller, by virtue of the execution of this Agreement, irrevocably
constitutes and appoints the Sellers Representative (and by execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Sellers Representative accepts such
appointment) as its agent and attorney-in-fact for and on

 



     

 

 



 

behalf of such Seller with full power of substitution, to act in the same,
place and stead of such Seller with respect to the matters contemplated by
_Section 11.20(b)_ hereof.

 



 

(b) The Sellers Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary or appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to him under this
Agreement and the Related Agreements or any other document contemplated
hereby, including (i) as applicable, receiving, holding and distributing
amounts payable to Sellers and paying any associated costs and expenses of the
transactions hereunder required to be paid by Sellers; (ii) giving and
receiving all notices permitted or required by this Agreement and acting on
the Sellers behalf hereunder for all purposes specified herein; (iii)
delivering the certificates or instruments of transfer for the Purchased
Shares endorsed or executed by the Sellers to the Buyer at Closing and any and
all assignments relating thereto; (iv) subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 11.1_ agreeing with the Buyer as to any amendments to this Agreement
which the Sellers Representative may deem necessary or advisable, including
the extension of time in which to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and the waiver of any closing conditions; (v) employing legal
counsel on behalf of the Sellers; (vi) paying any legal, accounting,
investment banking, and any other fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers
Representative in consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (vii) defending or settling claims arising under this Agreement;
and (viii) making, executing, acknowledging, and delivering all such
contracts, orders, receipts, notices, requests, instructions, certificates,
letters, and other writings, and in general doing all things and taking all
actions which the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, may
consider necessary or proper in connection with or to carry out the terms of
this Agreement, as fully as if such Sellers were personally present and acting
provided. All actions, notices, communications and determinations by the
Sellers Representative to carry out such functions shall conclusively be
deemed to have been authorized by, and shall be binding upon, the Sellers.
Neither the Sellers Representative nor any of his Representatives will have
any liability to the Sellers with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken by the Sellers Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates in connection
therewith). The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons. All actions, decisions, instructions and notices of the Sellers
Representative taken, made or provided in accordance with this Agreement and
Related Agreements shall be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers to the
same extent as if such Sellers had taken such action, made such decision or
provided or received such instruction or notice directly, and no Seller shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer, the Company, the
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates and Representatives may rely
(without investigation) upon any representation or action taken by the
Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Related
Agreements, all certificates, documents or instruments delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as
being authorized by the Sellers, and no Person shall have any cause of action
against Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates
and Representatives and they are hereby relieved from any liabilities to any
Person for any action taken by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
in reliance upon any such decision, consent, instruction, representation or
action of the Sellers Representative.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) The Sellers Representative shall have the right to recover from each
Seller (severally), such Sellers pro rata share of the Sellers
Representatives documented reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the
performance of its duties hereunder, including those resulting from the
employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other advisors and
agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and settlement
of any disputes arising under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Sellers Representative may resign for any reason or no reason, at any
time. If the Sellers Representative resigns, then a replacement Sellers
Representative shall be designated by the Sellers (or their successors-in-
interest) having a majority of the ownership percentage of the share capital
of the Company. Any such replacement Sellers Representative will have the
full power and authority of the Sellers Representative hereunder.

 



 

(e) The relationship between the Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and
each Seller, on the other hand, created herein shall not be construed as a
joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the Sellers
Representative and such Seller for any purpose of Federal or state applicable
Law, including without limitation, Federal or Income Tax purposes. Neither the
Sellers Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other
duty to any Seller.

 



 

11.21 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Sources_. Subject to the rights of the
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter related thereto under
the terms thereof, (i) none of the Company, any Subsidiary, any Seller or any
Seller Related Person shall have any right, claim or recourse whatsoever,
whether at law or equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, against the Debt Financing Sources and each such Person agrees not to
commence (and, if commenced, agrees to dismiss or terminate) an legal
proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (ii) the Debt Financing Sources shall not have any obligations or
liabilities to the Company, any Subsidiary, any Seller or any Seller Related
Person and all such obligations and liabilities, if any, are hereby
irrevocably waived, and (iii) the Debt Financing Sources shall not be liable
to the Company, any Subsidiary, any Seller or any Seller Related Person for
any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a
tortious nature. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 11.21_
is intended to limit or modify any obligations or liabilities the Debt
Financing Sources may have toward the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter related thereto.

 



 

11.22 _Mutual Release_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller, on its own behalf and, to the extent of its legal authority,
on behalf of its successors, assigns, executors and any other Person claiming
by, through or under any of the foregoing (each, a " _Seller Releasing Party_
" and collectively, the " _Seller Releasing Parties_ "), does hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably release, waive and forever discharge,
effective as of the Closing, the Company, the Subsidiaries and each of their
respective past and present directors, officers, managers, employees, agents,
predecessors, successors, assigns, stockholders, members, partners, insurers
and Affiliates (the " _Company Released Parties_ "), from any and all claims,
demands, damages, judgments, decisions, orders, causes of action and
Liabilities of any nature

 



       
 

 



 

whatsoever, whether or not known, suspected or claimed, arising directly or
indirectly from any act, omission, event or transaction occurring (or any
circumstances existing) on or prior to the Closing with respect to the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries arising out of or relating to such Seller Releasing
Partys capacity as a current or former stockholder or other equity holder of
the Company, whether pursuant to the Company Released Parties Organizational
Documents, applicable Law, Contract or otherwise, or any Contract or other
arrangement (excluding this Agreement and the Related Agreements) entered into
or established prior to the Closing, including any Contracts required to be
disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule and any shareholder agreements,
partnership agreements or investor agreements, in all cases whether or not
known, suspected or claimed, arising directly or indirectly from any act,
omission, event or transaction occurring (or any circumstances existing) on or
prior to the Closing (the " _Seller Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section
11.22(a)_ shall not constitute a release or waiver of any right of any past or
present officers and directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries under
_Section 6.9_ or referred to in, or pursuant to any agreement, instrument,
document or policy referred to in _Section 6.9_, which rights shall not in
any event, for clarity, comprise "Seller Released Claims". Each Seller
Releasing Party understands that this is a full and final general release of
all claims, demands, damages, judgments, decisions, orders, causes of action
and Liabilities comprising Seller Released Claims of any nature whatsoever
except as expressly stated above, whether or not known, suspected or claimed,
that could have been asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding against the
Company Released Parties. Each Seller Releasing Party represents and warrants
to the Company Released Parties that (a) it has not voluntarily or
involuntarily assigned, conveyed or otherwise transferred, or purported to
assign, convey or otherwise transfer, to any Person any Seller Released Claims
released by such Seller Releasing Party and (b) there are no Liens on or
against any of the Seller Released Claims released by such Seller Releasing
Party. Each Seller acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide
substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS
WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT
THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Each Seller
acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a Person from
waiving claims which it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, the
Sellers agree that, effective as of the Closing, the Sellers (on behalf of the
Seller Releasing Parties) shall be deemed to waive any such provision. Each
Seller, on behalf of himself, herself, itself and the other Seller Releasing
Parties, irrevocably covenants not to, directly or indirectly, sue, or
commence, knowingly aid or prosecute or cause to be commenced, knowingly aided
or prosecuted any Action, or authorize any other Person to commence or
prosecute any Action, against any of the Company Released Parties in respect
of any Seller Released Claim.

 



 

(b) Buyer, on its own behalf and, to the extent of its legal authority, on
behalf of its current and future Affiliates, including the Company and the
Subsidiaries, and Buyers and such Affiliates respective successors, assigns,
executors and any other Person claiming by, through or under any of the
foregoing (each, a " _Buyer Releasing Party_ " and collectively, the " _Buyer
Releasing Parties_ "), does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably release,
waive and forever discharge, effective as of the Closing, each Seller and each
of their respective past and present directors, officers, managers, employees,
agents, predecessors, successors, assigns, stockholders, members, partners,
insurers and Affiliates (the " _Seller Released Parties_ "), from any and all
claims, demands, damages, judgments, decisions, orders, causes of action and
Liabilities of any nature whatsoever,

 



     

 

 



 

whether or not known, suspected or claimed, arising directly or indirectly
from any act, omission, event or transaction occurring (or any circumstances
existing) on or prior to the Closing with respect to the organization,
management or operation of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
whether pursuant to the Seller Released Parties Organizational Documents,
applicable Law, Contract or otherwise, or any Contract or other arrangement
(excluding this Agreement and the Related Agreements) entered into or
established prior to the Closing, including any Contracts required to be
disclosed on the Company Disclosure Schedule and any shareholder agreements,
partnership agreements or investor agreements, in all cases whether or not
known, suspected or claimed, arising directly or indirectly from any act,
omission, event or transaction occurring (or any circumstances existing) on or
prior to the Closing (the " _Buyer Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , that this
_Section 11.22(b)_ shall not constitute a release or waiver of any rights of
any Buyer Releasing Party under this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any
certificate delivered hereunder of thereunder or any claim for Fraud, which
rights shall, for clarity, not comprise "Buyer Released Claims". Each Buyer
Releasing Party understands that this is a full and final general release of
all claims, demands, damages, judgments, decisions, orders, causes of action
and Liabilities comprising Buyer Released Claims of any nature whatsoever
except as expressly stated above, whether or not known, suspected or claimed,
that could have been asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding against the
Seller Released Parties. Each Buyer Releasing Party represents and warrants to
the Seller Released Parties that (a) it has not voluntarily or involuntarily
assigned, conveyed or otherwise transferred, or purported to assign, convey or
otherwise transfer, to any Person any Buyer Released Claims released by such
Buyer Releasing Party and (b) there are no Liens on or against any of the
Buyer Released Claims released by such Buyer Releasing Party. Buyer
acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide substantially the following:
"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Buyer acknowledges that such provisions are
designed to protect a Person from waiving claims which it does not know exist
or may exist. Nonetheless, Buyer agrees that, effective as of the Closing,
Buyer (on behalf of the Buyer Releasing Parties) shall be deemed to waive any
such provision. Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Releasing
Parties, irrevocably covenants not to, directly or indirectly, sue, or
commence, knowingly aid or prosecute or cause to be commenced, knowingly aided
or prosecuted any Action, or authorize any other Person to commence or
prosecute any Action, against any of the Seller Released Parties in respect of
any Buyer Released Claim.
