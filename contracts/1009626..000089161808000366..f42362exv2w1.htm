executed debt commitment letter dated July&nbsp;21, 2008, related term sheets and the exhibits attached
thereto, from Bank of America N.A. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and certain of their
respective affiliates (collectively, the &#147;<B>Debt Commitment Letter</B>&#148;), pursuant to which, on the terms
and subject to conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, certain lenders have committed to provide
Parent with loans in the amounts described in the Debt Commitment Letter (the &#147;<B>Debt Financing</B>&#148;).
As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to Parent&#146;s Knowledge, the other parties thereto. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any material respect. As of the date
of this Agreement, Parent is not in material breach of any of its covenants set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent has paid any and all commitment or other fees payable by it under the
Debt Commitment Letter that are due as of the date of this Agreement. Except for side letters,
agreements, arrangements or understandings that would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair the validity of the Debt Commitment Letter or the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger
or materially decrease the amount of financing expected to be provided under the Debt Commitment
Letter, there are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings with any
lender relating to the Debt Financing to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates is a
party as of the date of this Agreement. Subject to its terms and conditions, the Debt Financing,
if and when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, will, when taken together with
funds (including funds on hand) otherwise available to Parent and, assuming the accuracy of the
Company&#146;s representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the Company&#146;s compliance
with its covenants and obligations set forth in this Agreement, funds (including funds on hand)
otherwise available to the Acquired Corporations, provide Parent with financing on the Closing Date
sufficient to pay all cash amounts required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement in connection with the Merger, together with any fees and expenses of or payable by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger and the Debt Financing
on the Closing Date. Assuming that the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Financing Letter, and assuming the accuracy of the Company&#146;s representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement and the Company&#146;s compliance with its covenants and
obligations set forth in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub will require any additional debt or financing
other than as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the obligations of the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter to make the Debt Financing available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the
terms of the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions, other than those set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
Company&#146;s representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the Company&#146;s compliance
with its covenants and obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent (i)&nbsp;is not aware of any fact
or occurrence that makes the Specified Representations (as that term is defined in Annex III to the
Debt Commitment Letter) inaccurate in any material respect, (ii)
&nbsp;has no reason to believe that it
will be unable to comply on a timely basis with any covenant, or satisfy on a timely basis any
condition, contained in the Debt Commitment Letter required to be complied with or satisfied by
Parent or its affiliates, and (iii)&nbsp;has no reason to believe that any portion of the Debt Financing

contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured considering all financing
