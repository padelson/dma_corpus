AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of July 21, 2008, by and among: Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); Falcon Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and Foundry Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

  

Recitals

   

 A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

  

 B. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger.

  

 C. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger to be consummated, a stockholder of the Company is executing a voting agreement in favor of Parent concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Voting Agreement").

  

Agreement

   

 The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  

 Section 1\. Description of Transaction

  

 1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

   

 1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

   

 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward Kronish llp, 3175 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, at 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the later of (a) the date that is ten business days after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 6.6(b) and 7.5, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions) and (b) October 27, 2008 or such earlier date as Parent may designate in writing (the later of the date referred to in clause "(a)" of this sentence and the date referred to in clause "(b)" of this sentence being referred to as the "Designated Date"), or on such other date or at such other time or location as

    ##### 

  

    

Parent and the Company may mutually designate in writing; _provided, however_
, that if there exists an uncured Financing Failure on the Designated Date
and such Financing Failure impedes the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
obtain the Debt Financing and consummate the Merger on the Designated Date,
then (without limiting any right the Company may have to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) or, if applicable under the
circumstances, Section 8.1(b)): (i) the Closing shall be postponed until the
second business day after the date on which such Financing Failure is
cured; (ii) the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall remain
subject to the continued satisfaction or waiver, as of the time of the
Closing, of each of the conditions set forth in Section 6; and (iii) the
obligation of the Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall remain subject to the continued
satisfaction or waiver, as of the time of the Closing, of each of the
conditions set forth in Section 7\. The date on which the Closing actually
takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company in connection
with the Closing and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following
the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as may be specified in such certificate of merger with the
written consent of Parent and the Company (the time as of which the Merger
becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective Time"). 

   

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time: 

    

 (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to conform to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Foundry Networks, Inc." and (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.5; 

   

 (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) Article I of the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to provide that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be Foundry Networks, Inc. and (ii) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.5; and 

   

 (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

 

  

 1.5 Conversion of Shares.

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

  

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this Section 1.5(a) and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c), 1.5(d) and 1.8, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive: (A) 0.0907 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"); and (B) $18.50 in cash (the "Per Share Cash Amount"); and

  

 (iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 (b) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Per Share Cash Amount and the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by Parent during such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the Exchange Ratio (but not the Per Share Cash Amount) shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

   

 (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has any rights, then (except to the extent provided in

    ##### 

  

    

any binding agreement between the Company and the holder thereof and except
to the extent Parent otherwise elects): (i) the Merger Consideration
delivered in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also
be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition; (ii) the certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock included in such Merger Consideration may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends and need not be delivered until such time as such
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or otherwise
terminates; and (iii) the cash consideration included in such Merger
Consideration need not be paid until such time as such repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or otherwise terminates. The
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase
agreement or other Contract. 

   

 (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date the Merger becomes effective. 

   

 1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.7. 

  

 1.7 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint Wells Fargo Shareowner Services or another institution reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock: (i) subject to Sections 1.5(c) and 1.8, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5; and (ii) subject to Sections 1.5(c) and 1.8, cash sufficient to make payments of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5 (including payments to be made in lieu of fractional shares). The shares of Parent 

    ##### 

  

    

Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together
with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent
with respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange
Fund." 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) subject to Section 1.5(c), the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.5. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in customary amount) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. 

   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to receive: (i) on the date of such surrender, all such dividends and distributions having a payment date prior to the date of such surrender, without interest; and (ii) on the payment date thereof, all such dividends and distributions having a payment date after the date of such surrender, without interest). 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration. 

    #####

Parent has delivered to the Company an accurate and complete copy of an executed debt commitment letter dated July 21, 2008, related term sheets and the exhibits attached thereto, from Bank of America N.A. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and certain of their respective affiliates (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, certain lenders have committed to provide Parent with loans in the amounts described in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Debt Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to Parents Knowledge, the other parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any material respect. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in material breach of any of its covenants set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent has paid any and all commitment or other fees payable by it under the Debt Commitment Letter that are due as of the date of this Agreement. Except for side letters, agreements, arrangements or understandings that would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the validity of the Debt Commitment Letter or the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or materially decrease the amount of financing expected to be provided under the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings with any lender relating to the Debt Financing to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates is a party as of the date of this Agreement.

As of the date of this Agreement, the obligations of the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter to make the Debt Financing available to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any conditions, other than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and the Companys compliance with its covenants and obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent (i) is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes the Specified Representations (as that term is defined in Annex III to the Debt Commitment Letter) inaccurate in any material respect, (ii)  has no reason to believe that it will be unable to comply on a timely basis with any covenant, or satisfy on a timely basis any condition, contained in the Debt Commitment Letter required to be complied with or satisfied by Parent or its affiliates, and (iii) has no reason to believe that any portion of the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby will not be

##### 

 

  

made available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Subject to
Sections 1.3, 8.1 and 8.3(f), in no event shall the receipt of the Debt
Financing by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates be a
condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder. 

   

 3.7 Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent or Merger Sub.

 3.8 Disclosure. None of the information to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 Registration Statement will, at the time the Form S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 (i) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, provided that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice that it is furnishing such nonpublic information to such Person, (B) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such Person and such Persons Representatives on the Companys behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any such

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and
agrees that any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of any of the Acquired
Corporations, whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on
behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations, shall be deemed to constitute
a breach of this Section 4.3 by the Company. 

   

 (c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed with respect to: (i) the status of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; and (ii) the status and terms of any material modification or proposed material modification thereto.

 (e) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has any rights, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced at the request of Parent. The Company also shall promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality or similar agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or a possible equity investment in any Acquired Corporation to return to the Acquired Corporations, or, alternatively, to destroy and certify to the Company the destruction of, all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations.

Parent shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent that may be required or reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. If any event relating to Parent or its Subsidiaries occurs, or if Parent becomes aware of any information, that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, then Parent shall promptly inform the Company thereof and shall cooperate with the Company in filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC.

Neither Parent nor the Company shall make or file any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 Registration Statement without the approval of the other party (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the extent such amendment or supplement is required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent shall advise the Company promptly after it 

   ##### 

  

    

receives notice of the Form S-4 Registration Statement being declared
effective, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension
of the qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. 

  

 (b) Subject to their respective obligations to comply with all disclosure-related and other applicable Legal Requirements, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Form S-4 Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to cause the Form S-4 Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger will (to the extent required) be registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the securities laws of every jurisdiction of the United States in which any registered holder of Company Common Stock has an address of record on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided, however,_ that Parent shall not be required: (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified; or (ii) to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction. 

  

 5.2 Company Stockholders Meeting. 

   

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"). The Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company, subject to the approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the Company (A) has unanimously determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and (B) unanimously recommends that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting (the unanimous determination that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and the unanimous recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement being collectively referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"); and (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw the Company Board Recommendation or to modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall be adopted or proposed (it being understood that the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent if it shall no longer be unanimous). The 

   ##### 

  

    

Company shall ensure that the Prospectus/Proxy Statement includes the opinion
of the financial advisor referred to in Section 2.24. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent: 

   

 (i) if: (A) an unsolicited, bona fide, written offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such unsolicited, bona fide, written offer was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a material breach by any Acquired Corporation of (or any action inconsistent with) this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any "standstill" or similar agreement under which any Acquired Corporation has any rights or obligations; (C) the Company provides Parent, at least two business days prior to any meeting of the Companys board of directors at which such board of directors will consider and determine whether such offer is a Superior Offer, with a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of the offer that is the basis of the potential action by the board of directors (including a copy of any draft definitive agreement relating to such offer to the extent such a draft definitive agreement exists) and the identity of the Person making such offer; (D) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of its financial advisor, that such offer constitutes a Superior Offer; (E) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to so withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (F) the Company Board Recommendation is not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent at any time within the period of five business days after Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Companys board of directors has determined that such offer is a Superior Offer and that the Companys board of directors has determined that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in light of such Superior Offer would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (G) during such five business day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to constitute a Superior Offer no longer constitutes a Superior Offer or that no withdrawal or modification to the Company Board Recommendation is required as a result of such offer; and (H) at the end of such five business day period, such offer has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Offer and the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would continue to be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements in light of such Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(G)" or otherwise); or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) if: (A) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material development or material change in circumstances that relates to the Acquired Corporations but does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal (any such material development or material change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to as an "Intervening Event"); (B) no Acquired Corporation, and no Representative of any Acquired Corporation, had Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that such Intervening Event was reasonably likely to occur or arise after the date of this Agreement; (C) the Company provides Parent, at least two business days prior to any meeting of the Companys board of directors at which such board of directors will consider and determine whether such Intervening Event may require the Company to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, with a written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such meeting and a description of such Intervening Event; (D) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure to so withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (E) the Company Board Recommendation is not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent at any time within the period of five business days after Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Companys board of directors has determined that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in light of such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (F) during such five business day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that no withdrawal or modification to the Company Board Recommendation is legally required as a result of such Intervening Event; and (G) at the end of such five business day period, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would still be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements in light of such Intervening Event (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(F)" or otherwise). 

 

The Company shall ensure that any withdrawal or modification of the Company
Board Recommendation: (1) shall not affect the validity of the original
approval of this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or any other
approval of the Companys board of directors; and (2) shall not have
the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Voting
Agreement. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the terms of Section 5.2(a), if on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (the "Company Meeting Original Date"), the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to adopt this Agreement, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to be postponed or adjourned to a date that is the sooner of 20 business days after the Company Meeting Original Date and two business days 

   ##### 

  

    

prior to the End Date (as defined in Section 8.1(b)), or to such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually determine. 

  

 (e) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, by any Intervening Event or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation. 

  

 5.3 Stock Options, RSUs and ESPP. 

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, other than the Identified Company Options (as defined in Section 5.3(b)), shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent, at Parents option, either: (i) assuming such Company Option; or (ii) replacing such Company Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Company Option; _provided, however,_ that Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent. The "Conversion Ratio" shall be equal to the sum of (1) the Exchange Ratio; _plus_ (2) the fraction having a numerator equal to the Per Share Cash Amount and having a denominator equal to the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for each of the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Parent Stock Price"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each unexercised Identified Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested) to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the holder of each such Identified Company Option shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Identified Company Option immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to: (i) the sum of (A) the Per Share Cash Amount _plus_ (B) an amount equal to the _product_ of the Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ the Average Parent Stock Price (such sum being referred to as the "Gross Cash Amount"); _minus_ (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Identified Company Option (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to any such Identified Company Option equals or exceeds the Gross Cash Amount, then the amount payable under this Section 5.3(b) with respect to such Identified Company Option shall be zero). Each holder of an outstanding Identified Company Option cancelled as provided in this Section 5.3(b) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration (if any) specified in this Section 5.3(b), without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this Section 5.3(b) to be paid promptly following the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Identified Company Option" shall mean a Company Option identified by Parent prior to the Effective Time that is held by: (1) any member of the board of directors of the Company; (2) any of the individuals listed on Schedule 5.4(b) who may be designated by Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time as a holder of Identified Company Options prior to the Effective Time; or (3) any other Company Associate mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company in writing. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, other than the Identified Company RSUs (as defined in Section 5.3(d)), shall be converted into and become a right to be issued Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent, at Parents option, either: (i) assuming such Company RSU; or (ii) replacing such Company RSU by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement right to be issued Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Equity Plan and the terms of the award agreement by which such Company RSU is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company RSUs assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into rights to be issued Parent Common Stock upon settlement of such assumed or replaced Company RSUs. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Company RSU assumed or replaced by Parent will represent a right to be issued solely shares of Parent Common Stock upon settlement thereof; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company RSU assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by _multiplying_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _by_ the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (C) subject to the terms of the award agreement by which such Company RSU is evidenced, any restriction on the issuance of shares under any Company RSU assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company RSU shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Company RSU; _provided, however,_ that Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the 

   ##### 

  

    

authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Company RSU assumed or replaced by
Parent. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each Identified Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested) to be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof the holder of each such Identified Company RSU shall be granted the right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Identified Company RSU immediately prior to such cancellation, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to the Gross Cash Amount. Each holder of an outstanding Identified Company RSU cancelled as provided in this Section 5.3(d) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration specified in this Section 5.3(d), without interest. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this Section 5.3(d) to be paid promptly following the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, an "Identified Company RSU" shall mean each Company RSU identified by Parent prior to the Effective Time that is held by: (1) any member of the board of directors of the Company; (2) any of the individuals listed on Schedule 5.4(b) who may be designated by Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time as a holder of Identified Company RSUs; or (3) any other Company Associate mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company in writing. 

  

 (e) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than 15 business days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options and Company RSUs assumed or replaced by Parent in accordance with Sections 5.3(a) and 5.3(c), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such options or restricted stock units remain outstanding. 

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, if Parent determines that it desires to do so, Parent may assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such Company Equity Plan into any equity incentive plan of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any Company Equity Plan, then, under such Company Equity Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Plan as of the Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of Company Options and Company RSUs that are assumed or replaced by Parent pursuant to Sections 5.3(a) and 5.3(c)), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Equity Plan. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions 

   ##### 

  

    

of this Section 5.3 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
holders of Company Options and Company RSUs have no rights with respect
thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 5.3. 

  

 (h) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, in its sole discretion, elect to either (x) assume or replace the Company ESPP Options in accordance with Section 5.3(h)(i), or (y) cause the Company ESPP to be terminated prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 5.3(h)(ii). Parent may make different elections with respect to the Company ESPP as it applies to participants in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, as Parent, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Parent shall notify the Company of its election no less than fifteen days prior to the Closing. 

  

 (i) If Parent elects to assume or replace the Company ESPP Options, at the Effective Time, each Company ESPP Option under the Company ESPP that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and for which a Company ESPP Offering Period has not expired shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent, at Parents option, either: (A) assuming such Company ESPP Option; or (B) replacing such Company ESPP Option by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement stock option to purchase Parent Common Stock in replacement therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) and the terms of the Company ESPP Subscription Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) of each Company Associate who is participating in the Company ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company ESPP Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options with respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time: (1) each Company ESPP Option assumed or replaced by Parent will be automatically exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (2) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company ESPP Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the Company ESPP Contributions of each participant in the Company ESPP as of the applicable Company ESPP Purchase Date by the per share exercise price determined pursuant to clause "(3)" of this sentence, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (3) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company ESPP Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined to be the lower of (x) 85% of the Company ESPP Offering Date Fair Market Value divided by the Conversion Ratio, rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, and (y) 85% of the Parent Common Stock Fair Market Value on the Company ESPP Purchase Date, rounding the exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) any restriction on a Company ESPP Option, as set forth in the terms of the Company ESPP (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) and in a Company ESPP Subscription Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding such assumption or replacement. 

  

 (ii) If Parent elects to cause the Company ESPP to be terminated prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to: (A) cause any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP to be terminated as of the last business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective; (B) make any pro- 

   ##### 

  

    

rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened Company ESPP
Offering Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Company ESPP Offering
Period as a fully effective and completed Company ESPP Offering Period for
all purposes under the Company ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of the last
business day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective) of each
outstanding Company ESPP Option; and (D) provide that no further Company ESPP
Offering Period or Company ESPP Purchase Period shall commence after the
Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses
"(A)" through "(D)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger. On such new Company ESPP Purchase Date, the
Company shall apply each participants Company ESPP Contributions as of such
date to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the Company ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger), the
Company shall terminate the Company ESPP. 

  

 5.4 Employee Benefits. 

   

 (a) As of the Closing Date and for a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall be permitted to do any of the following: (x) cause the Company Employee Plans to remain in effect; (y) subject to any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements, permit employees of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Parent, any Acquired Corporation or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees"), and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including any generally available vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs, but excluding the stock compensation plans or arrangements) of Parent on terms not materially less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent; or (z) cause any one or more Company Employee Plans to remain in effect as contemplated by clause "(x)" of this sentence and permit Continuing Employees to participate in any one or more benefit plans, programs or policies of Parent as contemplated by clause "(y)" of this sentence. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with the terms of the Companys Executive Incentive Plan approved by the board of directors of the Company on June 5, 2008, and for purposes of determining the amount that may be earned by a participant in such plan and may become payable by the Surviving Corporation to such participant under such plan, the Company shall be deemed to have achieved at least 100% of the Companys performance goals under such plan and such participant shall be deemed to have achieved 100% of such participants individual performance goals under such plan. If Parent elects to have Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents participate in any employee benefit plan, program or policy of Parent following the Closing Date, then, subject to any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: 

   

 (i) each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and vacation, sick and personal time off (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under such plan, program or policy for years of service with an Acquired Corporation, provided that such credit (A) does not result in a duplication of benefits, compensation, incentive or otherwise and (B) does not result in an increase in the level of benefits beyond which a similarly situated employee of Parent would be entitled; and 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) if such plan, program or policy is a group health plan of Parent in which Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents will participate, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under such plan to be waived and will use its reasonable best efforts to provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by the Continuing Employees prior to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under such plan that may apply after the Closing Date. 

 

If Parent, in its sole discretion, elects to terminate a flexible spending
account for medical or dependent care expenses under a Company Employee Plan
pursuant to Sections 125 and 129 of the Code (the "Company FSA") during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, then, for each Continuing Employee
who is a participant, and maintains a positive account balance, in the Company
FSA (a "Participating FSA Employee"), on the first day such Participating FSA
Employee is eligible to participate in the flexible spending account for
medical or dependent care expenses under an employee benefit plan of Parent
pursuant to Sections 125 and 129 of the Code (the "Parent FSA"), Parent will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent FSA to assume such
Participating FSA Employees account balance under the Company FSA and the
elections made thereunder attributable to such Participating FSA Employee. 

   

 (b) Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except for Indemnified Persons to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.5, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall limit the effect of Section 9.8. 

  

 (c) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, (i) any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"), and (ii) the Companys bonus vacation program as described in the Companys Employee Handbook 2008 (the "Bonus Vacation Program"). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent). The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request. If the Company is required to terminate the Bonus Vacation Program, the Company shall, effective upon termination thereof, award each employee of the Company who is eligible to earn a bonus vacation under the Bonus Vacation Program the prorated number of bonus vacation days or partial days that, when compared with the full award of 10 days, corresponds to the proportion that the number of days of service performed by such employee bears toward the four-year period required to earn a final vacation bonus award. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure that such notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate shall communicate with Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters, including post-Closing employee benefits and compensation, without the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

   

 (a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Acquired Corporations (each, an "Indemnified Person") as provided in their respective Charter Documents or in any Indemnification Agreement (as defined below) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, but only to the extent such rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses are available under and consistent with Delaware law. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys Charter Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Indemnification Agreements, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of the Acquired Corporations; _provided, however_ , that all rights to indemnification in favor of such current or former directors or officers in respect of any Action (as defined in Section 5.5(b)) pending or asserted or any claim made against them within such six-year period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.5. For purposes of this Agreement, "Indemnification Agreement" shall mean any indemnification agreement between an Acquired Corporation and an Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as a director or officer of an Acquired Corporation, as such agreement is in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "Action") arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission by such Indemnified Person occurring or alleged to have occurred before the Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Person serving as an officer or director of any Acquired Corporation; _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to indemnify and 

   ##### 

  

    

hold harmless, or advance expenses to, an Indemnified Person if and to the
same extent such Indemnified Person is entitled to be indemnified by an
Acquired Corporation or has the right to advancement of expenses from an
Acquired Corporation pursuant to (i) the Charter Documents of such Acquired
Corporation as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) any
Indemnification Agreement between such Acquired Corporation and such
Indemnified Person. In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any
such Action. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits and coverage levels as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Acquired Corporations (the "Existing DandO Policies") with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation (to the extent covered by the Existing DandO Policies) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Tail Policy");  _provided, however_ , that if such "tail" policy is not available at a cost of less than 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company in 2007 for the Existing DandO Policies (the "Maximum Premium Amount"), the Company shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. Parent shall cause the Tail Policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. In the event that any of the carriers issuing or reinsuring the Tail Policy shall become insolvent or otherwise financially distressed such that any of them is unable to satisfy its financial obligations under the Tail Policy at any time during the aforementioned six-year period, Parent agrees that it shall, from time to time, cause the Tail Policy to be replaced with another prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits and coverage levels as the Tail Policy, with a term extending for the remainder of such six-year period (the "New Tail Policy"); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the maximum amount that Parent is required to expend to obtain any New Tail Policy under this Section 5.5(c) exceed the amount by which the Maximum Premium Amount exceeds the sum of (i) the premium paid by the Company for the Tail Policy _plus_ (ii) the aggregate premium(s) paid by Parent and the Surviving Corporation to obtain any other New Tail Policy. In such event, references in this Agreement to the Tail Policy shall be deemed to include any New Tail Policy, as applicable. 

  

 (d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.5. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Charter Documents of the Acquired Corporations or the Surviving Corporation, under any other indemnification arrangement, under the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons. 

  

 (f) This Section 5.5 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the 

    ##### 

 

  

continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successor or assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, honors the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 5.5. 

   

 5.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters. 

   

 (a) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file: (i) the notification and report forms required to be filed under the HSR Act; (ii) any notification or other document required to be filed in connection with the Merger under any applicable foreign Legal Requirement relating to antitrust or competition matters; and (iii) any notification or report required by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DOD 5220.22-M) for facility and personnel security clearances, and any related Department of Energy regulations. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to: (A) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation; (B) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust or competition authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or competition matters; and (C) any inquiries or requests received from the Defense Security Service or the Department of Energy in connection with facility and personnel security clearances. At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any other action with respect to any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired Corporations, provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. 

  

 (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5.6(c), 5.12(a) and 8.3(f), Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5.6(c), 5.12(a) and 8.3(f), each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) shall use its reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other party with a copy of each proposed filing with or other submission to any Governmental Body relating to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall give the other party a reasonable time prior to making such filing or other submission in which to review and comment on such proposed filing or other submission. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a 

   ##### 

  

 

copy of each such filing or other submission made, each notice given and each
Consent obtained by any Acquired Corporation during the Pre-Closing Period. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation under this Agreement to take any of the following actions, if Parent determines in good faith that taking such actions would reasonably be expected to materially affect the business or interests of Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Corporations in any adverse way: (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to dispose of or transfer any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to hold separate any assets or operations; (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of any of the Acquired Corporations; or (vi) to contest any Legal Proceeding or any order, writ, injunction or decree relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. 

  

 (a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of: (i) the discovery by the Company of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement if: (A) such representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance; or (B) such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 or Section 7 impossible or unlikely or that has had or would reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any Legal Proceeding or material claim threatened, commenced or asserted against or with respect to any of the Acquired Corporations. No notification given to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.7(a) or any information or knowledge obtained pursuant to Section 4.1 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the Company contained in this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of: (i) the discovery by Parent of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Parent in this Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Parent in this Agreement if: (A) such representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance; or (B) such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 or Section 7 impossible or unlikely. No notification given to the Company pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of Parent contained in this Agreement. 

  

 5.8 Disclosure. Subject to the terms of Section 4.3(f), except in connection with a valid withdrawal or modification to the Company Board Recommendation made in accordance with Section 5.2(c), Parent and the Company: (a) shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, and use their respective reasonable best efforts to agree on, any press release or other public statement with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Voting Agreement; and (b) except for press releases and public statements required by applicable Legal Requirements or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and (to the extent practicable) agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may make public statements in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences so long as such statements are substantially consistent with press releases, public disclosures or public statements previously issued or made by Parent. 

   

 5.9 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub shall not engage in any business that is not related to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 5.10 Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock being issued pursuant to the Merger to be approved for listing (subject to notice of issuance) on the NASDAQ Global Select Market at or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 5.11 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at or prior to the Effective Time the resignation of each officer and director of each of the Acquired Corporations. 

   

 5.12 Financing. 

   

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken all actions necessary to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions 

   ##### 

  

 

described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (A)
on the terms and subject to the conditions reflected in the Debt Commitment
Letter or (B) on other terms that are acceptable to Parent and would not
materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis; (ii) comply on
a timely basis with all covenants, and satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions, required to be complied with or satisfied by Parent in the
Debt Commitment Letter and in such definitive agreements; (iii) cause the
Debt Financing to be consummated at such time or from time to time as is
necessary for Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement; (iv)
pay any and all commitment or other fees in a timely manner that
become payable by Parent or Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment Letter
following the date of this Agreement, to the extent that the failure to pay
such fees would be reasonably expected to adversely impact the availability
of the financing thereunder; (v) obtain rating agency approvals to the extent
required to obtain the Debt Financing; and (vi) seek to enforce its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided, however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (1) Parent shall have
the right to substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion
of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources so
long as such substitute financing is subject to funding conditions that are
not materially less favorable to Parent than the funding conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter and so long as such substitute financing would
not materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis; and (2) Parent
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause any other
Person to, commence, participate in, pursue or defend any Legal Proceeding
against or involving any of the Persons that have committed to provide any
portion of, or otherwise with respect to, the Debt Financing. In the event
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for any reason or the
Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially
adverse to Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same and/or
alternative financing sources alternative financing on terms not materially
less favorable to Parent than the terms of the Debt Financing in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking
into consideration the funds otherwise available to Parent and the Acquired
Corporations), and (ii) the amount of financing that was contemplated by the
Debt Financing Letter on the date of this Agreement. In the event any
alternative or substitute financing is obtained by Parent in accordance with
the terms of this Section 5.12(a) (the "Alternative Financing"), references in
this Agreement to the Debt Financing (including, for avoidance of doubt, the
references in this Section 5.12 and Exhibit A, but excluding references in
Section 3.6) shall be deemed to refer to the Alternative Financing, and if a
new financing commitment letter is entered into in connection with
such Alternative Financing (the "New Commitment Letter"), references in this
Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter (including, for avoidance of doubt,
the references in this Section 5.12, but excluding the references in Section
3.6 and in clause "(ii)" of the preceding sentence) shall be deemed to refer
to the New Commitment Letter. Parent will provide the Company with a copy of
any New Commitment Letter obtained by Parent in connection with an
Alternative Financing as promptly as practicable following the execution
thereof. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Debt Financing, including the status of Parents efforts to comply with its covenants under, and satisfy the conditions contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letter and shall give the Company prompt notice of any event or change that Parent determines will materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two business days, if at any time: (i) the Debt Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason; or (ii) any financing source that is a party to the Debt Commitment Letter notifies Parent in writing that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend the Debt Commitment Letter in any manner (including by way of a side letter or other binding agreement, arrangement or understanding) that would: (A) expand in any material respect, or amend in a manner materially adverse to Parent, the conditions to the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; (B) prevent or materially impair or delay the Closing; (C) subject to Parents right to obtain substitute financing set forth in Section 5.12(a), reduce the aggregate amount of financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to an amount below the amount needed (in combination with all funds held by or otherwise available to Parent and the Acquired Corporations) to consummate the Merger; or (D) to the Knowledge of Parent, materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall ensure that all financial and other projections concerning the Acquired Corporations that are made available to Parent after the date of this Agreement are prepared in good faith and are based upon assumptions that are reasonable at the time made. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Acquired Corporations; and (B) no Acquired Corporation shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter prior to the Effective Time (unless such fee or liability is subject to the immediately succeeding sentence or such fee or liability is conditional on the occurrence of the Effective Time). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, 

   ##### 

  

 

reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of the Companys counsel and the Companys accountants incurred by
the Acquired Corporations in connection with such requested cooperation, and,
except in cases involving fraud or intentional misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of any of the Acquired Corporations or any
Representative of any Acquired Corporation, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Acquired Corporations against any costs, expenses or liabilities
incurred by the Acquired Corporations as a result of any Action against the
Acquired Corporations arising out of any acts performed by the
Acquired Corporations at Parents request under this Section 5.12.

Any such participation by Parent shall be at Parents sole cost and expense. 

   

 5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements and no-action letters issued by the SEC) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, and the acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section

Agreement is terminated as set forth in the first sentence of this Section
8.3(f), the Companys right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 8.3(f) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Acquired Corporations and their respective stockholders and affiliates
against Parent or any of its Related Persons (as defined below) for, and the
Acquired Corporations (on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
stockholders and affiliates) shall be deemed to have waived all other
remedies (including equitable remedies) with respect to, (i) any failure of
the Merger to be consummated, and (ii) any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of
its obligation to consummate the Merger or any other covenant, obligation,
representation, warranty or other provision set forth in this Agreement.

Section 8.3(f), neither Parent nor any of its Related Persons shall have any
further liability or obligation (under this Agreement or otherwise) relating

contemplated by this Agreement, and in no event shall any Acquired
Corporation (and the Company shall ensure that the Acquired Corporations
controlled affiliates do not) seek to recover any money damages or losses, or
seek to pursue any other recovery, judgment, damages or remedy (including any
equitable remedy) of any kind, in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree that the
Reverse Termination Fee and the agreements contained in this Section 8.3(f)
are an integral part of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that the Reverse Termination Fee constitutes liquidated
damages and not a penalty. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, regardless of whether or not this
Agreement is terminated, except for Parents obligation to pay to the
Company the Reverse Termination Fee if and when such Reverse Termination Fee
becomes payable by Parent to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3(f): 

    

 (1) neither Parent nor any of Parents Related Parties shall have any liability for (x) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.6 or Section 3.7 or any inaccuracy in any other representation or warranty relating to the Debt Financing (regardless of whether such representation or warranty refers specifically to the Debt Financing), or (y) any breach of any of the Parent Financing Covenants, unless such inaccuracy or breach constitutes a Willful Breach by Parent; and 

   

 (2) in the event of any Financing Failure, neither Parent nor any of Parents Related Parties shall have any liability of any nature (for any breach of this Agreement or otherwise) to any Acquired Corporation or to any stockholder or affiliate of any Acquired Corporation. 

 

Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall any
Acquired Corporation (and the Company shall ensure that the Acquired
