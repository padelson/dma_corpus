AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated December 19, 2006, between Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ),

Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of, or authorized committee thereof, each of

the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has
agreed to commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company, including the
associated Company Rights (such shares of Common Stock with the associated
Company Rights are referred to collectively as the " _Shares_ "), at a price
per Share of US$25.00 (such amount or any different amount per Share that may
be paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer
Price_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by law, net to the
seller in cash;

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with
and into the Company with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Merger_ ," and together with the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the " _Transactions_ "), in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share not owned directly or
indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company will be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has unanimously, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, (i) determined that the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are in the best interests of its stockholders, (ii) approved and

including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) determined to recommend that the
Companys stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser
and, to the extent applicable, adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of, or authorized committee thereof, Parent
and Purchaser have, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, unanimously declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger;

WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to Parents and Purchasers
willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution
of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into
tender and stockholder support agreements with Parent and Purchaser (the "
_Support Agreements_ ");



 

1 WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to (i) make certain
representations and warranties in connection with the Offer and the Merger,
(ii) make certain covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and
the Merger, and (iii) prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten
(10) business days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for
cash all Shares at the Offer Price, subject to:

(i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to any
then scheduled Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of Shares which,
together with the Shares then beneficially owned by Parent or Purchaser (if
any), represents at least a majority of:

(x) all Shares then outstanding, _plus_

__(y) all Shares issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any
Company Options, SARs, RSUs, Warrants, Equity Interests or other rights to
acquire Shares then outstanding that are vested and exercisable, convertible
or exchangeable as of any then scheduled Expiration Date or that would be
vested and exercisable, convertible or exchangeable (including after giving
effect to the acceleration of any vesting or exercisability, convertibility
or exchangeability that may occur as a result of the Offer) at any time within
sixty (60) days following the then scheduled Expiration Date assuming that
the holder of such Company Options, SARs, RSUs, Warrants, Equity Interests or
other rights satisfies the vesting or exercisability, convertibility or
exchangeability conditions applicable thereto during such time period, _less_

(z) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of Company Options then
outstanding held by Kevin A. DeNuccio which are vested and exercisable as
of the then scheduled Expiration Date or that would be vested and exercisable
(including after giving effect to the acceleration of any vesting or
exercisability that may occur as a result of the Offer) at any time within
sixty (60) days following the then scheduled Expiration Date assuming that
Mr. DeNuccio satisfies the vesting or exercisability conditions applicable
thereto during such time period (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and



 

2 (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other
conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I.

(b) The obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for any
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or
waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set
forth in Annex I. Subject to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition
and the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the other conditions
and requirements set forth in Annex I, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after Purchaser is legally
permitted to do so under applicable law. The Offer Price payable in respect of
each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
paid net to the Seller in cash subject to withholding as provide in Section
2.2(e).

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I.
Parent and Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
as previously approved by the Company in writing, Purchaser shall not (i)
decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer,
(iv) impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to
the conditions set forth in Annex I, (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition,
(vi) amend any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I, or (vii)
extend the expiration of the Offer in a manner other than as required by this
Agreement.

(d) Unless extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the
Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred
to as the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) The Offer shall be extended from time to time as follows:

(i) _Offer Conditions Not Satisfied_. If on or prior to any then scheduled
Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum
Condition and all other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I)
shall not have been satisfied,  



 

3  or waived by Parent or Purchaser if permitted hereunder, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive periods
of ten (10) business days each in order to permit the satisfaction of such
conditions, or any lesser period ending on April 19, 2007 (the " _Initial
Outside Date_ "), or on December 19, 2007 in the event that the HSR
Condition and/or the Governmental Approval Condition shall not have been
satisfied, or waived by Parent and Purchaser if permitted hereunder, by the
Initial Outside Date (the " _Extended Outside Date_ "), if any such ten-day
extension would otherwise end after the Initial Outside Date or the Extended
Outside Date, as applicable.

(ii) _Required by Applicable Law or Nasdaq_. Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable law, rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC (or its staff) or Nasdaq.

(f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares (without regard to the exercise
of the 90% Top-Up Option) to reach the Short Form Threshold, Purchaser
may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. In the event that more
than eighty percent (80%) of the then outstanding Shares have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer following the Expiration
Date, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) provide for a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act of at least ten (10) business days immediately following the Expiration
Date unless Parent and Purchaser exercise the 90% Top-Up Option. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares
that are validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer during such
"subsequent offering period" promptly after any such Shares are tendered
during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents will provide
for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Section 1.1(f).

(g) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty
four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer.

(h) As soon as practicable after the commencement of the Offer (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Purchaser shall file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), pursuant to
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ "), a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The
Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with
any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and
Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to
be filed with  



 

4  the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable),
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and
Purchaser shall give due consideration to all the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In
addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with
copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments,
that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review any such written responses and Parent and Purchaser shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase
of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository, acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to
the registered holders thereof.

(i) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

(a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ " that shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.3(c), contain the Company Recommendation. The Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable law. The Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable),
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by  



 

5  the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and
any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of
the record holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information and assistance
(including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated
promptly from time to time upon Purchasers request, and their addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its agent may
reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record
and beneficial holders of the Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall promptly deliver to the Company all copies of such
information.

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

(a) Promptly after Purchaser accepts for payment and pays for any
Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment
Time_ "), and at all times thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to elect or
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors
elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by
the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by
Parent, Purchaser and any of its affiliates bears to the total number of
Shares then outstanding. The Company shall, upon Purchasers request at any
time following the purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer,
take such actions, including but not limited to promptly filling vacancies or
newly created directorships on the Company Board of Directors, promptly
increasing the size of the Company Board of Directors (including by amending
the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to increase the size of the
Company Board of Directors) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such
number of its incumbent directors as are necessary or desirable to
enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated to the Company
Board of Directors, and shall use its best efforts to cause Purchasers
designees to be so elected or designated at such time. The Company shall, upon
Purchasers request following the Appointment Time, also cause  



 

6  Persons elected or designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage
(rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of Directors
of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors, (ii) each board of
directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each
committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Global
Market (the " _Nasdaq_ "). Promptly after the Appointment Time, the Company
shall take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled
company" as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary
filings and disclosures associated with such status. The Companys obligations
under this Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to
enable Purchasers designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board
of Directors. Purchaser shall supply the Company with information with
respect to Purchasers designees and Parents and Purchasers respective
officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and
shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of applicable law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to
maintain three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board of Directors
on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as
defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to
serve on the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq rules
and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as
defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the "
_Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing
Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the
Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the
Company Board of Directors) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be
entitled to elect or designate another Person (or Persons) to fill such
vacancy, and such Person (or Persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director then
remains, the other directors shall designate three (3) Persons to fill such
vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Company Board
of Directors after the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, then
the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in
addition to the approval rights of the Company Board of Directors or the
stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (as amended, the " _Company
Certificate_ "), the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (as amended,
the " _Company Bylaws_ ", and together with the Company Certificate, the "
_Company Governing Documents_ ") or applicable law) be required (i) for the
Company  



 

7  to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to exercise or waive any of the
Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action
would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Purchaser), (iii) to amend the Company Governing Documents if such
action would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than
Parent or Purchaser) or (iv) to take any other action of the Company Board of
Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would
materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or
Purchaser); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if there shall be no Continuing
Directors as a result of such Persons deaths, disabilities or refusal to
serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of the entire
Company Board of Directors.

respective subsidiaries and affiliates shall hold, in the aggregate, at least
ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock

DGCL (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), following the Appointment Time and the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Purchaser pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, and the exercise of
the 90% Top-Up Option, if applicable, Parent shall cause the Merger to become

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
securities of the Company or common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are owned by the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of
their respective subsidiaries or affiliates shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share (other
than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2, without interest thereon.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.



 

11 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company to act
as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its
sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders
of the Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Shares. 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest
thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



 

12 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying
Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the relevant Merger Consideration or Offer Price otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
Appraisal Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail
to perfect or  



 

13  otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the
Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands received
by the Company for dissenters rights of any Shares, and Purchaser shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.4 _Top-Up Options_. 

(a) _90% Top-Up Option_.

(i) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _90%
Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, to purchase with a promissory note, bearing
simple interest at 6% per annum, and due 30 days after the purchase (a "
_Promissory Note_ "), at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, that
number of shares of Common Stock (the " _90% Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal
to the lesser of (x) the lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when
added to the number of shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and
their respective subsidiaries and affiliates at the time of such exercise,
shall constitute ten thousand (10,000) shares more than 90% of the shares of
Common Stock then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the 90%
Top-Up Option Shares) and (y) an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
that is equal to 19.9% of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as
of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the 90% Top-Up Option shall
not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance
of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be
reached (assuming the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares); and
_provided_ __, _further_ , that in no event shall the 90% Top-Up Option be
exercisable for a number of shares of Common stock in excess of the Companys
total authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock.

(ii) Provided that no applicable law, rule, regulation, order, injunction or
other legal impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the 90% Top-Up Option or
the issuance of the 90% Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise
make such exercise or issuance illegal, Purchaser may exercise the 90% Top-Up
Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the Appointment Time
and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.



 

14 (iii) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the 90% Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _90% Top-Up
Exercise Notice_ ," the date of which notice is referred to herein as the "
_90% Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or
certificates evidencing the 90% Top-Up Option Shares which the Purchaser
wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of the
purchase and sale pursuant to the 90% Top-Up Option (the " _90% Top-Up
Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the 90% Top-Up
Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the
number of 90% Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefore
(the " _90% Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the 90% Top-Up Closing, Purchaser
shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the 90% Top-
Up Option Shares, by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the amount specified in the 90% Top-Up Notice Receipt, and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate or
certificates representing the 90% Top-Up Option Shares. Such certificates may
include any legends that are required by federal or state securities laws. 

(b) 50% Top-Up Option.

(i) In order to offset the dilutive impact of the issuance of Shares pursuant
to the exercise, conversion or exchange of any Company Options, SARs, RSUs,
Warrants, Equity Interests or other rights to acquire Shares following the
Appointment Time, the Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the " _50% Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, to purchase with a Promissory Note, at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price, that number of shares of Common
Stock (the " _50% Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of (x) the
lowest number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective
subsidiaries and affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute ten
thousand (10,000) shares more than 50% of the shares of Common Stock then
outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the 50% Top-Up Option
Shares) and (y) an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to
19.9% of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the date
hereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the 50% Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of shares
of Common Stock pursuant thereto, Purchaser would own more than 50% of the
Shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the 50% Top-Up Option
Shares); and _provided __,_ _further_ , that in no event shall the 50% Top-Up
Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Common stock in excess of the
Companys total authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock.

(ii) Provided that no applicable law, rule, regulation, order, injunction or
other legal impediment shall prohibit the exercise of the 50% Top-Up Option
or the issuance of the 50% Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or otherwise
make such exercise or issuance illegal, Purchaser may exercise the 50% Top-Up
Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the Appointment Time
and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the record date for the Special
Meeting, and (ii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.



 

15 (iii) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the 50% Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a "5 _0% Top-Up
Exercise Notice_ ," the date of which notice is referred to herein as the "5
_0% Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or
certificates evidencing the 50% Top-Up Option Shares which the Purchaser
wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of the
purchase and sale pursuant to the 50% Top-Up Option (the "5 _0% Top-Up
Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the 50% Top-Up
Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the
number of 50% Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefore
(the "5 _0% Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the 50% Top-Up Closing, Purchaser
shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the 50% Top-
Up Option Shares by delivery of a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate purchase price specified in the 50% Top-Up
Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a
certificate or certificates representing the 50% Top-Up Option Shares. Such
certificates may include any legends that are required by federal or state
securities laws.

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and other Equity Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option, or portion thereof, to purchase Shares
granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (" _Company Options_ ") or stock
appreciation right, or portion thereof, whether settled in cash or Shares ("
_SAR_ "), in each case granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, that is
outstanding and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
deemed exercised and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of Shares for which such Company Option or SAR was vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration less the per Share exercise price of such
Company Option or SAR (the " _Option Consideration_ ") after which it
shall be cancelled and extinguished.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option and SAR that was outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by the
Parent and converted into the right to receive the Option Consideration,
provided that the Company Option or SAR shall be subject to the same vesting
arrangements that were applicable to such Company Option or SAR immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Parents obligation to pay the Option
Consideration will only become payable to the extent that such vesting
requirements are satisfied. For each Share subject to a Company Option or
SAR which would have vested after the Effective Time under the vesting
schedule applicable to such Company Option or SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to a cash payment equal
to the Option Consideration, and Parent shall pay the holder thereof the
Option Consideration as soon as administratively practicable after the day on
which such Share would have vested.



 

16 (c) At the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable with respect to
each unvested Share subject to restrictions and forfeiture granted pursuant
to the Company Stock Plans (" _Restricted Stock_ ") shall be subject to the
same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such
unvested Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Therefore,
cash otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for the Restricted
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Unvested Cash_ ") shall not automatically be payable by Parent at the
Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on the date that
such Shares of Restricted Stock would have become vested under the vesting
schedule in place for such shares immediately prior to or at the Effective
Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule).
Parent shall make all such required payments to holders of Unvested Cash as
soon as administratively practicable after the day on which such
Unvested Cash would have become vested under the original vesting schedule.
All outstanding rights to repurchase Restricted Stock that the Company may
hold or similar restrictions in the Companys favor immediately prior to the
Effective Time (all such rights, the " _Repurchase Rights_ ") shall be
assigned to Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent
upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Repurchase Rights may be
exercised by Parent retaining the Unvested Cash into which such Restricted
Stock has been converted, and paying to the former holder thereof the
repurchase price in effect for each such Share subject to that Repurchase
Right immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, each Share subject to a Restricted Stock
Unit granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans (" _RSU_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by the
Parent and converted into the potential right to receive a cash payment equal
to the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ "); provided, however,
that the RSU shall be subject to the same vesting arrangements that were
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time and payment of the RSU
Consideration with respect to a Share subject to an RSU will only become
payable by the Parent to the extent that such vesting requirements are
satisfied. For each Share subject to an RSU which would have vested after the
Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to a cash payment equal
to the RSU Consideration, and Parent shall pay the holder thereof the RSU
Consideration as soon as administratively practicable after the day on which
such Share subject to the RSU would have vested.

(e) The Company shall take all necessary actions, including obtaining any
required consents from holders of outstanding Company Options, SARs,
Restricted Stock and RSUs necessary to effect the transactions described in
Sections 2.5(a)-(d) above pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the Company Options, SARs Restricted
Stock and RSUs. All amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.5(a)-(d) shall be
paid without interest, and no Unvested Cash or RSU Consideration or rights to
receive any payments pursuant to Section 2.5(c) and (d) may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by
any legal or  



 

17  equitable process in satisfaction of any liability of such Person, prior to
the distribution to such Person of such Unvested Cash or RSU Consideration
or payment pursuant to Section 2.5(c) and (d), in accordance with this
Agreement. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be net of all
applicable withholding taxes that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Option Consideration, Unvested Cash, RSU
Consideration, or Merger Consideration under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state,
local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Section 2.6 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Each outstanding
purchase right (each, a " _Purchase Right_ ") under the Companys 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") shall be cancelled immediately
prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive at the
Effective Time from Parent, an amount (subject to any withholding tax required
by applicable law) in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the number of Shares issuable to the holder of such Purchase Right had such
Purchase Right been exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the purchase price
under such Purchase Right. Within five (5) days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Company to return to participants their respective
accumulated payroll contributions not applied to the purchase of Shares under
the ESPP, if any. 

Section 2.7 _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to
purchase Shares (the " _Warrants_ ") that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and not terminated pursuant to its
terms shall be assumed by Parent and converted into the right to receive cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
Shares for which such Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration less
the per Share exercise price of such Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_
"). The Company shall take all necessary actions, including obtaining any
required consents from holders of outstanding Warrants necessary to effect
such assumption pursuant to the terms of the applicable Warrant. Any
payments made pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be net of all applicable
withholding taxes that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and withhold
from the Warrant Consideration under the Code, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Warrants
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or distributed.

(g) Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses each Benefit
Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan which is (i) unfunded or self-
insured or (ii) funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as such term is
defined in Code Section 419(e)  



 

27  or other funding mechanism. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each such employee welfare benefit plan may be amended or
terminated (including with respect to benefits provided to retirees and other
former employees) without liability (other than benefits then payable under
such plan without regard to such amendment or termination) to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary at any time. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries complies in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute
with respect to each Benefit Plan that is a group health plan within the
meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such state statute. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any material obligations for retiree
health or life insurance benefits under any Benefit Plan (other than for
continuation coverage under Section 4980B(f) of the Code).

(h) Except as may be required by applicable law, or as contemplated under this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any plan or
commitment to create any additional Benefit Plans or Foreign Plans, or to
amend or modify any existing Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan in such a manner as
to materially increase the cost of such Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(i) Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses: (i) each
material payment (including any bonus, severance, unemployment compensation,
deferred compensation, forgiveness of indebtedness or golden parachute
payment) becoming due to any current or former employee under any Benefit Plan
or Foreign Plan because of this Agreement (or the consummation of the
Transactions); (ii) any increase in any material respect of any benefit
otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan; (iii) any
acceleration in any material respect of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits under any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan; or (iv) any material
obligation to fund any trust or other arrangement with respect to compensation
or benefits under a Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan in each case caused or
triggered by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger or the other Transactions contemplated hereby. No
payment or benefit which has been, will or may be made by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary with respect to any current or former employee located in
the United States in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby would
fail to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. Neither this Agreement
(or the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby) nor any other
agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and an employee or other service provider that, considered
individually or considered collectively with any other such agreements,
plans, arrangements or other contracts, could reasonably be expected to, give
rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that would be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.



 

28 (j) Correct and complete copies have been delivered or made available to
Parent by the Company of all material Benefit Plans and Foreign Plans
(including all amendments and attachments thereto); written summaries of any
material Benefit Plan not in writing, all related trust documents; all
insurance contracts or other funding arrangements to the degree applicable;
the most recent annual information filings (Form 5500) and annual financial
reports for those Benefit Plans (where required); the most recent
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (where required); all
material written agreements and contracts relating to each Benefit Plan and
Foreign Plan, including administrative service agreements and group insurance
contracts; and the most recent summary plan descriptions for the Benefit Plans
(where required) and in respect of Benefit Plans and Foreign Plans, the most
recent actuarial valuation and any subsequent valuation or funding advice
(where required, including draft valuations).

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has entered into any contract,
agreement, arrangement or understanding with any officer or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with or in contemplation
of the Transactions, except as contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(l) To the knowledge of the Company, no payment pursuant to any Benefit Plans
or other arrangement between the Company or a Company Subsidiary and any
"service provider" (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and
the United States Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance thereunder),
including, without limitation, the grant, vesting or exercise of any stock
option or the grant or vesting of an RSU, would subject any Person to a tax
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, whether pursuant to the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger, any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise.

(m) All Company Options have been appropriately authorized by the Companys
Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, including approval of
the option exercise price or the methodology for determining the option
exercise price and the substantive option terms. All Company Options granted
to employees in the United States that are potentially subject to Code Section
409A have a per share exercise price which reflects the fair market value of
the Companys common stock as determined in good faith compliance with Section
409A of the Code on the date that the option was granted (within the meaning
of United States Treasury Regulation §1.421-1(c)). To the knowledge of the
Company, no Company Options have been retroactively granted, or the exercise
price of any Company Option determined retroactively. The Company Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has determined that each of the
members of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") are, and the Company represents and warrants that
each of the members of the Compensation Committee are and at the Expiration
Date will be, "independent directors" as defined in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the
Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Compensation Committee
under the Exchange Act and all applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. On or
prior to the date hereof, the Compensation Committee, at a meeting duly called
and held, approved each Company Compensation Arrangement as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (an " _Employment
Compensation Arrangement_ "), and has taken all other action necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor with respect to
such Company Compensation Arrangements in accordance to Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act.



 

29 Section 3.12 _Taxes_.

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Entity all material Tax Returns required to be filed
by them. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material
respects. All material Taxes due and owing by any of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary on or before the date hereof (whether or not shown on any
Tax Returns) have been paid, or both are being contested in good faith and
have been reserved for in accordance with GAAP on the Financial Statements.
None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary currently is the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. No claim
has ever been made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where any of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or may
be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary did not, as of
the dates of the Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability
set forth on the face of the balance sheets contained in such Financial
Statements. Since the date of the most recent Financial Statements, neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries have incurred any liability
for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent
with past practice.

(c) No deficiencies for material Taxes with respect to any of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have been claimed or proposed in writing or assessed
by any Tax authority. There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge,
threatened audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any
material liability in respect of Taxes of any of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, and there are no matters under discussion with any Tax
authority, or known to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, with
respect to Taxes that are likely to result in an additional material liability
for Taxes with respect to any of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies
of federal, state and local income Tax Returns and other material Tax Returns
of each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their predecessors
for the years ended December 31, 2003 through 2005, and complete and accurate
copies of all examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
any predecessors since January 1, 2003, with respect to Taxes of any type.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any predecessor
has waived any statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed
to any extension of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or
deficiency, nor has any request been made in writing for any such extension or
waiver.

(d) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (other than with respect to Liens for Taxes (i) not yet
due and payable or (ii) being contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP on the Financial
Statements).



 

30 (e) None of the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been a United
States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

(f) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has withheld and paid all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or
other third party.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any liability
for the Taxes of any other Person (other than the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.15026 (or any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee, by
contract, or otherwise. None of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated
federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which is
the Company).

(h) There are no Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements (including
indemnity arrangements) with respect to or involving any of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (except for the allocation of Taxes set forth in
leases, contracts and commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business), and, after the Closing Date, none of the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries shall be bound by any such Tax sharing agreements
or similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has constituted a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock to which
Section 355 of the Code (or so much of Section 356 of the Code as relates to
Section 355 of the Code) applies. 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (i) has agreed, or
is required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code for any
period after the Closing Date by reason of a change in accounting method or
otherwise; or (ii) is a shareholder of a "passive foreign investment company"
within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code.

(k) None of the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into
any transaction identified as a "reportable transaction" for purposes of
Section 6111 of the Code or Treasury Regulation § 1.6011-4(b)(1), or analogous
provisions of any state or local Tax law.



 

31 Section 3.13 _Contracts_.

(a) Except as filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof, there is no Company Agreement (a) any of the benefits to any
party of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits to any party
of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the Transactions or
(b) which, as of the date hereof, (i) is a "material contract" (as such term
is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii) involves
aggregate expenditures in excess of $20 million, (iii) involves annual
expenditures in excess of $5 million and was not entered into in the
ordinary course of business, (iv) that contains "take or pay" provisions
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (v) that contains any
non-compete or exclusivity provisions with respect to any line of business or
geographic area with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
upon consummation of the Transactions, Parent or its Subsidiaries, or which
restricts the conduct of any line of business by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or upon consummation of the Transactions, Parent or its
Subsidiaries, or any geographic area in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or upon consummation of the Transactions, Parent or its
Subsidiaries conducts business, or (v) which would prohibit or materially
delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions. Each contract of the type described above in Section 3.13,
whether or not set forth in Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
is referred to herein as a " _Company Material Contract_." Each Company
Scheduled Agreement is valid and binding on the Company and each Company
Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Companys knowledge, each other party
thereto, as applicable, and in full force and effect (except that (x) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally and (y) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought),
and the Company and each Company Subsidiary has performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under each Company
Scheduled Agreement and, to the Companys knowledge, each other party to each
Company Scheduled Agreement has performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under such Company Scheduled
Agreement, except as would not be reasonably expected to, (1) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, or (2) result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or default under (or any
condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause
such a violation of or default under) any Company Scheduled Agreement except
for violations or defaults that would not be reasonably expected to, (1)
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or (2)
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent or provided to
Parent for review, prior to the execution of this Agreement, true and complete
copies of all of the Company Material Contracts or other Company Scheduled
Agreements required to be disclosed in Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, which are not filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents and the
Company Material Contracts required to be disclosed in Section 3.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents
are true and complete copies of such contracts.



 

32 Section 3.14 _Title to Properties; Encumbrances_. The Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries has good, valid and marketable title to, or, in the case
of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its
tangible properties and assets except where the failure to have such good,
valid and marketable title has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;
in each case subject to no Liens, except for (a) Liens reflected in a
consolidated balance sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date, (b) Liens consisting
of zoning or planning restrictions, easements, permits and other restrictions
or limitations on the use of real property or irregularities in title thereto,
which do not materially impair the value of such properties or the use of
such property by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
operation of its respective business, (c) Liens for current Taxes, assessments
or governmental charges or levies on property not yet due and payable and
Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which an adequate reserve has been provided on the
appropriate financial statements and (d) Liens which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect (the foregoing Liens (a)-(d), " _Permitted Liens_ "). The
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms
of all material leases of tangible properties to which they are a party,
except for non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such
material leases are in full force and effect, and the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such
material leases.

Section 3.15 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list, as of the date hereof, of the following Owned Company IP: (i)
all Registered IP; and (ii) all unregistered Trademarks used in connection
with Company Products; in each case listing, as applicable, (A) the name of
the applicant or registrant and current owner, (B) the jurisdiction where the
application or registration is located, (C) the Governmental Entity with which
the application or registration is filed, (D) the application or registration
number, and (E) all proceedings or actions before any court or tribunal
(including the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any equivalent
authority anywhere else in the world) related to Company Registered IP. The
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has in a timely manner made all
filings, payments, and recordations and taken all other actions required to
obtain and maintain ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights in each item
of Company Registered IP.

(b) Section 3.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all Company Agreements that are material to the Company, in
effect as of the date hereof, in each case specifying the date of and parties
to the agreement and whether such agreement is exclusive or non-exclusive, (i)
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries uses or has the right
to use any Licensed Company IP, other than non-exclusive licenses and related
services agreements for generally commercially  



 

33  available software that is not incorporated into any Company Products or
(ii) under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has licensed
or otherwise permitted others the right to use any Company IP or Company
Products (such agreements described in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the "
_Company IP Agreements_ "). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has granted any exclusive license under any Owned Company IP. To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no pending disputes regarding the scope of
any Company IP Agreements, performance under any Company IP Agreements, or
with respect to payments made or received under any Company IP Agreements,
except where such disputes have not had and would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the
Company (A) no parties to the Company IP Agreements are in material breach
thereof, and (B) all Company IP Agreements are binding and are in full force
and effect except for those Company IP Agreements that by their terms have
expired or been terminated since the date hereof. 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries own or
otherwise have all Intellectual Property Rights needed to conduct the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted prior to the Closing
Date.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries exclusively own all right, title and
interest in the Owned Company IP, free and clear of all Liens, other than
Liens which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and which for the purposes of
this Section do not include licenses under Intellectual Property Rights.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Person who is or was an employee or
contractor of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and who is or was involved in
the creation or development of any Owned Company IP has executed a valid
agreement containing an assignment of all Intellectual Property Rights in such
employees or contractors contribution to the Owned Company IP.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member
of, or a contributor to, any domestic or foreign industry standards body
or similar organization which membership or contribution may require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant or offer to any other third party
any license or right to any Company IP. No Governmental Entity has any
ownership interest in any Owned Company IP, and neither Company nor its
Subsidiaries use or have used any funding, facilities, or personnel of any
Governmental Entity in connection with the creation of the Owned Company IP in
a manner that could give rise to an ownership interest in the Owned Company
IP in favor of such Governmental Entity.

(f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable and
appropriate steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of the Trade
Secrets of Company and its Subsidiaries, and to the knowledge of the Company,
there are no unauthorized uses, disclosures or infringements of any such Trade
Secrets by any Person that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Companys knowledge, all use and disclosure by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of Trade Secrets owned by another Person has been pursuant to
the terms of a  



 

34  written agreement with such Person permitting such use or was otherwise
lawful, except to the extent that any such use or disclosure that was not done
in accordance with such a written agreement does not and will not,
individually or in the aggregate, give rise to a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have executed confidentiality
agreements with all employees and contractors to whom the Company or its
Subsidiaries have granted access to Trade Secrets, which agreements prohibit
such employees and contractors from disclosing such Trade Secrets to third
parties or using such Trade Secrets for any purpose other than for the
benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their current products or services or other
operation of the Companys or its Subsidiaries business has infringed upon or
otherwise violated, or is infringing upon or otherwise violating, in any
respect the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. To the knowledge
of the Company as of the date hereof, no Person or any of such Persons
products or services or other operation of such Persons business is
infringing upon or otherwise violating any Owned Company IP in any material
respect.

(h) No action, claim or proceeding alleging infringement, misappropriation,
or other violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another Person is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, has been threatened against
Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any notice or other communication relating to any actual,
alleged, or suspected infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any
Intellectual Property Right of another Person by Company or any Subsidiary.
The Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order of any
Governmental Entity that restricts or impairs the use of any Company IP.

(i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions will not (with or without notice or the lapse of time, or both)
automatically result in (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries granting to any
third party any rights or licenses to any Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) any right, including any right of
termination, amendment, modification, cancellation or acceleration under any
Company IP Agreement, (iii) the loss of or the imposition of any Lien on any
Owned Company IP, (iv) the release, disclosure, or delivery of any Owned
Company IP by or to any escrow agent or other Person; or (v) after the Merger,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being required, under the terms of any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, to
grant any Person any rights or licenses to any of Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights.

(j) No software incorporated in any Company Product is subject to any
"copyleft" or other obligation or condition (including any obligation
or condition under any "open source" license such as the GNU Public License,
Lesser GNU Public License, or Mozilla Public License) that (i) could require,
or could condition the use or distribution of any software contained in
any Company Product on, the disclosure, licensing, or distribution of any
source code for any portion of Owned Company IP in a Company Product, or (ii)
could otherwise impose any limitation, restriction, or condition on the right
or ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to use or distribute any
software contained in any Company Product.



 

35 (k) None of the source code used by Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
material to the conduct of the business of the Company, including software
contained any of the Company Products, (collectively, " _Company Source Code_
") has been disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to its
employees or advisers or pursuant to non-disclosure agreements, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, by any other person except as authorized by the
Company under a non-disclosure agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has provided or licensed, or has any duty or obligation (whether
present, contingent, or otherwise) to provide or license, Company Source Code
to any escrow agent or other third party. No event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse
of time) will, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the provision,
license, or disclosure of any Company Source Code to any third party.

(l) The Companys and its Subsidiaries collection and dissemination of
personal information in connection with their business has been conducted in
accordance with applicable privacy policies published or otherwise adopted by
the Company and its Subsidiary and any applicable laws and regulations,
except where the failure to abide by any such policy or law would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to give rise to a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 3.16 _Labor Matters_.

(a) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) there is
no collective bargaining or other labor union or foreign work council contract
applicable to Persons employed by the Company or any of the

Company Collective Bargaining Agreement is being negotiated by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, (iii) as of the date of this Agreement,

of the Company, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has committed
any material unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the
respective businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with applicable laws, rules and regulations with respect to employment,
employment practices, and terms, conditions and classification of employment
(including applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding wage and hour
requirements, immigration status, discrimination in employment, employee
health and safety, and the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act), except for such noncompliance as has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(a) As of the date hereof, the Company and each Company Subsidiary have
complied and are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations,

Company Material Adverse Effect, and no notice, charge or assertion has been
received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary alleging

All licenses, authorizations, consents, permits and approvals required under
such laws, rules and regulations are in full force and effect except where the
failure to be in full force and effect have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals and clearances of
any Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and each Company Subsidiary
to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on their respective
businesses substantially in the manner described in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof and substantially as it is being conducted as
of the date hereof (the " _Company Permits_ "), and all such Company Permits
are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and
effect of, any of the Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor to the
knowledge of the Company, any of their respective directors, officers, agents,
employees or representatives (in each case acting in their capacities as such)
has (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or

such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law or contract entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.3 _Consents and Approvals_.

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions
as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any

of the Transactions, (iii) make or cause to be made the applications or
filings required to be made by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of

their respective affiliates to, furnish to the other party all information
necessary for any such application or other filing to be made in connection
with the Transactions. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform
the other of any material communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such application or filing. If a party hereto intends to
independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such party

Representatives of the other party to participate in the meeting with the
Governmental Entity unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity. The
parties shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions

party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the Transactions, (ii) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from
occurring prior to or after the consummation of the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in
determining whether any actions, notices, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be given or obtained, or should be given or obtained, from parties
to any Company Scheduled Agreements in connection with consummation of the
Transactions and seeking any such actions, notices, consents, approvals or
waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party
consent described in the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b), such party
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to mitigate any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to

required to, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will without

agree to any limitation on the conduct of its business, in order to obtain any
such consent.

by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging or seeking
material damages in connection with the Transactions or (ii) seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise limit
in any material respect the right of Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser

Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement
of any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents views with
respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such
stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide
any notice or information to Parent the provision of which the Company in good
faith determines may adversely affect the Companys or any other persons
attorney client or other privilege with respect to such information.

(d) If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity challenging the
Transactions as violative of any applicable law, each of the Company and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist, except insofar as
the Company and Purchaser may otherwise agree, any such action or proceeding,
including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation
of the Transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent or Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the
consummation of the Offer. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
control and supervision over its business operations.

permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of
Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or the conduct of their
business in a specified manner.

beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of
the stockholders of Purchaser, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with applicable law.



 

54 Section 6.4 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective controlled affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent
of the other party, unless such party determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is required by applicable law or by any listing
agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or
trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in
which event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect
to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any such review or comment to the other party in connection with any
disclosure contemplated by Section 5.2 or Section 5.3.

Section 6.5 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permissible under
applicable provisions of the DGCL (i) under the Company Certificate and
Company Bylaws (and the equivalent organizational documents of all such
Company Subsidiaries) in effect on the date hereof (true and correct copies
of which previously have been made available to Parent) and (ii) under any
indemnification or other similar agreements (the " _Indemnification
Agreements_ ") in effect on the date hereof between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the current and former directors, officers and other
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the " _Covered Persons_ ")
arising out of or relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as
directors, officers or employees occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim or claims
are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.5(a) pursuant to the procedures set
forth, and to the extent provided in the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws or the Indemnification Agreements as in effect on the date hereof;
provided, however, that any Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes,
to the extent required by the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or the
DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification.



 

55 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior to and including
the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate
and Company Bylaws. The Indemnification Agreements with Covered Persons in
existence on the date of this Agreement that survive the Merger shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain and extend all existing officers
and directors liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims
arising in whole or in part from facts or events that actually or allegedly
occurred on or before the Effective Date, including in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage
and amounts containing terms no less favorable to the Covered Persons than
the existing DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the existing DandO
Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period through no
fault of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for
insurance under this Section 6.5(d) in excess of 200% of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company in 2006 for such purpose (the " _Base Premium_
"), the true and correct amount of which is set forth in Section 6.5(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if Parent or
the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required
by this Section 6.5(d) for such aggregate premium, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for aggregate
premiums not in excess of 200% of the Base Premium. In lieu of the foregoing,
the Company may obtain prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time, which
policies may provide the Covered Persons with DandO Insurance coverage of
equivalent amount and on no more favorable terms than that provided by the
Companys current DandO Insurance for an aggregate period of at least six (6)
years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be relieved of all further obligations under this
Section 6.5(d); _provided_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder.

(e) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set
forth in this Section 6.5.



 

56 (f) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.5, and this Section 6.5 shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (including their
successors and heirs) or terminated without the consent of the Covered Persons
(including their successors and heirs) affected thereby.

Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair
price" or other anti-takeover laws or regulations enacted under state or
federal laws becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Company, the
Offer, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger, the
Support Agreements or any other Transaction, then the Company Board of
Directors shall take all action necessary to render such statute inapplicable
to the foregoing.

Section 6.7 _Certain Tax Matters_. During the period from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, the Company shall and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to: (i) timely file all material Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Company or such Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, and
prepare such Tax Returns in all material respects in a manner consistent with
past practice, (ii) timely pay all material Taxes due and payable by the
Company and such Company Subsidiary, respectively, except for such Taxes
contested in good faith and for which an adequate reserve has been established
in accordance with GAAP on the appropriate financial statements and (iii)
promptly notify Parent of any federal or state income or franchise, or other
material Tax, suit claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit pending
against or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in respect of
any Tax matters (or any significant developments with respect to ongoing Tax
matters), including without limitation material Tax liabilities and material
refund claims.

Section 6.8 _Rights Agreement; Consequences if Rights Triggered_. The Company
Board of Directors shall take all action requested in writing by Parent or
Purchaser in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Offer, the
Merger, the Support Agreements and the other Transactions. Except as approved
in writing by Parent, the Company Board shall not (i) amend the Company Rights
Agreement, (ii) redeem the Company Rights or (iii) take any action with
respect to, or make any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement, in
each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser. If any Distribution
Date, Stock Acquisition Date or Flip-In Event occurs under the Company Rights
Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the
Offer Price as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve
the economic benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected
on the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.9  _Section 16_. The Company Board of Directors shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective
Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the
deemed disposition and cancellation of the vested Company Options in the
Merger. Provided that Company shall first provide to Parent the names of its
stockholders and the number of shares of Common Stock or Company Options which
may be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and any other  



 

57  information reasonably requested by Parent and relating to the same, the
Board of Directors of Parent, or an authorized committee thereof, shall, prior
to the Effective Time, take appropriate action to approve, for purposes of

holders of Company Options in accordance with Section 2.5.

Section 6.10 _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 6.11 _Employee Benefits Matters_. Except as provided in the last

have no obligation to continue after the Effective Time any plan or
arrangement in effect immediately before the Effective Time (except as
otherwise required by applicable law, including without limitation ERISA and
the Code) for current or former employees, officers or directors of the
Company or any Subsidiary, and shall have the discretion to continue or
terminate any of such programs, or to merge any of them into plans or
arrangements in effect for other employees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. To the extent legally permitted, employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting under any employee pension benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries and for the purpose of eligibility and determining the amount
of any benefit with respect to any employee welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation for
service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company
or any Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit. Parent shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to perform the
Companys obligations under the change in control and other agreements set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule between the Company and certain of
its officers and employees unless any such officer or employee agrees
otherwise.

Benefit Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of section 401(k) of
the Code (each such Benefit Plan, a "401(k) Plan"). At the Closing, the
Company shall provide Parent with (i) executed resolutions of the Company
Board of Directors authorizing such termination and (ii) an executed copy of
any necessary amendment to each such 401(k) Plan in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that is intended to assure compliance with all
applicable requirements of the Code and the regulations thereunder.



 

58 Section 6.13 _Rule 14d-10(d)_. Prior to the Expiration Date, the Company
(acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all such steps as may

officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to
such officer, director or employee to be approved as an Employment
Compensation Arrangement and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive

Section 9.7 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates"
shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. All
references to this Agreement shall be deemed to include references to the
"plan of merger" contained herein (as such term is used in the DGCL). The
table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision
hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference shall be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Unless otherwise
indicated, all references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The parties hereto
agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in
an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting
such agreement or document.



 

73 Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties.

Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement:

(a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements
(except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be amended so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1 hereof, Parent
and Purchaser shall be permitted to take the action contemplated by this
Agreement, including the making of any proposals as contemplated by Section
5.3) and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of
them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and

(b) except as provided in Section 6.5, are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer or the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.11  _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. (a) This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the law of any other state.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to  



 

74  commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such Delaware Court of Chancery court or, if no such state
court has proper jurisdiction, the in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware Court of Chancery or Federal court, and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware
Court of Chancery or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.4. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law. Each party hereto agrees
not to commence any legal proceedings relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions in any jurisdiction or courts other than as
provided herein.

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY IS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
OFFER AND MERGER CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B)
IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.12.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Purchaser may assign, in its
sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and
one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent or (iii) to
one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent (each, an "
_Assignee_ "). Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any
party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates shall have the right to
collaterally assign in whole or in part this Agreement and any ancillary
agreements or documents related to the Transactions and any of
their respective rights thereunder as security to one or more lenders or
purchasers of debt securities who, in each case, are being granted a
collateral interest in this Agreement or any ancillary agreements or documents
related to the Transactions. 



 

75 Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

pursuant to the Offer or seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) seeking to impose material
limitations on the ability of Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf), or
render Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf) unable, to accept for
payment, pay for or purchase any or all of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or
the Merger, or seeking to require divestiture thereof or any material assets
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii) seeking to prohibit or impose
any material limitations on the ownership or operation by Parent (or any of
its Subsidiaries) of all or any portion of businesses or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries as a result of or in

any Governmental Entity, other than  



 

I-i  the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable waiting periods
under HSR Act or similar waiting periods with respect to the Required

consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

(c)(i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5(b) shall not be true and correct in
all material respects, each as of the date hereof and as of the expiration
date of the Offer with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such

and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, other than

shall not be true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any
references to any Company Material Adverse Effect or materiality
qualifications and other qualifications based upon the concept of materiality
or similar phrases contained therein and without giving effect to
any modifications or updates to the Company Disclosure Schedule) as of the
date of the Merger Agreement and as of the expiration date of the Offer with

contained therein and without giving effect to any modifications or updates to
the Company Disclosure Schedule) as of such date or time);

(d) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), change(s), event(s),
development(s) or circumstance(s) have occurred, arisen or come into existence
or become known to the Company, Parent or Purchaser, which is continuing and
which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such fact(s), change(s), event(s), development(s) or
circumstance(s), a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(e) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to
perform or to comply with any agreement or covenant to be performed
or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement prior to the expiration of
the Offer (or, in the case of Section 6.1 hereof, shall have intentionally
breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply with such
Section 6.1) and such breach or failure shall not have been cured;

(f) Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company,
executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company, dated as of the scheduled Expiration Date, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this Annex I have not
occurred; or



 

I-ii (g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may
be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such condition, and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion
of Parent or Purchaser, subject in each case to the terms of the Merger
Agreement. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a
limitation of the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate and/or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Any reference in this Annex I or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirements is so waived. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and, each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

As used in this Annex I, the term " _Required Governmental Approvals_ " shall
mean any applicable review process by CFIUS under the Exon-Florio Act
(including, if applicable, any investigation commenced thereunder) and any
other material approval or consent of any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction reasonably deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by Parent
by the later of (i) ten business days after the date of the Merger Agreement,
and (ii) five business days after Parent has received all information from
the Company which is reasonably necessary to enable Parent to determine which
such approvals or consents may be necessary, appropriate or desirable under
applicable law, as shall be evidenced by a list of which will be delivered to
the Company within such period. The other capitalized terms used in this Annex
I shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is annexed,
except that the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the
Agreement to which this Annex I is annexed.

II-i _Schedule 5.4_

Promptly after the date of the Agreement, the Company will issue to and set
aside with a disbursement agent (the "Disbursement Agent") the maximum number
of Shares that the Company would be required to issue pursuant to the
Reorganization Plan and the Bankruptcy Confirmation Order to the holders of
such Unresolved Bankruptcy Claims/Interests were such Unresolved Bankruptcy
Claims/Interests allowed in the respective maximum amounts claimed by
such holders (the "Escrowed Shares"). To the extent any Unresolved Bankruptcy
Claims/Interests are allowed in a liquidated amount prior to the Effective
Time, the Disbursement Agent shall promptly distribute the applicable portion
of the Escrowed Shares to the holders of such allowed Unresolved Bankruptcy
Claims/Interests, and if all Unresolved Bankruptcy Claims/Interests have been
resolved as of the Effective Time, then all Escrowed Shares not required to be
distributed to any holders of Unresolved Bankruptcy Claims/Interests shall be
delivered by the Disbursement Agent to the Company and cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) of the Agreement. If, as of the Effective Time, any Escrowed
Shares remain undistributed, and one or more Unresolved Bankruptcy
Claims/Interests remain unresolved, then (i) that portion of the remaining
Escrowed Shares that would be required to be issued pursuant to the
Reorganization Plan and Bankruptcy Confirmation Order to the holders of such
Unresolved Bankruptcy Claims/Interests were such Unresolved Bankruptcy
Claims/Interests allowed in the respective maximum amounts claimed by such
holders shall be converted to the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Agreement, and the applicable portion of
such Merger Consideration shall be distributed to such holders as and when
their Unresolved Bankruptcy Claims/Interests are allowed in a liquidated
amount, and (ii) the remaining portion of such Escrowed Shares shall be
delivered by the Disbursement Agent to the Company and cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) of the Agreement. Upon resolution and payment from the Merger
Consideration of all Unresolved Bankruptcy Claims/Interests that were
unresolved as of the Effective Time, any remaining Merger Consideration shall
be delivered by the Disbursement Agent to the Company and shall become
unrestricted cash of the Company.
