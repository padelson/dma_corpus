actions as Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, may reasonably require of the
other party to more effectively assign, convey and transfer the Assets and
the Shares to Buyer and cause Buyer to assume the Assumed Liabilities, and
otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that
the assignment of any Assumed Contract to Buyer hereunder shall require the
consent of the other party thereto that has not been obtained on or prior to
Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same
if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof. Seller will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and Buyer will cooperate with
such efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable the consent of the other
parties to such Assumed Contracts for the assignment thereof to Buyer,
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be obligated to
make any payment or take any other action detrimental to Seller or Buyer,
respectively, or their respective Affiliates to obtain any such consent. If
any such consent is not obtained, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer in any arrangement reasonably requested
by Buyer to provide for Buyer the benefits under any such Assumed Contract
for the duration of its remaining term (without exercise of any extension
thereof), including the enforcement at the cost of and for the benefit of
Buyer of any and all rights thereunder of Seller or their respective
Affiliates against the other party thereto. To the extent Buyer is provided
the benefits of any such Assumed Contract, Buyer shall perform for the
benefit of the other Persons that are parties thereto the obligations of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller thereunder and any related liabilities
(other than Excluded Liabilities). Nothing in this _Section_  3.4(b) is
intended to limit Buyers rights under _Section_ 8.1(c) or 8.3.

  



  

3.5. _Closing Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the Closing Date, Seller will cause to be prepared and delivered
to Buyer a draft combined adjusted statement, together with notes thereto, of
the Net Assets (which shall include any cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of Suplementos Solgar, unless any such asset shall have been
transferred pursuant to clause (i) of _Section_ 6.2) as of the Effective Time
on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Statement_ ") including a schedule based
on such Closing Statement setting forth Sellers calculation of the Net
Assets as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing_

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

 _Net Asset Value_ ").  The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_
") (as in effect on March 31, 2005), except as set forth in the notes to the
Financial Statements or on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ hereto and as such methodology
was used by Seller to prepare the statement of Net Assets as of March 31,
2005 included in the Financial Statements, and shall include line items and
notes substantially consistent with such statement of Net Assets; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) the Inventory identified on _Schedule 3.5(a)_ (to the
extent still held in inventory at the Closing, the " _Specified Inventory_ ")
shall be valued at zero cost for purposes of calculating Closing Net Asset
Value and the calculation of Closing Net Asset Value shall include no reserve
or accrual with respect to such Specified Inventory and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than pursuant to _Section_
4.13(b), Seller makes no representation or warranty whatsoever with respect
to such Specified Inventory and (ii) Closing Net Asset Value shall not
include any reserve or accrual with respect to any Excluded Liability or any
liability or obligation for which Seller has agreed to provide
indemnification to Buyer under this Agreement. Buyer shall cause Suplementos
Solgar and Buyers Affiliates and their respective employees to assist Seller
(without reimbursement or compensation from Seller for such assistance) in
the preparation of the Closing Statement and shall provide Seller and its
independent auditors access, upon reasonable advance notice and at all
reasonable times, to the personnel, properties and Books and Records relating
to the Business for such purpose, all in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the business of Buyer and its Affiliates.
Buyer and Seller agree not to attempt to influence Employees as to the
information provided with respect to the preparation of the Closing
Statement.

  



  

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of Closing Net Asset Value
contained in the Closing Statement, Buyer may, within sixty (60) days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Seller disagreeing
with such calculation and setting forth Buyers alternative calculation of
such amount (" _Notice of Disagreement_ "). Such Notice of Disagreement, if
any, shall specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees, and
Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement. If Buyer does not duly deliver a Notice
of Disagreement within said sixty (60) days, then the Closing Statement shall
be final and binding on the parties.

  



  

(c) If a Notice of Disagreement shall be duly and timely delivered pursuant
to _Section_ 3.5(b), the parties shall, during the thirty (30) days following
such delivery, use their diligent efforts in good faith to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amount of Closing Net Asset Value. If, during such period, the parties
are unable to reach agreement on some or all of the disputed items or
amounts, they shall promptly thereafter cause a mutually acceptable firm of
nationally recognized independent public accountants (the " _Accountant_ ")
promptly to review this Agreement, the appropriate Books and Records and the
items or amounts remaining in dispute for the purpose of calculating the
Closing Net Asset Value. In making such determination, the Accountant shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement or Sellers
calculation of Closing Net Asset Value as to which Buyer disagreed in the
Notice of Disagreement and that have not been resolved by the parties during
the above referenced thirty (30) day period. The Accountant shall deliver
to Seller and Buyer, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth
such determination; provided that the Closing Net Asset Value set forth in
such determination shall not in any event be more than the Closing Net Asset
Value calculated by Seller set forth in the

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

Closing Statement or less than the Closing Net Asset Value calculated by
Buyer set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. Such report shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto. The cost of such review and
report shall be borne by the parties in direct proportion to the difference
between the amount of Closing Net Asset Value asserted by such party and the
Final Net Asset Value. " _Final Net Asset Value_ " shall mean (A) Closing Net
Asset Value as shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section_
 3.5(a) if no Notice of Disagreement with respect thereto is duly and
timely delivered, (B) the Closing Net Asset Value agreed upon by the parties
pursuant to this _Section_ 3.5(c) or (C) in the absence of such agreement,
the Closing Net Asset Value as shown in the Accountants report delivered
pursuant to this _Section_ 3.5(c).

  



  

3.6. _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) If the amount of Sixty-Four Million Two Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand
Dollars ($64,227,000) (the " _Base Net Asset Value_ ") exceeds the Final Net
Asset Value, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section_ 3.6(b), the
amount of such excess over the Final Net Asset Value. If the Final Net Asset
Value exceeds Base Net Asset Value, Buyer shall pay to Seller, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided
in _Section_  3.6(b), the amount of such excess over the Base Net Asset
Value. Any such payment pursuant to this _Section_  3.6(a) shall be due and
payable within ten (10) business days following determination of the Final
Net Asset Value in accordance with _Section_  3.5.

  



  

(b) Any payment made pursuant to this _Section_  3.6 shall be made by wire
transfer or by delivery to the payee of the required amount in immediately
available funds.  The payee shall designate its preferred method of payment
(and wire instructions, if appropriate) for such purpose at least two (2)
days prior to the date of the required payment. If the payee fails to so
designate its preferred method of payment, payment shall be made by certified
or official bank check payable in immediately available funds to the order of
the payee. The amount to be paid under this _Section_ 3.6 shall bear interest
from and including the Closing Date to and including the date one (1) day
prior to payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate publicly announced by
JP Morgan Chase Bank in New York, New York as its thirty (30) day LIBOR rate
in effect on the Closing Date plus 25 basis points. Interest shall
be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five (365)
days and the actual number of days for which interest is due.

  



  

3.7. _Retention of Certain Rights by Seller and Asset Transferor Entities and
Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or suggested
in this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, Seller and the Asset
Transferor Entities and their Affiliates shall and do hereby retain ownership
of and all rights in and to all Intellectual Property (other than the
Transferred Intellectual Property) without restriction or limitation, except
subject to Buyers rights under the License Agreement. Sellers and its
Affiliates retained rights shall include, without limitation, the right to
manufacture, distribute, promote, advertise, use, offer for sale and sell
products utilizing the Know-How (other than that included in the Transferred
Intellectual Property), and the right to use, sell, offer for sale, license,
transfer and otherwise dispose of such Know-How (other than that included in
the Transferred Intellectual Property), except in each case as restricted or
limited by the provisions in the License Agreement or this Agreement.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
afford the officers, employees, representatives, lenders and agents of Buyer
reasonable access to the facilities and employees of the Business and the
records of Seller and its Affiliates relating to the Business (but not
including confidential personnel records) during normal business hours and in
a manner that will not unreasonably disrupt the operation of the Business.

dated September 30, 2004 between Buyer and Seller, which agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. In
addition, access may be limited, if necessary, by Applicable Law, contractual
obligations entered into prior to the date hereof, or preservation of
privilege.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable and in any event no later than thirty (30)
days after the end of each fiscal quarter of the Business ending after the
date hereof and before the Closing Date (other than the fourth quarter) or

together with notes, if any, relating thereto.

  



  

(c) Until the Closing, the parties hereto will comply with the

and each party hereto will hold, and will cause its Affiliates, and use its

Affiliate or representative), unless (i) compelled to disclose by judicial,
administrative or other legal process or by other requirements of Applicable
Law or (ii) disclosed in a legal proceeding brought by a party hereto to
enforce its rights or in the exercise of its remedies hereunder, for a period
of five

(5) years following the Closing, all documents and information concerning the
other party or any of its Affiliates furnished to it by the other party or
such other partys representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby except to the extent that such documents or
information can be shown to have been (a) previously known by the party
receiving such documents or information, (b) in the public domain (either
prior to or after the furnishing of such documents or information hereunder)
through no fault of such receiving party or (c) later acquired by the
receiving party from another source if the receiving party is not aware that
such source is under an obligation to the disclosing party hereto to keep
such documents and information confidential; _provided_  that the
restrictions in this sentence will not apply to Buyers use of the documents
and information concerning the Assets, the assets and properties
of Suplementos Solgar and the Business transferred to Buyer by

transactions contemplated hereby and destroy or cause to be destroyed all
notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings
related thereto or based thereon prepared by the party furnished
such documents and information or its representatives.

  



  

7.4. _Filings and Authorizations_.  Seller and Buyer have filed or supplied
or will, as promptly as practicable, file or supply, or cause to be filed or
supplied, all notifications and information required to be filed or supplied
pursuant to any Competition Laws, including, without limitation, the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
"), in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Operative Agreements. As promptly as practicable, (a) Seller and Buyer
will make, or cause to be made, and shall cooperate with the other in making
or causing to be made all such other filings and submissions under laws,
rules and regulations applicable to them, or to any Affiliate, as may be
reasonably required for them to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Operative
Agreements, and (b) Buyer and Seller will use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all authorizations, approvals, consents
and waivers from all Governmental Authorities necessary to be obtained by

Act in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.5. _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

  



  

(i) Except for Buyers portion of Taxes described in _Section_ 7.5(a)(v) or
for Taxes included in the Final Net Asset Value, Seller shall be liable for,
and shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless against, all (A) Taxes relating
to the Assets for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date, and (B) Taxes imposed on Suplementos Solgar directly or as a
member of the Spanish Tax Group, as regulated under Chapter VII Title VII of
Spanish RDL 4/2004 of 5 March 2004, for any taxable year or period that ends
on or before the Closing Date and, in each case (A) and (B), with respect to
any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date (including, without limitation, any

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to Suplementos Solgar
and any of Sellers Tax Affiliates).

  



  

(ii) Except for Sellers portion of Taxes described in _Section_ 7.5(a)(v),
Buyer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
against, all (A) Taxes relating to the Assets for any taxable year or period
that begins after the Closing Date, and (B) Taxes imposed on Suplementos
Solgar for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date and,
in each case (A) and (B), with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date (including,
without limitation, any obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax
determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to
Suplementos Solgar and any of Buyers Tax Affiliates).

  



  

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date
shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable years or periods, one which ended on the Closing Date and the other
which began on the day after the Closing Date, and items for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
applicable party were closed at the close of business on the Closing Date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and measured by the amount, value or level of any item other
than income, such items shall be allocated on a pro rata per diem basis and
(B) extraordinary items described in Treas. Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C)
shall be allocated to the day that they are taken into account.

  



  

(iv) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii), where, under applicable
law, a taxable year or period ends as a result of the purchase of the Shares
pursuant to this Agreement, items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit
shall be allocated between such taxable year or period and the following
taxable year or period in a manner consistent with the rules in Treas. Reg.
§1.1502-76(b).

  



  

(v) Seller and Buyer shall each be liable for, and shall indemnify the other
against, 50% of all sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or
other similar Tax imposed on the transactions contemplated by Article 2 of
this Agreement; provided, however, that any and all value-added and similar
Taxes shall be the responsibility of, and shall be paid by, Buyer. Buyer and
Seller shall fully cooperate in timely completing and filing with the
appropriate taxing authority all forms necessary to qualify for any and all
exemptions to sales Taxes and value added Taxes. It is the intention of
Seller and Buyer that the transactions contemplated by _Article_  2 of this
Agreement constitute the sale of a business and that the transactions qualify
for all applicable exemptions from value-added Taxes and state and local
sales and use Taxes, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any inconsistent
position in any Tax Return.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, following the date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall each, as
promptly as practicable, take all reasonable efforts to notify and request
confirmation in writing from H.M. Revenue and Customs that value added Taxes
are not chargeable on the sale of the business in the United Kingdom under
the provisions of Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995,
No 1268, Art 5).

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

(vi) Unless reflected in Final Net Asset Value, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amounts of any refund, abatement or credit of Taxes received by Buyer from a
Governmental Authority related to the Business which are attributable to (A)
any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date, (B) in the case
of any Straddle Period the amount of the refund, abatement or credit of Taxes
received by Buyer from a Governmental Authority attributable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date consistent with the
principles of _Section_ 7.5(a)(iii), or (C) Taxes for which Seller has
previously indemnified Buyer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
be obligated to pay Seller the amount of any refund, abatement or credit of
Taxes that is reflected in the Final Net Asset Value. Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amounts of any refund, abatement or credit of Taxes received by
Seller from a Governmental Authority related to the Business which are
attributable to (A) any taxable period that begins after the Closing
Date, (B) in the case of any Straddle Period the amount of the refund,
abatement or credit of Taxes received by Seller from a Governmental Authority
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after
the Closing Date consistent with the principles of _Section_ 7.5(a)(iii), or
(C) Taxes for which Buyer has previously indemnified Seller.

  



  

(b) For all taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when due
all Tax Returns with respect to Suplementos Solgar and shall timely remit (or
cause to be remitted) to the appropriate Governmental Authority any Taxes due
in respect of such Tax Returns; provided, however, that with respect to such
Tax Returns that are due after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
present, or cause to be prepared and presented, such Tax Returns (or in the
case of a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return, a pro forma Tax
Return reflecting the Taxes with respect to the Business) to Buyer for review
and comment on the Closing Date or at least five (5) days before the date on
which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (or, in the case of Tax
Returns related to income Taxes, at least twenty-five (25) days before the
date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed), whichever is later,
and shall consider in good faith any suggestion or comments made by Buyer
with respect to such Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to disclose any Tax
Returns or other information other than those which are related solely to the
Business.  For all Straddle Periods and taxable years or periods beginning
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, when due all Tax Returns with respect to Suplementos Solgar and
shall timely remit (or cause to be remitted) to the appropriate
Governmental Authority any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Seller
shall pay to Buyer in sufficient time for Buyer to pay the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the portion of the Tax liability attributable to
Seller on such Straddle Period Tax Returns as determined pursuant to
_Section_ 7.5(a).  Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return filed by Seller or
make any Tax election that would affect the Tax liability of (i) Suplementos
Solgar, with respect to any Straddle Period or any taxable years or periods
ending on or before the Closing Date, or (ii) Seller or any of Sellers Tax
Affiliates, in each case (i) and (ii), without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonable withheld; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Buyer shall be entitled to make an election under Section 338 of
the Code (or any similar provision under the laws of Spain) or an election to
treat Suplementos Solgar as a pass-through entity for U.S. or Spanish Tax
purposes without Sellers consent. Buyer will file all Tax Returns with
respect to Straddle Periods in accordance with Sellers past practice (except
as required by law).  Buyer shall prepare and present such Straddle Period
Tax Returns to Seller for review and comment at least five (5) days

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

before the date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (or, in
the case of Tax Returns related to income Taxes, at least twenty-five (25)
days before the date on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed) and
shall consider in good faith any suggestions or comments made by Seller with
respect to such Tax Returns. Any disputes regarding the application of this
_Section_ 7.5(b) with respect to a Tax Return relating to taxable years or
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or a Straddle Period Tax Return
that remains unresolved following such period shall be resolved pursuant to
_Section_ 7.5(g).

  



  

(c) _Contest Provisions_.  Buyer shall notify Seller and Seller shall notify
Buyer, as the case may be, in writing upon receipt of written notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
assessments or proceedings (" _Tax Proceedings_ ") which may affect the Tax
liability of (i) Buyer or Suplementos Solgar, for which Seller would be
required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section_ 7.5,
(ii) Seller, or (iii) any Tax Affiliate of Seller. Seller shall have the
right to represent, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in at
Buyers own expense the representation of, Suplementos Solgars interest
in any such Tax Proceeding and any Tax Proceeding relating to any taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense. Seller has the right, but not the obligation, to
jointly represent its interests with Buyer in any Tax Proceeding relating to
Taxes for any Straddle Period. Any disputes regarding the conduct
or resolution of any Tax Proceeding shall be resolved pursuant to _Section_
 7.5(g).

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_.

  



  

(i) Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate and share all required information on
a timely basis in order to timely file all Tax Returns (including any Tax
Returns to be filed as a consequence of the sale of the Shares and
Suplementos Solgars exit from the Spanish Tax Group) related to the Business
and for the preparation of any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of
any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment related to
the Business. Buyer and Seller agree to retain or cause to be retained all
books and records pertinent to the Business until the applicable period for
assessment under applicable law (giving effect to any and all extensions or
waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. After
the Closing, each party will give the other reasonable notice prior to
discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to Tax matters
pertinent to the Business and, if such other party so requests and at its
expense, the requesting party will be allowed to take possession of such
books and records. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving Suplementos Solgar for
any Tax purpose and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney
and other documents as are necessary and appropriate to carry out the intent
of this subsection.

  



  

(ii) An allocation of the Purchase Price by jurisdiction based upon the fair
market value of each of the Assets and the Shares to be sold by Seller and
acquired by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement is attached as _Schedule
7.5(d)_.  Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other to determine,
prior to the Closing Date, the applicable values, allocations and other
information necessary to file Forms 8594 with respect to the transactions
contemplated by Article 2 and shall each file all Tax Returns consistent
therewith. Seller and Buyer will mutually agree in writing upon appropriate
adjustments to such allocation as

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

necessary following the Closing to account for adjustments to the Purchase
Price made pursuant to this Agreement. All adjustments to the Purchase Price
made pursuant to this Section 7.5(d)(ii) and Section 7.5(e) will be made
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder,
or in accordance with applicable foreign law.

  



  

(e) _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payment by Buyer or Seller under this
_Section_ 7.5 hereof will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

(f) _Survival of Obligations_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including _Section_  12.3 hereof), the obligations of the
parties set forth in this _Section_  7.5 shall be unconditional and absolute
and shall remain in effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

  



  

(g) _Disputes_. In the event that Seller or Buyer dispute the application or
interpretation of any provision of _Sections_  4.6 or 7.5(a), or the amount
or calculation of Taxes, if any, owed by such party thereunder, such party
shall deliver to the other a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail,
the nature of and/or the dollar or euro amount, as applicable, of any
disagreement so asserted. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
such dispute within twenty (20) business days following the commencement of
such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within such
twenty (20) business day period, the dispute shall be resolved by the
Accountant.  The Accountant shall determine, only with respect to the
specific disagreements submitted in writing by Seller and Buyer, the manner
in which such item or items in dispute should be resolved; provided, however,
that the dollar or euro amount of any such item or items shall be determined
within the range of dollar or euro amounts proposed by Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The Accountant shall be directed to make
such determination promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after acceptance of its appointment. Any finding by the Accountant shall be
a reasoned award stating the findings of fact and conclusions of law (if any)
on which it is based, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding the disputed
items so presented. The fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne
exclusively by the party whose estimate of the Tax owed is furthest from the
amount owed as determined by the Accountant. The parties shall otherwise bear
their own expenses incurred in any dispute resolution pursuant to this
_Section_ 7.5(g).

  



  

(h) _Sole Remedy_. This _Section_ 7.5 shall be the sole provision governing
Tax matters and the parties indemnification obligations for Taxes except
that such indemnification obligations shall be subject to the provisions set
forth in _Section_ 11.6. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) _Section_  11.3
shall not apply to the parties indemnification obligations for Taxes
set forth in this _Section_ 7.5 and (ii) to the extent a party is entitled
to payment from the other party under this _Section 7.5_ , such payment
shall be for the full amount thereof and shall not be subject to any
baskets, thresholds, caps or other similar limitations.

  



  

7.6. _Use of Certain Names_. As promptly as practicable, but in any event
within three hundred sixty (360) days after the Closing, Buyer shall and
shall cause Suplementos Solgar to revise product literature and labeling
(including by way of stickering), change packaging and stationery, and
otherwise discontinue use of the names "Wyeth," "Wyeth-Ayerst," "Wy,"
"American Home Products," "AHP," "AHPC," "American Cyanamid," "Cyanamid,"

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

"Cy," "Lederle," "Led," "A. H. Robins," "Robins" and "Whitehall" and any
variation, derivative or name imitative thereof (collectively, " _Names_ ");
provided, however, that, with respect to finished goods inventory included in
the Inventory and product inventory manufactured by Suplementos Solgar or its
Affiliates prior to the Closing, Buyer and Suplementos Solgar may continue to
sell such inventory, notwithstanding that it bears one or more of the Names,
for a reasonable period of time after the Closing (not to exceed three
hundred sixty (360) days). In no event shall Buyer or Suplementos Solgar use
any Names after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different
from the use of such Names by Suplementos Solgar during the ninety (90) day
period preceding the date hereof. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, discontinue use of the name Solgar and any variation,
derivative or name imitative thereof following the Closing.

  



  

7.7. _Removal of Assets_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, but in no event later than two hundred seventy (270) days, Buyer
shall arrange to have the Assets set forth on _Schedule 1.10_ removed from
the premises of the Asset Transferor Entities or any other Affiliate of
Seller at which such Assets are located as set forth in such Schedule, and
transferred to premises of Buyer at Buyers sole cost. As soon as
reasonably practicable after Buyers written request, but in no event later
than one hundred twenty (120) days following such request, Seller shall
arrange to have all tangible Excluded Assets removed from Suplementos
Solgars premises and any premises comprising the Assets, and transferred to
premises of Seller at Sellers sole cost.

  



  

7.8. _Access to Records After Closing_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives shall have reasonable access
to all of the books and records of the Business with respect to periods prior
to the Closing Date to the extent that such access may reasonably be required
by Seller in connection with matters relating to or affected by the
operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date (including integrated
records of other businesses of Seller or its Affiliates). Seller or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be solely responsible for any costs and
expenses incurred by Seller or such Affiliate pursuant to this _Section_
7.8(a). Buyer shall afford such access upon receipt of reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours. If Buyer or its Affiliates shall
desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of
such six (6) year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give Seller
a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense, to segregate and remove such
books and records as Seller may elect.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives shall have reasonable access
to all of the books and records relating to the Business which Seller or any
of its Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Such access shall be
afforded by Seller and its Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours. Buyer or its Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred
by it pursuant to this _Section_ 7.8(b). If Seller or any of its Affiliates
shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six (6) year period, Seller shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may elect.

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

7.9. _Disclosure Supplement_.  Prior to Closing, Seller, as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware thereof, shall deliver to Buyer supplements
to the Disclosure Schedule, if appropriate, to reflect (a) any fact or
condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Sellers
representations and warranties made as of the date of this Agreement or (b)
the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that
would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or
constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had that
representation or warranty been made as of the time of the occurrence of, or
Sellers discovery of, such fact or condition. Prior to Closing, Buyer, as
promptly as practicable upon becoming aware thereof, shall deliver to Seller
supplements to the Disclosure Schedule, if appropriate, to reflect (a) any
fact or condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of Buyers
representations and warranties made as of the date of this Agreement or (b)
the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that
would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or

any information or documentation to any third party relating to any business
combination transaction solely involving the Assets, the Shares, the assets

Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

7.15. _Covenant Not to Compete_.

period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, (i) employ or seek to
employ any employee of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer who is employed at the
Closing by Buyer or such Affiliate in connection with the Business, unless
such employee resigns without solicitation by Seller or its Affiliates, is
terminated after the Closing Date or is responding to general solicitations
to the public, general advertising or untargeted advertisements for
employment, or (ii) engage in any Competitive Business (as hereinafter
defined) in the United States of America; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent Seller or
its Affiliates from (x) acquiring or merging with any business, Person or

the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such acquisition were
derived from businesses other than a Competitive Business, or (y) being
acquired by, or engaging in a business combination, a merger of equals or a
similar transaction with, any Person or entity engaged in a Competitive
Business; and, in each such case, continuing to operate such Competitive
Business.

  



  

(b) " _Competitive Business_ " shall mean the sale of an over-the-counter,
human ingestible product that contains substantially the same ingredients in
substantially the same levels and substantially the same form as the Vitamin

described in the labels attached hereto as _Exhibit_ G, to the extent sold
directly to independent health food stores or to the stores or distributors
set forth on _Schedule 7.15(b)_  hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
acknowledges that the conduct of the business of Seller and/or its Affiliates
(including research and development and business derived therefrom) as
conducted as of the Closing Date shall not constitute operation of a
Competitive

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

Business, including, without limitation all current and future products sold
by Seller and/or its Affiliates under its trademarks in existence as of the

determines that any term or provision contained in this _Section_  7.15 is
invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or geographic area of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

  



  

7.16. _Adverse Experience Reporting Requirements_. Upon Closing, Buyer shall
be solely responsible for all adverse experience reporting for all products
of the Business if and as required and in compliance with all applicable laws
regarding the monitoring, reviewing and reporting of adverse experiences to
applicable Governmental Authorities. To the extent Seller receives any
information regarding an adverse experience which may be related to the use
of such products of the Business, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with
all such information within five (5) calendar days of Sellers receipt date.
Such information shall be transmitted to Buyer as follows:

incentive bonus, savings and retirement plans, provided such plan is not

(c) To the knowledge of Seller, each International Plan maintained by a Share
Transferor Entity or Suplementos Solgar that is intended to qualify for

9.5. _International Employees of the European Union_.

  



  

(a) Seller and Buyer accept and agree that the transfer of employment of the
Ex-U.S. Employees in the EU countries (hereinafter referred to as " _European
Employees_ ") will be effected and governed by the Transfer Provisions
(defined below).

  



  

(b) Buyer shall ensure that its Affiliates (where necessary) comply with
their respective obligations under the Transfer Provisions and upon
reasonable request provide Seller or the relevant Sellers Affiliate with
such information necessary to enable either Seller or its Affiliate as the
case may be to carry out its duties under the Transfer Provisions concerning
measures to effectuate the transfer of the European Employees to Buyer.

  



  

(c) " _Transfer Provisions_ " shall mean any legislation implementing the
provisions of Directive 77/187/EEC commonly called the Acquired Rights
Directive or Transfer of Undertakings Directive.

  



  

9.6. _Treatment of Seller s International Plans_.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide the Ex-U.S.
Employees who are Transferred Employees with plans, programs and benefits
which are the same as those provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer. If Buyer does not currently have other employees in a particular
country, Buyer shall provide benefit plans, policies or arrangements which
are substantially similar to those provided to Ex-U.S. Employees who are
Transferred Employees by Seller immediately prior to Closing Date.

  



  

(b) No assets or liability of any International Plan shall be transferred to,
or become the responsibility of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including,
without limitation, Suplementos Solgar) or to any plan of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, without limitation, Suplementos Solgar) or be retained
by Suplementos Solgar or any of its plans.

  



  

(c) Buyer shall recognize each Ex-U.S. Employees service with Seller and
Sellers Affiliates for purposes of determining retirement and savings plan
eligibility for participation and vesting of benefits under the appropriate
pension plan of Buyer, but not for purposes of accruing the benefits under
such plans.

  



  

(d) With respect to all Ex-U.S. Employees, Seller shall retain liability
under any group life, accident, workers compensation, medical,
hospitalization, prescription drug, dental or short-term or long-
term disability plan, whether or not insured, for any claims incurred on or
prior to the Closing Date (or, if later, the date an Ex-U.S. Employee becomes
a Transferred Employee) and Buyer shall assume all liability for claims
arising after the Closing Date or, if later, the date an Ex-U.S. Employee
becomes a Transferred Employee) under any group life, accident, workers
compensation, medical, hospitalization, prescription drug, dental or short-
term or long-term disability plan (" _Buyer s International Welfare
Plans_"). For purposes of this _Section_ 9.6(d), claims shall be deemed to
have arisen:

  



  

(i) with respect to all death or dismemberment claims, on the actual date of
death or dismemberment;

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

(ii) with respect to disability or salary continuance claims, on the day the
claimant became disabled or otherwise entitled to salary continuation;

  



  

(iii) with respect to all hospital, medical, drug or dental claims, on the
date the service or supply was purchased or received by the claimant; and

  



  

(iv) with respect to workers compensation claims, on the date of the
occurrence.

  



  

(e) As of the Closing Date, all Ex-U.S. Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the appropriate Buyers International Welfare Plans in
accordance with the terms of such plans, and employment with Seller and its
Affiliates shall be taken into account for purposes of determining
eligibility for participation and benefits under Buyers
International Welfare Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) unless
prohibited by the vendors of Buyers International Welfare Plans, Ex-U.S.
Employees shall participate under Buyers International Welfare Plans as of
the Closing Date without any waiting periods, without any evidence of
insurability, and without application of any pre-existing physical or mental
condition limitations, except to the extent applicable under Sellers
International Plans, and (ii) unless prohibited by the vendors of Buyers
International Welfare Plans, Buyer shall count claims arising on or prior to
the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying deductibles, out-of-pocket
maximums, and other similar limitations in Buyers International Welfare
Plans.

  



  

9.7. _Stock Options_.  Seller shall be responsible for and incur the costs of
stock option compensation for all Employees with stock options from Seller
that are exercisable or become exercisable as of the Closing Date. In
addition, Seller shall be responsible for payments, if any, to Employees
relating to non-exercisable stock options as of the Closing Date. Seller
shall be liable for any payments, withholding obligations and reporting
obligations that arise after the Closing Date under this _Section_ 9.7 under
any applicable stock option or stock incentive plan in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement shall
create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any Employee (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any persons in respect of continued
employment with any of Suplementos Solgar, with Seller, or with any of its
Affiliates and no provision of this Agreement shall create any such rights in
any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any U.S. Employee Plan or U.S. Benefit Arrangement, any
International Plan or any plan or arrangement which may be established by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on the right of Buyer, Suplementos Solgar or any
Affiliates of Buyer to terminate any Employee at will.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 10 
  
 TERMINATION**

  



  

10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

(b) by Buyer or Seller (provided it is not in material breach hereof) if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to August 15, 2005; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate under this _Section_ 10.1(b) shall
not relieve any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before such date of any liability of such party to the other
party hereunder for such failure;

  



  

(c) subject to _Section_ 7.4, by Buyer or Seller if a Governmental Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in
each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

  



  

(d) by Buyer or Seller if a material breach of this Agreement has been
committed by the other, which such breach has not been cured within five (5)
business days after written notice thereof by the terminating party to the
non-terminating party; or

  



  

(e) by Buyer or Seller upon receipt of written notice from the other party
that satisfaction of a condition to such terminating partys obligations
hereunder is impossible.

  



  

10.2. _Effect of Termination_.  Except as set forth in this _Article_ 10 and
_Sections_ 4.17, 5.2, 7.1 and 7.3, and _Article_ 12, upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ 10.1, all further obligations of
the parties under this Agreement shall terminate without further liability of
any party to the others, except for any willful breaches of this Agreement
prior to the time of such termination.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 11 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

11.1. _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Except with respect to any claim related to Taxes, for which _Section_
7.5 of this Agreement shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy, and
subject to _Section_ 11.3, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives and controlling Persons from any liability, damage,
deficiency, loss, judgments, assessments, cost or expense, including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigating and defending against,
or cooperating with respect to, lawsuits, complaints, actions or other
pending or threatened litigation, but specifically excluding consequential,
special and punitive damages and damages for lost profits (except to the
extent any of the foregoing excluded damages are specifically included in an
award to a third party) (" _Losses_ "), incurred by such Persons arising from
or attributable to:

  



  

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement (excluding _Section_ 4.6 in accordance with _Section_ 7.5(h));

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

(ii) any failure of Seller to perform or observe any covenant or agreement to
be performed or observed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) the Excluded Liabilities;

_Schedule 4.9(b)(i)_ ;

  



  

(vi) the claims set forth as items (1) through (5) on _Schedule 4.10(a)_
(and, with respect to such claims, any other claim asserted by the same
claimant based on the same operative facts) and the assessment and appeal
identified in paragraph (vii) under item (2) on _Schedule 4.13(a)_ (the
defense or prosecution of which claims, assessments or appeals, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be retained and controlled by Seller, subject to
paragraph (d) of _Schedule 11.2_ and, with respect to the assessment and
appeal identified in paragraph (vii) under item (2) on _Schedule 4.13(a)_ ,
the second sentence of paragraph (c) of _Schedule 11.2_ ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Seller may, in its sole discretion, determine after the date
hereof not to pursue such appeal and to pay such assessment in full
in accordance with its terms));

  



  

(vii) in each case only to the extent directly related to activities of the
Business prior to the Closing, the matters set forth on _Schedule 4.10(b)_ ;

  



  

(viii) in each case only to the extent directly related to activities of the
Business prior to the Closing, fines and penalties assessed by Governmental
Authorities directly related to the matters set forth as item (4) on
_Schedule 4.13(a)_ and items (3) through (20) on _Schedule 4.13(b_ ); and

  



  

(ix) any non-compliance with any bulk sales laws or fraudulent transfer law
in respect of the contemplated transactions.

  



  

(b) Except with respect to any claim related to Taxes, for which _Section_
7.5 of this Agreement shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling Persons
from Losses incurred by such Persons arising from or attributable to:

  



  

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any failure of Buyer duly to perform or observe any covenant or
agreement to be performed or observed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities;

  



  

(iv) the Buyer Environmental Liabilities; and

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

(v) all liabilities and obligations (except for any Environmental
Liabilities) to the extent relating to the manufacture, use, sale, marketing,
promotion or distribution of products of the Business, or the operation of
the Business or the Assets, from and after the Closing (including without
limitation liabilities and obligations under adverse experience reporting
requirements, if any are imposed or applicable from or after the Closing,
under any Applicable Laws).

  



  

(c) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify each other for all Taxes for the periods
and in the manner described in _Section_  7.5, which shall be the sole and
exclusive basis for indemnity for Taxes under this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in _Sections_ 11.1 or
11.2, Seller shall have the right to direct, manage and control, and take
such actions as are reasonably necessary in connection with, any Remedial
Action or defense or other resolution (collectively, the " _Primary Control
Rights_ ") of any claim, event or condition subject to indemnification under
_Sections_ 11.1(a)(i) (relating to a breach of _Section_ 4.12) and
11.1(a)(iv) (Retained Environmental Liabilities). Seller shall also
have Primary Control Rights concerning any claim, event or condition with
respect to which Seller is responsible for a majority of the Losses under
_Section_  7.12. In the event Seller does not elect to assume Primary
Control Rights or with respect to matters where Seller does not have Primary
Control Rights under this _Section_ 11.1(d), Buyer shall have the right to
assume the Primary Control Rights over the claim, event or condition. Upon
advance written notice by Seller to Buyer, Buyer shall provide Seller with
access to the Leased Real Property reasonably necessary for Seller to
exercise its Primary Control Rights under this _Section_ 11.1(d).  Seller
shall notify and consult with Buyer with respect to such matters prior to
taking action and, to the extent any claim, event or condition subject to
indemnification involves or requires work to be performed at the Leased
Real Property, Seller shall in all material respects:

  



  

(i) comply with all Applicable Laws (including, without limitation,
Environmental Laws) and all leases related to the Leased Real Property;

  



  

(ii) use the Leased Real Property and perform Remedial Action in a manner
that will not unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably interrupt the
operations or business thereon or unreasonably compromise the safety of the
Leased Real Property or the business or operations thereon; and

  



  

(iii) promptly, upon completion of any phase of Remedial Action, restore any
adversely affected portion of the Leased Real Property to its pre-disturbed
condition to the extent practicable, such that Buyer can continue its
operations in the manner in which such operations were conducted prior to the
commencement of the Remedial Action.

  



  

(e) The Party with the Primary Control Rights shall indemnify and hold the
other party and its Affiliates harmless from any Losses arising from any
negligent act or omission or willful misconduct in performing Remedial
Actions.

  



  

(f) Buyer shall not conduct nor allow any other party under the control of
Buyer to conduct any Phase II or other intrusive environmental testing and/or
sampling during

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

the three (3) year period after the Closing Date, and Seller shall not be
required to provide indemnification under _Section_  11.1 or have
responsibility pursuant to _Section_ 7.12 with respect to environmental
conditions first identified by such testing or sampling, unless such testing
or sampling is (i) required by a demand, complaint, order, directive or
similar enforceable request of a Governmental Authority directed to Buyer
acting within the scope of its jurisdiction or authority; (ii) reasonably
necessary to comply with Environmental Law (including, without limitation,
ISRA); (iii) required to respond to or correct an imminent and substantial
threat of a material risk to human health or the environment, provided Buyer
uses reasonable best efforts to notify Seller in advance of such situation
posing such imminent and substantial threat; (iv) necessary for construction
specifically required to comply with "Current Good Manufacturing Practices"
(as defined in 21 CFR Part 111) (" _cGMP Construction_ "), maintenance or
repair activities on the Leased Real Property, which construction,
maintenance or repair is performed for a bona fide business purpose; (v)
necessary for construction activities which are not cGMP Construction
activities on the Leased Real Property, which construction is performed for a
bona fide business purpose; or (vi) necessary to respond to any reasonable
due diligence request in connection with any bona fide existing or future
issuance of bonds or any other bona fide financing transaction by Buyer or
future sale of all or substantially all of the assets and business of Buyer; 
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer shall give advance written notice of
any testing or sampling proposed to be performed under subsection (ii) above
if relating to an ISRA process that is triggered by an action of Buyer ("
_Buyer-Triggered ISRA_ ") and not by an action of a third party who is not an
Affiliate of or otherwise related to Buyer (such as, by way of example and
not limitation, a landlord in connection with its sale of a Leased Real
Property to a Person other than Buyer or its Affiliates); or subsection (v)
above; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , in the case of a Buyer-Triggered ISRA
(except for a Buyer Triggered ISRA resulting from the expiration and non-
renewal of any lease for a Leased Real Property in accordance with its terms)
or an investigation or assessment conducted pursuant to subsection (v) or
(vi) above, Seller shall only be responsible for environmental conditions
created by the activities of Seller at the Leased Real Property, and only to
the extent Seller is responsible for such matters pursuant to the Seller ISRA
Requirements or _Section_  7.12 of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) At any time after the Closing and prior to the issuance of a NFA by the
NJDEP pursuant to _Section_ 7.11(b) with respect to the facilities subject to
the Seller ISRA Requirements, Buyer agrees to promptly notify Seller
regarding any Release(s) of Hazardous Substance(s) that are material or are
required to be reported under any Environmental Law applicable to Buyers
operations at the Leased Real Property.

  



  

(h) With respect to any Remedial Action or other defense or other resolution
of any claim, event or condition subject to indemnification or reimbursement,
the party with the Primary Control Rights shall provide the party without the
Primary Control Rights with a right to observe and, to the extent set forth
below, participate in such matters, including a right for the party without
Primary Control Rights to (i) receive, review and comment on copies of
written proposals with respect to any proposed Remedial Action and the
results of any sampling and analysis (including any status reports of work in
progress or other submissions) or reports required to be submitted to any
Governmental Authority in connection with conducting the Remedial Actions
prior to submission to any Governmental Authority and/or implementation by
the party with the Primary Control Rights (and the party with Primary Control
Rights shall incorporate any reasonable comments of the other party with
respect to the same); and (ii) attend

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

as an observer, but not participate in, meetings with Governmental
Authorities or other Persons; and in any event Buyer shall be given the right
to consent to any activity that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse impact on any Leased Real Property or the operation of the
Business.

  



  

11.2. _Procedures_. Buyer and Seller agree to observe the procedures set
forth on _Schedule 11.2_ with respect to any claim or the commencement of any
action or proceeding, in each case which may give rise to indemnification
hereunder.

  



  

11.3. _Limitations_. An Aggrieved Party shall not be entitled to recover any
Losses under _Section_ 11.1(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of the Losses
suffered by the Aggrieved Party thereunder shall exceed One Million One
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000) (the " _Minimum Loss_ "), at
which time the indemnification provided under _Section_  11.1(a)(i) shall
apply to all Losses in excess of the Minimum Loss; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the maximum liability of Seller under _Section_  11.1(a)(i) and Sellers
share of the Unknown Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities under _Section_
7.12 (including any obligations of Seller under _Section_ 11.1(a)(ii) with
respect thereto) shall not exceed Eleven Million Five Hundred Dollars
($11,500,000) in the aggregate (the " _Cap_ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the maximum liability provided under this clause shall not apply to
Losses to the extent relating to a breach of Sellers representations and
warranties set forth in the first sentence of _Section_  4.7(a)).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, an
Aggrieved Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Article_ 11
with respect to any matter to the extent such matter has been raised
(pursuant to a Notice of Disagreement or otherwise) in connection with the
determination of Final Net Asset Value under _Section_  3.5. Solely for
purposes of determining the amount of any Loss arising out of a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement (and not for purposes
of determining whether a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
has occurred), references to "Material Adverse Effect" and other materiality
qualifications shall be disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, the first
sentence of this _Section_ 11.3 shall not apply to (x) any claim related to
Taxes, for which _Section_ 7.5 of this Agreement shall provide the sole and
exclusive remedy, or (y) any claim pursuant to _Sections_  11.1(a)(ii) - (ix)
(except with respect to Sellers share of the Unknown Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities under _Section_ 7.12 (including any obligations of
Seller under _Section_ 11.1(a)(ii) with respect thereto)) or _Section_
11.1(b).

  



  

11.4. _Additional Procedures Relating to Environmental Matters_.

  



  

(a) Each party agrees that it shall not, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that each of its Affiliates shall not, directly
or indirectly, communicate orally or in writing with any Governmental
Authority relating to any actual or potential Environmental Liabilities for
which the other party might be responsible under this Agreement; _provided_
that in the event Buyer or Seller believes in good faith that such
communication is either (i) required by any Applicable Law (including any
Environmental Law), or (ii) is otherwise required in the ordinary course of
business in an emergency or exigent situation, Buyer or Seller shall be
entitled to make such communication subject to the provisions of this
_Section_ 11.4(a). With respect to communication under clause (i) above,
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall notify the
potentially Indemnifying Party in advance of making such communication and
shall give such other party a reasonable period of time to either make such

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

communication itself (but in no event exceeding any timeframes for such
reporting under any Applicable Law, including any Environmental Law) or to
provide a written opinion of independent counsel that such communication is
not legally mandated, in which event, the party providing such opinion shall
agree, in writing, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the requesting
party for the failure to so communicate.

  



  

(b) Each partys obligations pursuant to _Section_  7.12 and this _Article_
11 to conduct any Remedial Action shall be deemed satisfied so long as the
remedy (i) complies with the minimum standards enforceable under applicable
Environmental Laws in effect at the time of the performance of the Remedial
Action, (ii) is approved or authorized by Governmental Authorities with
jurisdiction over such matters if such approval or authorization is required
by applicable Environmental Laws, (iii) complies with the minimum standards
set forth in the applicable Leased Real Property lease, if any, (iv) complies
with any enforceable order of a Governmental Authority, and (v) if
applicable, is necessary to respond to any asserted third party claim (the "
_Remediation Standard_ "). The Indemnifying Party may use the most
cost effective method of achieving the Remediation Standard including,
without limitation, the use of commercial, industrial and/or other forms
of non-residential cleanup criteria and the use of environmental land use
restrictions or similar institutional controls to the extent that such
criteria, restrictions and controls (i) are appropriate given the use of the
subject property as such property was used on the Closing Date by Seller and
(ii) do not unreasonably and materially interfere with Buyers operation of
the Business as such Business was operated by Seller on the Closing Date. The
parties agree that, subject to the preceding sentence, if such environmental
land use restrictions or similar institutional controls are approved or
authorized by Governmental Authorities or Environmental Laws, as applicable,
for use on or affecting any Leased Real Property, Seller shall obtain the
prior written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) for any such restrictions or similar controls, and if Buyer
provides such consent, Buyer will execute any required documents and will
cooperate with Seller in (i) obtaining any other signatures or consents
required and (ii) the recording, on the applicable land records, of such
environmental land use restrictions or similar controls.

  



  

(c) Without limiting any other provisions of this Agreement, Sellers
obligation to Buyer under _Section_ 11.1(a)(i), _Section_  11.1(a)(iv)
(Retained Environmental Liabilities) or _Section_ 7.12 with respect to the
completion of any Remedial Action shall be deemed satisfied upon the issuance
of a NFA or similar sign-off issued for the benefit of Buyer and its
successors and assigns by the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
over such matters where such governmental sign-off is required and available
under Environmental Laws to document compliance with the Remediation
Standard.

  



  

11.5. _Indemnification as Sole Remedy_. The indemnification provided in this
_Article_ 11 (and, with respect to Taxes and certain Unknown Pre-Closing
Environmental Liabilities, _Article_ 7), subject to the limitations set forth
herein (and therein), shall to the extent permitted by law be the sole and
exclusive post-Closing remedy for any and all liabilities arising under, or
subject to indemnification or cost-sharing pursuant to, this Agreement,
including without limitation any breach or violation of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein.

  



  

61   

     
   

  



  

11.6. _Net of Insurance; Etc_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under _Sections_  7.5 or 11.1 shall be net of (i)
any amounts recovered by the Aggrieved Party or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any
third party, (ii) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of
reimbursement received as an offset against such Loss (each source named in
clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Collateral Source_ "), and (iii) any specific
accruals or reserves with respect to such Loss (or overstatement of
liabilities with respect to such Loss in respect of actual liability)
included in the Final Net Asset Value. The parties shall take and shall cause
their Affiliates to take all commercially reasonable steps (but shall not be
required to expend significant funds) to pursue such Collateral Sources with
respect to any Loss upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto, _provided_ , _however_ that nothing
in this _Section_ 11.6 shall in any way defer or delay the obligations of
the Indemnifying Party to make all payments required pursuant to _Section_
7.5 or _Article_ 11 in connection with such Loss. The Indemnifying Party may
require an Aggrieved Party to assign the rights to seek recovery from
Collateral Sources pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the Indemnifying
Party shall subrogate to the rights of the Aggrieved Party against any
Collateral Sources to the extent the Indemnifying Party has provided
indemnification to the Aggrieved Party, but in neither case until the Loss in
question has been fully paid; provided, that the Indemnifying Party will then
be responsible for pursuing such recovery at its own expense. If the amount
to be netted hereunder from any payment required under _Section_  7.5 or
_Section_ 11.1 is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any
amount otherwise required to be paid to an Aggrieved Party pursuant to
_Section_ 7.5 or _Article_ 11, the Aggrieved Party shall repay to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, and upon payment in
full of the Loss in question, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would
not have had to pay pursuant to _Section_ 7.5 or _Article_ 11 had such
determination been made at the time of such payment.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 12 
  
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  



  

12.1. _Public Statements_. Prior to the Closing, or afterward, none of the
parties hereto shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without consulting with and obtaining the
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such consent shall not be required where such
release or announcement is required by Applicable Law or pursuant to any
stock listing agreement or the rules of any stock exchange. Subject
to Applicable Law, prior to Closing Seller and Buyer agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other concerning the
means by which the Employees and the customers and suppliers of the Business
are informed of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  



  

12.5. _Waiver_. Any term, provision or condition of this Agreement shall be
waived only in writing (or the time for performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the parties hereto shall be extended only in writing) by the
party that is entitled to the benefits thereof. Failure or delay by a
party hereto on one or more occasions to avail itself of a right conferred by
this Agreement, or the partial exercise thereof, shall in no event be
construed as a waiver of such partys right to enforce said right or any
other right in the future. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by
applicable law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not alternative.

  



  

12.6. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the Operative Agreements may
not be assigned by a party without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto provided that Buyer may assign its rights (but not its
obligations) under this Agreement upon written notice to Seller through
collateral assignment to any lender providing financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that
Buyer shall be entitled, without the prior written consent of Seller,
to assign some or all of its rights under this Agreement and the
Operative Agreements to one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of Buyer,
_provided_  that, prior to any such assignment, Buyer and such subsidiary
shall agree in writing addressed to Seller to be responsible, jointly and
severally, for the liabilities and obligations of Buyer under this Agreement
and the Operative Agreements and such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of
its primary responsibility for such liabilities and obligations hereunder and
thereunder. Other than with respect to any Person entitled to indemnity under
_Article_ 11, this Agreement shall not run to the benefit of or be
enforceable by any Person other than a party to this Agreement and, subject
to the first sentence of this _Section_ 12.6, its successors and assigns.

  



  

12.7. _Seller s Knowledge_. When "to the knowledge of Seller," "to Sellers
knowledge" or any similar phrase is used herein it shall refer to the actual
knowledge, without investigation, of the persons set forth on _Schedule
12.7_.

  



  

12.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Operative
Agreements (including the Disclosure Schedule and the other documents,
certificates and instruments referred to herein, including the
confidentiality agreement, dated September 30, 2004, between Buyer and
Seller) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all other prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

12.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein) shall be governed in all respects,
including validity, interpretation and effect, by the internal laws of the
State of New York. The parties hereto agree that the courts of the State of
New York, New York County, or (if it has or can acquire jurisdiction)
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of each such court, waives any objection to venue and defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought,
agrees that all claims in respect of the action or Proceeding shall be heard
and determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any action or
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby (other than enforcement of judgments obtained therein) in
any other court and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto.

  



  

12.10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts which together shall constitute a single agreement.

  



  

12.11. _Validity_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, then such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if
not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

  



  

12.12. _Disclosure Schedule_. The disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedule shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller
or Buyer of its requirement to be disclosed or to otherwise imply that any
such matter is material for the purposes of this Agreement. Any
item disclosed on a Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure in
all other Disclosure Schedules to which it is readily apparent that such item
is applicable.

  



  

12.13. _Headings_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement
are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or
interpretation.

  



  

12.14. _Bulk Sales Act_. The parties hereby waive compliance with the bulk
sales act or comparable statutory provisions of each applicable jurisdiction.
