\- v -  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 18, 2011 (as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " _Agreement_ "),
is entered into by and among THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (" _Acquiror_ "), NEON ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
OPTIONSXPRESS HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company have agreed to enter into a
business combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the " _Merger_ ")
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Acquiror, Merger Sub
and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders to consummate the Merger and related
transactions provided for herein;

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Acquiror and Merger Sub to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering
into an agreement in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Voting Agreement_
") pursuant to which, subject to the terms thereof, such stockholders have
agreed, among other things, to vote their shares of Company Common Stock (as
defined in _Section 2.1_) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and this Agreement
is intended to be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "
_DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_), Merger Sub
shall merge with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall be the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Company_
") in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws
(as defined in _Section 4.3(b)_) of the State of Delaware.

 

1.2. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date (as defined in _Section 1.4_), the
parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and  executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the
Merger shall become effective upon such filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later date
or time specified in the Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger
becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

 

1.4. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, on (i) the date that is the second Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof,
other than conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing or
(ii) such other date or time as the parties may mutually agree (the date on
which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held
at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10017, unless another place is agreed upon by the parties. For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day that is
not a Saturday, a Sunday or other day on which banking organizations in New
York City are required or authorized by Law to be closed.

1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to
read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and of applicable
Law.

1.6. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance
with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company
and as provided by Law.

 

1.7. _Directors of the Surviving Company_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Company as of the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed (as the
case may be) and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

1.8. _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Company as of the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company, until their
respective successors are duly appointed, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

ARTICLE II

 

CONSIDERATION

 

2.1. _Effect on Company Common Stock and Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any

 



\- 2 -   shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ "):

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are (i) owned directly by the
Company as treasury stock or (ii) owned directly by Acquiror (other than, in
the case of this clause (ii), shares in trust accounts, managed accounts,
brokerage accounts, mutual funds and the like or held by Acquiror as nominee,
in each case for the benefit of customers, or shares held in satisfaction of a
debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and no shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common
Stock_ "), cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any
wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in _Section 4.1(b)_) of the Company or
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror (other than shares in trust
accounts, managed accounts, brokerage accounts, mutual funds and the like or
as nominee, in each case for the benefit of customers, or shares held in
satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall remain outstanding as
shares of the Surviving Company, and no shares of Acquiror Common Stock, cash
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, and subject to _Section
2.2_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive 1.02
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "). For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Merger
Consideration_ " means the right to receive the consideration described in the
preceding sentence pursuant to the Merger with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares as
specified in _Section 2.2_).

(c) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Company.

 

2.2. _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common
Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Acquiror Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in
an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be
converted into Acquiror Common Stock) by the closing price of Acquiror Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as such price is
reported on the screen entitled "Comp/CLOSE/PRICE" on Bloomberg L.P. (or such
other source as may be mutually agreed to by Acquiror and the Company), on
the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. No such holder
shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect
of any fractional share.

 

2.3. _Acquiror Common Stock; Acquiror Preferred Stock_. At and after the
Effective Time, each share of Acquiror Common Stock and each share of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquiror (the " _Acquiror
Preferred Stock_ "), if any, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of
Acquiror Common Stock or Acquiror Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and
shall not be affected by the Merger.

 



\- 3 -  2.4. _Treatment of Options and Other Stock Based Awards_. (a) At the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") issued pursuant to any Company Stock Incentive
Plans (as defined in _Section 2.4(d)_), whether vested or unvested, shall
be assumed by Acquiror and shall be honored by Acquiror in accordance with
its terms following its conversion in the Merger into an option to purchase
Acquiror Common Stock (" _Acquiror Options_ "), except that Acquiror may at
its option decide to cancel in exchange for a cash payment any Company
Options held by Company Employees who reside outside of the United States.
From and after the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be deemed to
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option, a number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Option and (II) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share, at a price per
share equal to (y) the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Option, divided by (z) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code (" _incentive stock
options_ "), the exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in accordance with the method set forth above unless use of such
method will not preserve the status of such options as incentive stock
options, in which case the manner of determination shall be adjusted in a
manner that both complies with Section 424(a) of the Code and results in
the smallest modification in the economic values that otherwise would be
achieved by the holder pursuant to the method set forth above. In all events,
the foregoing substitution of all Company Options with Acquiror Options shall
comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall not cause
any assumption or substitution of Company Options to be treated as a grant of
a new stock right or a change in the form of payment within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. §1.409A  1(6)(5)(v)(D).

(b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
receive shares of the Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value
of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any kind
consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under the Company Stock
Incentive Plans (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred
stock units, performance shares (or units), phantom stock units and dividend
equivalents), other than Company Options (each, a " _Company Stock-Based
Award_ "), which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award
with respect to a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (a " _Converted
Award_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company Stock-Based Award and (y) the Exchange Ratio,
_provided_ , that any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and
the Converted Awards otherwise shall remain subject to the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan and the agreements or
letters evidencing grants thereunder after giving effect to any rights
resulting exclusively from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
pursuant to the Company Stock Incentive Plans and the award agreements
thereunder.

 



\- 4 -  (c) Acquiror shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of Acquiror Options and Converted Awards issued in
substitution for Company Options and Company Stock-Based Awards in accordance
with _Sections 2.4(a)_ and  _2.4(b)_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or
Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms),
with respect to Acquiror Common Stock subject to such Acquiror Options and
other Acquiror equity-based award including restricted stock, restricted stock
units, deferred stock units, performance shares (or units), phantom stock
units and dividend equivalents (each, an " _Acquiror Stock-Based Award_ "),
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Acquiror Options and Acquiror Stock-Based Awards remain
outstanding.

(d) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of
any equity-based right under the Companys 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the
2005 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (each as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time,
and collectively, the " _Company Stock Incentive Plans_ ") and any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof, shall have any right to acquire equity securities of the Company or
the Surviving Company.

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) terminate the
offering period currently in effect under the Company 2005 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") effective as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, (ii) provide that no new offering periods
commence thereafter under the Company ESPP, (iii) provide that there will be
no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made by the
participants therein during the current period and (iv) provide that on the
last day of the current offering period as shortened hereunder, each
participant in the applicable Company ESPP will be credited with the number of
share(s) of Company Common Stock purchased for his or her account(s) under
the applicable Company ESPP in respect of the applicable offering period, as
shortened, in accordance with section 14(b)(ii) of the Company ESPP. In
addition, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the
Company ESPP effective as of the Effective Time.

2.5. _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Acquiror may at any time
change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (A) alter or change the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common
Stock as Merger Consideration, (B) materially impede or delay consummation of
the Merger or (C) adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of the
Company or holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger. In
the event Acquiror elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the change.

2.6. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent (as defined in _Section
3.1_), Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payment under all applicable Tax (as defined in

 



\- 5 -    _Section 4.10(n)(i)_) Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each
holder of Company Common Stock that is to receive a distribution pursuant to
this Agreement will have the sole and exclusive responsibility for the
satisfaction and payment of any such withholding Tax obligations imposed on
Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity on
account of such distribution and (ii) no distribution will be made to or on
behalf of such holder pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such holder
has made arrangements satisfactory to the Acquiror and the Exchange Agent for
the payment and satisfaction of such withholding Tax obligations.

 

2.7. _Certain Adjustments_. The Exchange Ratio shall be subject to appropriate
adjustments from time to time after the date of this Agreement in the event
that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding Acquiror Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities through any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other like changes in
Acquirors capitalization. Acquiror will not effect any such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other like changes in Acquirors capitalization without
ensuring that sufficient shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be authorized
and available for payment as consideration for the Company Common Stock as
contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE III

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION

3.1. _Acquiror to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or promptly after
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent selected by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of (a)
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (b) evidence of shares in
book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ "), for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ , certificates or, at Acquirors option,
evidence of shares of Acquiror Common Stock in book-entry form in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. In addition, Acquiror
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after
the Effective Time, cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 2.2_. With respect to any cash deposited by Acquiror with the
Exchange Agent as described in the immediately preceding sentence, the
Exchange Agent shall invest such cash while held in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Acquiror. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to and be income of Acquiror. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Exchange Fund_ " shall mean all Acquiror Common Stock and
cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.1_.

 

3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive shares of Acquiror
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_ a customary form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the

 



\- 6 -   Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and
such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent in order to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Article II_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares
whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_
shall automatically upon the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which
such Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and
Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Article II_ , and the Book Entry
Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

(b) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock
that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2_ until such holder shall surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this _Article III_. After the surrender of
a Certificate in accordance with this _Article III_ , such holder thereof
entitled to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, with a record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore had
become payable with respect to whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
to such holder in respect of such Certificate.

(c) If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid
or are not payable.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Article III_.

 



\- 7 -  (e) Any portion of the property deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
to  _Section 3.1_ that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company
for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be returned, at the request
of Acquiror, to Acquiror or transferred as directed by Acquiror. Any
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of the Merger
Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Acquiror Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock held by
such stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Acquiror or one of its
Subsidiaries may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror and Merger Sub that,
(i) except as set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter delivered by the
Company to Acquiror prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "), it being understood and agreed that each item in a
particular section of the Company Disclosure Letter applies only to such
section and to any other section to which its relevance is reasonably apparent
and (ii) except as disclosed in the Company Reports (as defined in _Section
4.5(a)_) filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement and
on or after January 1, 2009 (excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk
factor" section thereof or any other disclosures included in such filings
that are cautionary, predictive or forward looking in nature):

4.1. _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease or operate all of its properties, rights and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties,
rights and assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with
respect to the Company or Acquiror, as the case may be, any fact,
circumstance, event, change, effect, development or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other facts, circumstances, events,
changes, effects, developments or occurrences, (x) has had or would be
reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, financial condition or results of operations of such party and its

 



\- 8 -   Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (y) prevents or materially delays or
materially impairs, or would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impair, such partys ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that in determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred pursuant to clause (x) above,
there shall be excluded any effect on the referenced party the cause of which
is (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in Laws of general
applicability or published interpretations thereof by Governmental Entities,
in United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or in
regulatory accounting requirements applicable to the industries in which such
party and its Subsidiaries operate, (ii) the announcement of this Agreement
or compliance with the terms of, or any action of any party to this Agreement
or any of its Subsidiaries expressly required to be taken by it under, this
Agreement, including the loss of customers, employees or vendors demonstrably
arising as a result thereof, (iii) any changes after the date of this
Agreement in general economic conditions in the United States affecting the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, (iv) any changes
after the date of this Agreement in conditions in the financial markets,
credit markets or capital markets in the United States or any other
jurisdiction in which such party or any of its Subsidiaries has substantial
business or operations, including (A) changes in interest rates or currency
exchange rates and (B) any suspension of trading in securities (whether
equity, debt, derivative or hybrid securities) generally on any securities
exchange or over-the-counter market operating in the United States or any
other jurisdiction in which such party or any of its Subsidiaries has
substantial business or operations, (v) any changes after the date of this
Agreement in conditions in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries conduct business, including changes in conditions in the
brokerage industry generally, (vi) any changes after the date of this
Agreement in global or national political conditions in the United States or
any other jurisdiction in which such party or any of its Subsidiaries has
substantial business or operations, (vii) acts of war, sabotage or terrorism
(including any escalation or general worsening of any such acts of war,
sabotage or terrorism) in the United States or any other jurisdiction in
which such party or any of its Subsidiaries has substantial business or
operations and (viii) any actions taken which the other party has in writing
expressly approved, consented to or requested; _provided_ , that the
effect of such changes or actions described in clauses (i) through (viii)
above shall not be excluded to the extent of the disproportionate impact, if
any, they have on such party and its Subsidiaries relative to other
participants in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate, and _provided_ , _further_ , that a decrease in the trading or market
prices of a partys capital stock or any failure to meet public estimates,
projections or internal budgets or forecasts shall not be considered, by
itself, to constitute a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood and
agreed that the facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, developments
or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such decrease or failure that
are not otherwise excluded from the definition of Material Adverse Effect may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or is reasonably
likely to be, a Material Adverse Effect). The certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Company, copies of which have been made available to
Acquiror, are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in full
force and effect as of the date of this Agreement. The Company has delivered
or made available to Acquiror complete and correct copies of all actions
taken by written consent and all minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes or
written consents, the most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings of the
Companys stockholders, board of directors and each committee thereof since
January 1, 2008.

partnership, or other entity and is in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified and (iii)
has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own or lease its
properties, rights and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified to do business or to have such power or authority has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. " _Subsidiary_ " means,
with respect to any person, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability company or any other entity (i) of which such
person or a subsidiary of such person is a general partner or managing member
or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other interests of which

been made available to Acquiror, are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

consists of 250,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 75,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "

outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
As of the date of this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock were held

Since the Capitalization Date and through the date of this Agreement, the
Company has not (x) issued or authorized the issuance of any shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, except for issuances of Company Common Stock as
a result of the exercise of Company Options listed in Section 4.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (y) reserved for issuance any shares of Company

rights. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares in trust accounts, managed accounts, brokerage accounts,
mutual funds and the like or as nominee, in each case for the benefit of
customers, or shares held in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible
securities, preemptive rights, redemption rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units or other similar rights, agreements or
commitments of any character relating to the purchase or issuance of any
shares of the capital stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or
other equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
rights plan or agreement) or equity-based awards, nor is there any other
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) register, issue,
deliver, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (B)
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such subscription, option, warrant,

right, agreement, arrangement or commitment or (C) provide a material amount
of funds to, or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Company has provided to Acquiror a list setting forth, as of the date

Award which is not yet fully vested and the date on which each other award is
scheduled to be settled or become free of restrictions and the price at which
each such Company Option may be exercised (or base price with respect to
stock appreciation rights, if any). The exercise price per share of each
Company Option was, on the applicable date of grant of the Company Option, no
less than the fair market value of one share of Company Common Stock on such
grant date.

(c) Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists the name,
jurisdiction of organization, authorized and outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity interests and record and beneficial owners of such
capital stock or other equity interests for each Subsidiary. The Company owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of or all other equity interests in each of the Companys Subsidiaries,
free and clear of any liens, licenses, pledges, charges, encumbrances, adverse
rights or claims and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ ") other than
Liens granted pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all of such shares or
other equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Credit Agreement_ " shall mean the Companys Credit
Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2010, with Bank of America, N.A. and the
other lenders party thereto.

 



\- 11 -  (d) Except for the ownership of the Companys Subsidiaries and for investments
held in a fiduciary or nominee capacity for the benefit of customers or
acquired after the date of this Agreement in satisfaction of debts previously
contracted in good faith, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
beneficially owns or controls, directly or indirectly, any shares of stock or
other equity interest in any corporation, firm, partnership, joint venture or
other entity.

(e) The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or

matters on which its stockholders may vote, and neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of

voting securities, other equity interests or rights (other than a cashless
exercise of Company Options outstanding, and in accordance with the terms in
effect, as of the date hereof) or to make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other person.

 

(f) As of March 17, 2011, the only principal amount of outstanding
indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and its Subsidiaries (not

authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and,
subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Vote (as
defined in _Section 4.12(b)_), to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Voting Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement have been
duly and validly approved by all necessary corporate and stockholder action
of the Company (subject, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Vote), and no other
corporate or stockholder proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary
to approve this Agreement or the Voting Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement. Each of
this Agreement and the Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general
principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity
and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement, will (i) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of the similar
governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the
consents, approvals and

provision of or the loss of any benefit under, or require redemption or
repurchase or otherwise require the purchase or sale of any securities,
constitute a default under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination, modification or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien (or have any of such
results or effects upon notice or lapse of time, or both) upon any of the
respective properties, rights or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement, contract,
permit, concession, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the

thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the

ARTICLE VII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

7.1. _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate in
preparing and promptly cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the
Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement,
and the Company shall mail or deliver the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective. Acquiror and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any written comments
and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each party shall
cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC. 

 



\- 41 -  (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Acquiror and the
Company agree to cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement (including the Merger) and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities.

 

(c) Acquiror and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Acquiror, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement. Acquiror and the Company shall make any necessary filings
with respect to the Merger under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Advisers Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(d) Acquiror and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Voting Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed
or conditioned.

7.2. _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Acquiror
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records (including Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), and
to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives,
in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to
Acquiror (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of the federal securities laws or other applicable Laws (other
than reports or documents which the Company is not permitted to disclose
under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably request. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any Law applicable to the institution in possession
or control of such information. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Acquiror shall hold all information furnished by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)_ in confidence
to the extent required by,

 



\- 42 -   and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated November 15, 2010, between Acquiror and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

(c) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective representatives
shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the others set forth herein.

7.3. _Stockholder Approval_. (a) The Company shall duly take all lawful
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Company Vote and, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, shall
take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by such
stockholders. The board of directors of the Company shall recommend adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall not directly or
indirectly (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Acquiror
such recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, or in reference
to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in _Section 7.4(b)_), that is
inconsistent with such recommendation (any action or public statement
described in clause (x) or (y) being referred to as a " _Change in Company
Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 7.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on the
adoption of this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of such obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
board of directors of the Company shall have effected a Change in Company
Recommendation, then the board of directors of the Company may submit this
Agreement to the Companys stockholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not
be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of directors of the
Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the
Companys stockholders in the Form S-4 or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by applicable Law. In addition to
the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
9.1_, (i) the Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger and (ii) the Company shall not
(without Acquirors prior written consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or
propose to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Company Stockholders Meeting,
except to the extent required to obtain the Required Company Vote.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company and its board of directors shall be
permitted to effect a Change in Company Recommendation if and only to the
extent that:

(i) the Company and its board of directors have complied in all material
respects with _Section 7.4_,

(ii) the Companys board of directors, based on the advice of its outside
counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and

 



\- 43 -  (iii) if the Companys board of directors intends to effect a Change
in Company Recommendation following and as a result of an Acquisition
Proposal, (A) the Companys board of directors has concluded in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined
in  _Section 7.4(c)_) after giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by Acquiror pursuant to clause (C) below, (B) the Company has
notified Acquiror in writing, at least five (5) Business Days in advance,
of its intention to effect a Change in Company Recommendation (the " _Notice
Period_ "), specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal)
and furnishing to Acquiror a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and all other material
documents and (C) during the Notice Period, and in any event, prior to
effecting such a Change in Company Recommendation, the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with
Acquiror in good faith (to the extent Acquiror desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Acquiror and to again
comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.3(b)_ with respect to such
new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three
(3) Business Days.

(c) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Acquiror shall, in
its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement for
purposes of the Merger.

7.4. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates
and representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys or
accountants retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
(including by way of providing information) the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers (whether firm or hypothetical) or any other efforts or
attempts that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have any discussions with or provide any
confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset
or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into
any agreement or agreement in principle requiring, directly or indirectly,
the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, or (vi) publicly
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.4(a)_, in the event that the Company receives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement and the Companys board of directors concludes in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, the

 



\- 44 -   Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their officers,
directors, employees, agents, affiliates and representatives to, prior to (but
not after) the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (A) take any action
described in clause (ii) above and (B) to the extent permitted by and in
compliance with _Section 9.1(h)_, authorize the execution of a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, in each case to the extent
that its board of directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to providing (or causing
to be provided) any confidential information or data permitted to be provided
pursuant to this sentence, the Company shall have entered into a written
confidentiality agreement with such third party that (1) contains (x) a
customary "standstill" provision prohibiting such person and its affiliates
and their respective representatives, for a period of nine (9) months from
the date of such confidentiality agreement, from acquiring more than 5% of the
voting securities of the Company, making Acquisition Proposals to or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, commencing a tender
or exchange offer or assisting, proposing or knowingly facilitating any of
the foregoing and (y) other terms no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (2) shall not contain any provisions that would
prevent the Company from complying with its obligations under this Agreement;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall contemporaneously provide
Acquiror with any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to such person which was not previously provided to
Acquiror (or its representatives).

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries) relating to any direct or indirect (i) acquisition, purchase or
sale of a business or assets that constitute 20% or more of the consolidated
business, revenues, net income or assets (including stock of the Companys
Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) purchase or sale of, or
tender or exchange offer (including a self-tender offer) for, securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would result in
any person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning securities
representing 20% or more of the equity or total voting power of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or the surviving parent entity in such transaction.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, a
majority of the total voting power or assets of the Company (or a majority of
the total voting power or assets of the resulting or surviving entity of such
transaction or the ultimate parent of such resulting or surviving entity),
which the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and receiving the advice of
its outside counsel, taking into account timing and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions,
conditions to consummation and financing terms), (i) is more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably likely to
be consummated on the terms proposed. 

 



\- 45 -  (d) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any persons other than Acquiror with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal,
including by requiring the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy
any confidential information previously furnished by or on behalf of the
Company thereunder, and will not waive or amend any provision of any such
agreement. The Company will promptly (and in all events within 24 hours)
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal advise Acquiror
of the material terms thereof (including the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Acquiror apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations and the status and terms thereof
(including providing Acquiror with a copy of all material documentation and
correspondence relating thereto) on a reasonably current basis. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall notify Acquiror orally and in
writing within 24 hours after it enters into discussions or negotiations with
another person regarding an Acquisition Proposal, executes and delivers a
confidentiality agreement with another person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, or provides non-public information or data to another
person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
board of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in
Company Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company expressly
and concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

 

7.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and (ii) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party which is required or advisable to be obtained
by the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Acquiror,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to (i) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other
order

 



\- 46 -   adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and (ii)
defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement or
seeking material damages.

7.6. _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) At 12:01 am on the calendar day
immediately following the Closing Date, the Company Employees who are
employees of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company at the Effective Time
shall become eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans sponsored
or maintained by Acquiror, pursuant to the terms thereof (excluding equity-
based plans and defined benefit pension plans) (the " _Acquiror Plans_ ") in
which similarly situated employees of Acquiror participate, to the same extent
as similarly situated employees of Acquiror so participate.

 

(b) With respect to each Acquiror Plan, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of benefits under any post-retirement welfare
benefit plan of Acquiror nor any sabbatical program of Acquiror), service with
the Company or any Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Acquiror; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such
service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations with respect to any Acquiror Plan. Each Acquiror Plan
shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under
the applicable Plan. The Company Employees shall be given credit, to the
extent administratively feasible, for amounts paid under a corresponding
Company or any Subsidiary benefit plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Acquiror Plan during the applicable plan year.

(c) The Company and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained herein with respect to employees, officers, directors, consultants
and independent contractors are included for the sole benefit of the Company
and Acquiror and shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including
Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with Acquiror
or any of its affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Acquiror
from amending, modifying or terminating after the Effective Date any Plan
maintained or sponsored by the Company.

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary
to terminate, immediately prior to the Effective Time, any Plan that is
intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined contribution plan under Code
Section 401(k) (a " _401(k) Plan_ "), in which case the Company Employees
shall, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, be fully vested in
any unvested amounts contained in their accounts under the 401(k) Plan.
Taking into account the provisions of _Section 7.6(b)_ above, then-current
eligible Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in an Acquiror
Plan that corresponds to the 401(k) Plan either at 12:01 am on the calendar
day immediately following the Closing Date or on the first calendar day of the
month following the month of the Effective Time, as determined by Acquiror. As
soon as practicable following IRS approval of the termination of the 401(k)
Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed and Acquiror shall permit the
employees of the Company employed by the

 



\- 47 -   Surviving Company to roll any eligible rollover distributions (and eligible
loans under the Companys 401(k) Plan) over into the corresponding Acquiror
Plan.

 

(e) Upon reasonable advance notice, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
shall take all actions necessary (including cooperation with Acquiror in the
provision of notices, the making of any required filings with the applicable
Governmental Entity, and the distribution of enrollment information) to
terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, any health and welfare
Plan identified by Acquiror, and to permit Company Employees, at 12:01 am on
the calendar day immediately following the Closing Date, to be eligible to
commence participation in a corresponding Acquiror Plan.

 

7.7. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, in the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or the Voting Agreement,
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and all
actions taken by an Indemnified Party in connection herewith or therewith, in
each case in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether in any case asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Company to
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified
Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to
each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking from such Indemnified
Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 7.7_, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Acquiror in writing thereof, _provided_ , that the failure to so notify shall
not affect the obligations of Acquiror under this _Section 7.7_ except (and
only) to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices Acquiror.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and
directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered
by the directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies
maintained by Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that
Acquirors directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies
provide at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are, in the aggregate, not materially less advantageous to such
directors and officers of the Company than the terms and conditions of the
existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
will Acquiror be required to expend, in the

 



\- 48 -   aggregate and on an annual basis, an amount (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") in
excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance, which current premiums are set forth in Section 7.7(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and if Acquiror is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this _Section 7.7(b)_ for an amount per year equal to
or less than the Insurance Amount, Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as may be available for the
Insurance Amount. The provisions of this _Section 7.7(b)_ shall be deemed to
have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by Acquiror or by
the Company (with Acquirors consent), which policies provide the persons
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
immediately prior to the Effective Time with coverage for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time.
If such prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time with Acquirors consent, Acquiror shall maintain such policies
in full force and effect and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives.

 

7.8. _Advice of Changes_. Acquiror and the Company shall promptly advise the
other of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with
other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the

breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a
right.

similar Law or any takeover-related provision in the Companys certificate of

the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.14. _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement
intend that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section

would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as
a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to this
Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to deliver representation
letters referred to in  _Sections 8.2(c)_ and _8.3(c)_ hereof for the

of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Acquiror or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (D) concurrently with any
termination pursuant to this _Section 9.1(h)_, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior

 



\- 54 -   Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this

of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i)

termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, none of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the
Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that in no event shall any party hereto be liable for any
punitive damages. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful and material
breach_ " shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive)
that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause
a breach of this Agreement.

Acquirors rights under this Agreement), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the sum of $41,900,000 (the " _Termination Payment_ ") if

9.1(e)_ or (III) by either Acquiror or the Company pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_ without a vote of the stockholders of the Company contemplated by
this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting having occurred, and in the
case of clauses (I), (II) or (III) above, an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated
or made known to the senior management or board of directors of the Company
(or any person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made publicly
known an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
Proposal) at any

 



\- 55 -   time after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, in the case of clause (II), or the date of
termination, in the case of clauses (I) or (III), and (B) within 12 months
after such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction
contemplated by, any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same one as
made prior to the date of such Company Stockholder Meeting or termination, as
the case may be), then the Company shall pay to Acquiror the Termination
Payment on the date of such execution or consummation, _provided_ , _however_
, that for the purpose of this clause (B), all references in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal to "20% or more" shall instead refer to "50% or more".

(c) The Company and Acquiror agree that the agreements contained in _Section
9.2(b)_ are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to
pay Acquiror the amounts due under such _Section 9.2(b)_ within the time
periods specified in such section, the Company shall pay the costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Acquiror
in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to
collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in the New York City edition of the _The_ _Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

 

9.3. _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment
shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

9.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the
action, suit or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay
the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled
pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each of
Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all rights to trial
by jury in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company further irrevocably consents
to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement by the
mailing of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party
at its address specified pursuant to _Section 10.3_, such service of process
to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail.

(c) Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company expressly acknowledges that
the foregoing waivers are intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the
State of Delaware and of the United States of America; _provided_ , that
consent by the parties to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section
10.7_ is solely for the purpose referred to in this _Section 10.7_ and shall
not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of
Delaware other than for such purpose.

 

10.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction,
and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort

 



\- 59 -   to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the
original intent of the parties.

10.9. _Publicity_. Acquiror and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement as
may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules and
regulations of the NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Without limiting the
preceding sentence, Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate to develop all
public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Voting Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party. In addition,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (a) consult with Acquiror regarding
communications with customers, stockholders, prospective investors and
employees related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement, (b) provide Acquiror with stockholder lists of the Company
from time to time as requested by Acquiror and (c) allow and facilitate
Acquiror contact with stockholders of the Company and other prospective
investors.

 

10.10. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 7.7_ hereof,
this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.

10.11. _Construction_. This Agreement and any documents or instruments
delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall be construed without
regard to the identity of the person who drafted the various provisions of
the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such other documents
and instruments shall be construed as though all of the parties participated
equally in the drafting of the same. Consequently, the parties acknowledge
and agree that any rule of construction that a document is to be construed
against the drafting party shall not be applicable either to this Agreement or
such other documents and instruments.

 

10.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the provisions contained in this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any bond,
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof (including consummation of the Merger), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any

 



\- 60 -   other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.
