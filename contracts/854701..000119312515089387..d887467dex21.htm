outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled
Company Shares and (B) any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in _Section 2.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner
provided in _Section 2.10_).

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Sub or by any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Company, in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Cancelled Company Shares"), shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock of
Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Acquisition Sub shall
thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the granting or other issuance of Company Options, Company
SARs or Company Restricted Stock Units in the ordinary course of business),
reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither
have voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, but shall be entitled only to
such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Company
Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and
each Company

 



-18-  Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however,_ that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL
shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in  _Section 2.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to consult with
the Company concerning and to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands
for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 

(d) _Company Options_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company or any holder of such Company Options, each Company Option
that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be treated as follows:

 

(i) Each Company Option that is outstanding and vested as of the Effective
Time (including a Company Option that vests by its terms at the Effective
Time) (a "Vested Company Option") shall be cancelled and terminated as of the
Effective Time and the holder thereof shall receive, subject to _Section
2.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration _less_ the per share exercise price
of such Vested Company Option (the "Vested Option Consideration") (it being
understood and agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to
the Company by the holder of a Company Option). The Company shall pay to each
holder of Vested Company Options the Vested Option Consideration, if any,
described in the immediately preceding sentence (through the Companys or a
Company Subsidiarys payroll system, or the Companys or a Company
Subsidiarys equity award administrator, as may be applicable and in
accordance with the Companys payroll practices for service providers located
outside of the United States) on either (A) the first (1st) regularly
scheduled payroll after the Closing or (B) if such first (1st) payroll is
scheduled for payment prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
Closing, the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing, in
any such case, consistent with past practices, including accounting for all
applicable withholding.

 



-19- (ii) Each Company Option that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective
Time and not described in _Section 2.7(d)(i)_ (an "Unvested Company Option")
shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to _Section 2.8(e)_, an
amount of cash determined by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration _less_ the per
share exercise price of such Unvested Company Option (the "Unvested Option
Consideration"). The Unvested Option Consideration will be subject to the same
vesting restrictions and continued service requirements (collectively, the
"Continuing Obligations") applicable to the Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for administrative changes
that are not adverse to the holder of the Unvested Company Option or to which
the holder consents. Payment of the Unvested Option Consideration in respect
of an Unvested Company Option shall be made, subject to such terms and
conditions, on the vesting dates applicable to the Unvested Company Option, as
described in this Section 2.7(d).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the per share exercise price of any
Company Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be cancelled without any payment or consideration and all rights
with respect to such Company Option shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Company SARs_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company or any holder of such Company SAR each Company SAR that
remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as follows:

 

(i) Each Company SAR that is outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time
(including a Company SAR that vests by its terms at the Effective Time) (a
"Vested Company SAR") shall be cancelled and Terminated as of the Effective
Time and the holder thereof shall receive, subject to _Section 2.8(e)_, an
amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Vested Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the
Merger Consideration _less_ the base price of such Vested Company SAR (the
"Vested SAR Consideration"). The Company shall pay to each holder of Vested
Company SAR the Vested SAR Consideration, if any, described in the immediately
preceding sentence (through the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys payroll
system, or the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys equity award administrator,
as may be applicable and in accordance with the Companys payroll practices
for service providers located outside of the United States) on either (A) the
first (1st) regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing or (B) if such
first (1st) payroll is scheduled for payment prior to the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the Closing, the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll
after the Closing, in any such case, consistent with past practices, including
accounting for all applicable withholding.

 

(ii) Each Company SAR that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective
Time and not described in _Section 2.7(e)(i)_ (an "Unvested Company SAR")
shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to _Section 2.8(e)_, an
amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company

 



-20-  Common Stock subject to the Unvested Company SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Merger Consideration _less_ the base price of
such Unvested Company SAR (the "Unvested SAR Consideration"). The Unvested
SAR Consideration will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions
applicable to the SARs immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
Continuing Obligations, except for administrative changes that are not
adverse to the holder of the SAR or to which the holder consents. Payment of
the Unvested SAR Consideration shall be made, subject to such terms and
conditions, on the vesting dates applicable to the Unvested Company SAR.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the base price of any Company SAR
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company SAR shall be
cancelled without any payment or consideration and all rights with respect to
such Company SAR shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of such Company Restricted
Stock Units, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as follows:

 

(i) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding and vests and
becomes settleable by its terms at the Effective Time (a "Vested Restricted
Stock Unit") shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and
the holder thereof shall receive, subject to _Section 2.8(e)_, an amount in
cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Vested Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y)
the Merger Consideration (the "Restricted Stock Unit Consideration"). The
Company shall pay to each holder of Vested Restricted Stock Unit the
Restricted Stock Unit Consideration described in the immediately preceding
sentence (through the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys payroll system, or
the Companys or a Company Subsidiarys equity award administrator, as may be
applicable and in accordance with the Companys payroll practices for service
providers located outside of the United States) on either (A) the first (1st)
regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing or (B) if such first (1st)
payroll is scheduled for payment prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the Closing, the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing,
in any such case, consistent with past practices, including accounting for all
applicable withholding.

 

(ii) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding and unvested as of
the Effective Time and not described in  _Section 2.7(f)(i)_ (an "Unvested
Restricted Stock Unit") shall be converted into the right to receive, subject
to _Section 2.8(e)_, an amount of cash determined by _multiplying_ (x)
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Unvested Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_
(y) the Merger Consideration (the "Unvested Restricted Stock Unit
Consideration"). The Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration will be
subject to the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Restricted
Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the Continuing
Obligations, except for administrative changes that are not adverse to

 



-21-  the holder of the Restricted Stock Unit or to which the holder consents.
Payment of the Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration shall be made,
subject to such terms and conditions, on the vesting dates applicable to the
Restricted Stock Units as described in this _Section 2.7(f)_.

(g) The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by _Sections 2.7(d)_, _(e)_ and _(f)_ under all
Company Option, Company SAR and Company Restricted Stock Unit agreements and
any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all
required notices and obtaining any required consent. Within three (3) Business
Days after the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to each of the holders of Vested Company Options,
Vested Company SARs and Vested Restricted Stock Units, the applicable Vested
Company Option Consideration, Vested SAR Consideration and Restricted Stock
Unit Consideration (through the Surviving Corporations or a Surviving
Corporation Subsidiarys payroll system, or the Surviving Corporations or a
Surviving Corporations Subsidiary equity award administrator, as may be
applicable and in accordance with the Companys payroll practices for service
providers located outside of the United States) on either (A) the first (1st)
regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing or (B) if such first (1st)
payroll is scheduled for payment prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the Closing, the second (2nd) regularly scheduled payroll after the Closing,
in any such case, consistent with past practices, including accounting for
all applicable withholding.

(h) _Company ESPP_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
will not establish any new offering period under the Company ESPP. The Company
shall take all actions necessary so that (i) the Company ESPP shall terminate
for no consideration prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the Offering Period
(as defined in the Company ESPP) ongoing as the date of this Agreement will be
cancelled prior to the Effective Time and (iii) all amounts withheld by the
Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been
used to purchase Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time will be
returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP.

 

(i) _Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all actions necessary (including adopting such resolutions of the Company
Board (or any appropriate committee thereof) and providing all required
notices in connection therewith) to terminate each of the Company Stock Plans
and to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right
with respect to outstanding equity-based awards except as provided in
_Sections 2.7(d), (e) and (f)_. For avoidance of doubt, but without prejudice
to the rights to receive Unvested Option Consideration, Unvested SAR
Consideration and Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration as set forth
in this _Section 2.7_, Parent will not assume any Company Options, Company
SARs or Company Restricted Stock Units.

 



-22- 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or immediately following the Closing, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to
which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Article
II_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of
America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund").
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by this _Article II_, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make such payments
contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated
Shares"), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_ (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Upon surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate that were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of
such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to

 



-23-   _Section 2.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment
Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any
transfer taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company SARs and Company
Restricted Stock Units such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted, withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange

 



-24-  pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_ shall thereafter look for
payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 2.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms
of this  _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement
procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_.

 

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_; 
_provided_ that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as
condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
customary and reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

2.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

 



-25- ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on

with _Section 9.12_, or (ii) except in respect of _Section 3.4_ (Non-
Contravention), _Section 3.5_ (Required Governmental Approvals), _Section
3.6_ (Company Capitalization) and _Section 3.7_ (Subsidiaries), as disclosed
in any Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company
on or after December 11, 2014 but prior to the date hereof that are publicly
available (other than (x) disclosures under the captions "Risk Factors,"
"Forward-Looking Statements," or similar precautionary sections and (y) any
other disclosures that are predictive, cautionary, forward-looking or non-
specific in nature, and in any case only to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable
to any section or subsection of this Article III), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law, and has
the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation of its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws. The Company has delivered to Parent correct and
complete copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws as amended as
of the date of this Agreement.

 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its covenants and obligations hereunder
and, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, and no additional corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally, and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Enforceability
Limitations").

 



-26- 3.3 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Requisite
Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company Capital Stock that is necessary under applicable Law and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws to adopt this Agreement and
consummate the Merger.

3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (b) subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in _Section
3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, violate, conflict with, or result in
the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, or result in the termination
of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of
termination or acceleration under, any Contract to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party; (c) assuming the Consents referred to in
_Section 3.5_ are obtained or made and, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate
or conflict with any Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any of their properties or assets are bound; or (d)
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for such violations,
conflicts, defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens which would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations hereunder. The Company has made available to Parent
correct and complete copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that
have not yet been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of stockholders,
the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2013, other than
the minutes of those meetings of the Board of Directors and committees thereof
at which the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any prior
negotiations with any third parties in respect of any similar transactions
were discussed.

 

3.5 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing being referred to herein as a "Consent"), any Governmental Authority
is required on the part of the Company (including on behalf of or in respect
of any of its Subsidiaries) in connection with the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except:

 

(a) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental
Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of states in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business;

 



-27- (b) such filings and approvals as may be required by any federal or state

Foreign Investment and Security Act of 2007 ("FINSA");

(e) the Taiwan Approvals; and

 

(f) such other Consents, the failure of which to obtain would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect

connection with any termination of employment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
with or without good reason, or with or without cause, as a result of
disability, death, retirement, or otherwise) or any other employment-related

payable, or required to be provided, to any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (2) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such current or former

terminate any Employee Plan.

(l) Except as required by applicable Law or the terms of any Employee Plans as

-54- 4.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company (i) an executed letter of commitment
(the "Bank Letter") from the financial institution named therein (the
"Lender"), for the purpose of funding a portion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing," _provided_ that for
purposes of this Agreement, the Debt Financing shall also include, after the
date hereof, to the extent alternative financing from alternative financial
institutions is obtained in accordance with this Agreement, any such
alternative financing), and (ii) an executed equity commitment letter from
each of the Sponsors (each, an "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with
the Bank Letter, the "Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which, and subject
only to the terms and conditions expressly set forth therein, each Sponsor
has committed to invest the amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing"
and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the investing of the
full amount of the Financing, as of the date of this Agreement, other than as
set forth in the Commitment Letters. The Equity Commitment Letter provides,
and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary
thereof.

(b) As of the date hereof (i) each of the Commitment Letters is in full force
and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect; (ii) each of the Commitment Letters,
in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and Acquisition Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent and Acquisition Sub, the
other parties thereto (as applicable and subject to the terms thereof and to
the Enforceability Limitations); and (iii) no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub under any term, or a failure
of any condition, of any of the Commitment Letters or otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the
date hereof, subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company contained in _Article III_ hereof, and the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_ hereof, neither
Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition contained in any of the
Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by it or that any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby will be unavailable to Parent and Acquisition
Sub at the Effective Time. Parent and Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment
Letters that are due and payable on or before the date of this Agreement.

(c) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, as of the date hereof, the aggregate net proceeds from
the Financing provided under the Commitment Letters are sufficient to fund all
of the amounts required to be provided by Parent and/or Acquisition Sub for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of all amounts required to be paid
pursuant to  _Article II_, any

 



-55-  repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries required in connection with
the Merger, and the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) The obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under this Agreement are
not contingent in any respect upon the funding of the amounts contemplated to
be funded pursuant to the Commitment Letters. The obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub under this Agreement are not subject to any
conditions regarding Parents, Acquisition Subs, their respective
Affiliates, or any other Persons ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4.11 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Sponsor is entering
into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, any Sponsor, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is Solvent as of the date of
this Agreement, and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing, the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration,
the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
payment of all related fees and expenses, be Solvent at the Effective Time. As
used in this _Section 4.11_, the term "Solvent" means, with respect to a
particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair
valuation, of Parent and Acquisition Sub (on a consolidated basis) will exceed
their debts (on a consolidated basis), (b) Parent and Acquisition Sub (on a
consolidated basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and does
not believe that it will incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
such debts mature, and (c) Parent and Acquisition Sub (on a consolidated
basis) has reasonably sufficient capital with which to conduct its business.
For purposes of this _Section 4.11_, "debt" means any liability on a claim,
and "claim" means any (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right is
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and
(ii) any right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such
breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured.

 

4.12 _Non-Reliance; Exclusivity of Representations_.

 

(a) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by
Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, Parent
and Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives and advisors have received and
may continue to receive after the date hereof (including pursuant to _Section
6.8_) from the Company and its Affiliates, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking

 



-56-  information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, that Parent and Acquisition Sub are making
their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information or business plans). Accordingly, Parent and Acquisition
Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives or advisors, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
statements or business plans), unless any information contained in such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets is also
expressly contained in any of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
_Article IV_, (a) neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub (or any other Person)
makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
businesses or operations or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) no Person has been authorized by
Parent or Acquisition Sub to make any representation or warranty relating to
Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates or any of their
respective businesses or operations or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including as to the
accuracy or completeness thereof, and if made, such representation or
warranty must not be relied upon by the Company or any of its Affiliates or
any Representatives of any of the foregoing as having been authorized by
Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates (or any other Person on
their behalf).

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and terminate such Persons access to
any data room containing the Companys confidential information, and shall as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days)
request the return from all such Persons or the destruction by such Persons of
all copies of confidential information previously provided to such Persons by
the Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.2(c)_, at all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of (A) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and (B) the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not,
nor shall they authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, controlled affiliates, or any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other authorized agent or
representative retained by any of them (collectively, "Representatives")
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,
an Acquisition Proposal,

 



-61-  (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any
designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) any non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any designees of Parent or Acquisition Sub) access
to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

announcement of, or the intent to encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate
or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) enter into any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives from any Person a _bona fide,_
written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal not involving a breach of
_Section 5.2(b)_ that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
either constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through the Companys
Representatives, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person and/or (ii) furnish to such Person any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and/or afford such Person
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or the personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case under this clause (ii) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, _provided_ that contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public
information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by
the Company to Parent; _provided, however_ , that in the case of each action
taken pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) or (ii), prior to taking such
action, (A) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, and (B) the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity
of such Person and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (unless
such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in which case the Company shall
give Parent a copy thereof) and of the Companys intention to participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information
to, such Person (and shall include with such notice copies of any written
materials received from or on behalf of such Person in connection with or
relating to such Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Companys
Subsidiaries or its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.2_ by the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, amend, modify or waive
any rights under, or release any Person (other than Parent and Acquisition
Sub) from, any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Person, on the other,
unless the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof determines
in good faith (after

 



-62-  consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify
Parent of any receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, including with such notice the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (and shall
include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on
behalf of such Person in connection with or relating to such Acquisition
Proposal (including any financial terms)). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Companys cooperation in implementing the Taiwan Plan, including
any discussions or actions taken in connection with any Taiwan Divestiture at
the request of Parent, be a violation or breach of its covenants under this
_Section 5.2_, and the Taiwan Divestiture shall not constitute
an Acquisition Proposal under this Agreement.

required under applicable Law or as appropriate to protect confidential
business information.

 

(d) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not contemplated by
this _Section 6.2_ are required to be or should be made, and whether any
other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not contemplated by this
_Section 6.2_ are required to be or should be obtained, from any
Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings, furnish
information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the parties
determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all
reasonable steps which it is capable of taking to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by the FTC, the DOJ,
or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and, in any
event, prior to the Termination Date.

 

(f) With respect to the CFIUS Approval:

 

(i) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all
reasonable steps which it is capable of taking to obtain the CFIUS Approval.

 



-66- (ii) In furtherance of the foregoing, if and to the extent required to obtain
the CFIUS Approval, Parent agrees to undertake any reasonable mitigation
efforts, including the following: propose, negotiate, offer to commit and
effect, by consent decree or otherwise, the termination or cancellation of all
or a portion of sales contracts with customers in the United States for
Company Products and the sale, license, assignment, transfer or other
divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of the Company;
_provided_ that any such mitigation efforts shall not be required to the
extent the Contracts, Company Products, assets and businesses affected by such
mitigation efforts, including any such terminated or cancelled contracts or
sold, licensed, assigned, transferred, divested or dispossessed assets,
are responsible for revenues, in the aggregate, in excess of $5,000,000 per
year, or such mitigation efforts otherwise have an adverse effect on the
Parent or the Company (whether before or after the Closing) that is material
in any respect. The Company, if (and only if) requested by Parent, shall
agree to effect the foregoing so long as the effect thereof is binding upon
the Company only if the Effective Time occurs.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as provided in _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_ and  _Section 6.2(h)_,
none of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company shall be required to (and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, without first obtaining
Parents prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in Parents
sole discretion, shall, or shall offer or agree to):

(i) propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, license, assignment, transfer or other
divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

 

(ii) offer to take or offer to commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, services or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries and the Company
and its Subsidiaries; or

(iii) take any other actions that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or that
would be materially adverse to Parent (whether before or after the Closing).

 

(h) _Taiwan Plan._

(i) Parent and the Company agree that, following the date hereof, they will
cooperate in good faith to formulate a detailed plan providing for the
restructuring of certain aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries business
pursuant to which the Merger would be permitted to be consummated under the
Laws of the Republic of China (the "Taiwan Plan"). The Taiwan Plan may, to the
extent required, provide for, without limitation, (i) the divestiture or
disposition of certain assets (including Subsidiaries) of the Company, (ii)
the negotiation, execution and performance of acquisition agreements with
third parties to acquire such assets (including pursuant to the Taiwan
Divestiture, as described below) (iii) the transfer or reassignment of
certain employees and/or independent contractors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (iv) the reclassification of certain industry codes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Laws of the Republic of China;
_provided_ that any such actions shall

 



-67-  become binding on the Company no earlier than, and contingent upon, the
consummation of the Merger. Once agreed, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to implement the steps contemplated by the Taiwan Plan over which
Parent exercises control. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent, and to implement the steps contemplated by the Taiwan
Plan, to the extent approved by Parent, in order to ensure that the Taiwan
Plan can be fully effectuated as soon as practicable following the Closing.

(ii) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge and agree that in the event the parties are unable to formulate
the Taiwan Plan in a manner whereby a restructuring of the Company and its
Subsidiaries would enable the Merger to be consummated in accordance with the
Laws of the Republic of China, the parties shall cooperate to arrange the sale
of the Companys Subsidiaries incorporated in Taiwan to a bona fide, credit-
worthy third party unaffiliated with Parent, such sale to be conditioned upon,
and become effective solely upon or after, the consummation of the Merger
(such sale, the "Taiwan Divestiture", and such purchaser, the "Taiwan
Purchaser"). Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to identify
and engage with any such Taiwan Purchaser and negotiate and execute any
definitive agreements necessary for such Taiwan Purchaser to effectuate the
Taiwan Divestiture, _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to execute
any such definitive agreements which are not on commercially reasonable
terms. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
Parents requests to consummate the Taiwan Divestiture, including meeting with
and providing information about the Company and its business and operations
to any Taiwan Purchaser.

(iii) Following Parents identification and engagement of a Taiwan Purchaser,
and following written agreement with such Taiwan Purchaser on all material
terms necessary to effectuate the Taiwan Divestiture with such Taiwan
Purchaser, each in full compliance with the terms of this _Section 6.2(h)_,
Parent shall notify the relevant Governmental Authorities of the Republic of
China of such actions and shall file for the approval thereof. In the event
such Government Authorities provide written notice to the effect that (i) such
Governmental Authorities do not approve the consummation of such Taiwan
Divestiture on the terms so submitted or that such Taiwan Divestiture would be
illegal in the Republic of China or (ii) such Governmental Authorities would
not approve the Merger notwithstanding the consummation of such Taiwan
Divestiture or the consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the
consummation of such Taiwan Divestiture, would be illegal in the Republic of
China, such notice shall be deemed a "Taiwan Rejection Notice" hereunder.

(iv) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise one another of any
communications to or from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
implementation of the Taiwan Plan (including the Taiwan Divestiture), and
shall provide one another with copies of any such communications to the extent
they are in written form.

 

(v) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval from the
government of the Republic of China of the implementation and effectuation of
the Taiwan Plan (including, if necessary, the Taiwan Divestiture) or
confirmation that the Merger can be consummated in accordance with the Laws of
the Republic of China, together with any other Taiwan Approvals.

 



-68- 6.3 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days)
following the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC in
preliminary form the Proxy Statement for use in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders for use at the Company
Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq. Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall furnish in writing to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Sub as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any of their respective directors,
officers or other Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or
Acquisition Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared
and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the
SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the filing thereof with
the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or that it
has no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement.

(c) Unless the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, (i) the Company shall not
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto,
and (ii) the Company shall not correspond or otherwise communicate with the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, in any such case
referenced in the preceding clause (i) or (ii) without providing Parent and
Acquisition Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon or
participate therein, as the case may be, and the Company shall consider
all such comments by Parent in good faith.

(d) The Company shall advise Parent and Acquisition Sub, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff
for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any receipt of comments
from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, or any receipt of a request
by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith,
and shall provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff
thereof, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
also shall provide Parent with copies of any written comments or responses to
be submitted by the Company in response to any comments or inquiries from the
SEC or the staff thereof and shall provide Parent a reasonable 

 



-69-  opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written response to any
such written comments of the SEC or its staff relating to the Proxy Statement.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable.

(e) Unless the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date hereof for the purpose of voting to
approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL. Once the Company has
established the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting the Company
shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of Parent,
unless required by applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall hold the Company Stockholder Meeting no later
than 45 calendar days following the date the dissemination of the Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders is commenced; _provided_ , _however_ ,
nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
Company Stockholder Meeting:

(i) For sequential periods of up to five (5) Business Days each, if there are
holders of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or
represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a
quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting;

 

(ii) For so long as the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or its
staff; or

(iii) For one time only, for up to three (3) weeks, if the Company Board or
any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate
to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to
(A) give Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made
available to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials
with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Company Board
Recommendation Change), or (B) to enable the additional time to solicit
proxies from Company Stockholders.

 

(b) Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger),
and any matters related thereto, shall be the only matters which the Company
shall propose to be acted on at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



-70- (c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section
8.1_, the Company shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in
favor of the approval of the Merger in accordance with Delaware Law, submit
the Merger for approval of the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting and, unless the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof
shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant _Section
6.5(b)_, use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder
Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and for the
avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, no Company Board Recommendation Change shall obviate or
otherwise affect the obligation of the Company to call and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting pursuant to and in accordance with this  _Section 6.4_.

6.5 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.5(c)_, the Company Board shall make the Company
Board Recommendation.

 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x) withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (y) approve, endorse or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal or (z) fail to recommend against acceptance of any
tender offer or exchange offer for shares of the Company Common Stock within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer (each of clauses
(x), (y) and (z), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); _provided,
however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or
any substantially similar communication, shall not be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof may make a Company
Board Recommendation Change if and only if:

 

(i) (A) the Company has received an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and not involving a breach of
_Section 5.2(b)_;

(B) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

 



-71- (C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of the Superior
Proposal, including providing Parent with the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal and a copy of the then-current forms of all of the
relevant proposed transaction documents related thereto, including definitive
agreements (including financing agreements, if any) with respect to such
Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), _provided_ that with respect
to any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal, Parent shall be entitled to a new written notice by the
Company (a "Superior Proposal Amendment Notice");

(D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning as
soon as practicable on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such
Superior Proposal Notice or such Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as
applicable, and ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on, in the case of a Superior
Proposal Notice, the fourth (4th) day following the day of such delivery or,
in the case of a Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, the second (2nd) day
following the day of such delivery ( _provided_ that such two (2) day period
shall be extended if applicable through the end of the original four (4) day
period);

(E) the Company has during such four (4) day period or such two (2) day
period, as applicable, negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors
to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) with respect to proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

 

(F) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four (4) day
period or such two (2) day period, as applicable, a written, binding and
irrevocable offer to modify the terms of this Agreement, the Company Board
and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice or such
Superior Proposal Amendment Notice, as applicable, still constitutes a
Superior Proposal; or

 

(ii) (A) an Intervening Event has occurred;

 

(B) the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in light of
such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law;

 

(C) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing of such Intervening
Event, including a reasonable description of such Intervening Event (an
"Intervening Event Notice");

(D) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss with Parents Representatives the Intervening Event and
any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
during the period

 



-72-  beginning as soon as practicable on the day of delivery by the Company to
Parent of such Intervening Event Notice and ending at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time
on the fourth (4th) day following the day of such delivery;

(E) the Company has during such four (4) day period negotiated, and caused
its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to proposed adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure to make
such Company Board Recommendation Change is no longer a breach of the Company
Boards fiduciary duties; and

 

(F) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such four (4) day
period a written and binding offer to modify the terms of this Agreement, the
Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in
good faith, after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in light of
such Intervening Event would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware Law.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law; _provided_
that, (x) clause (ii) of this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall not in and of itself be
deemed to permit the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change that would not otherwise be
permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.5_, and (y) in either such case,
any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the Company Board and/or any
authorized committee thereof will be subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including the provisions of _Section 6.5_ and _Article
VIII_.

 

6.6 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press
release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. None of the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand,
shall issue any public release or make any public announcement concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to
which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance
(it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the

 



-73-  disclosing party); _provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.6_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made by the Company in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal, a Company Board Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal.

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors,
business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that the Company may
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the
extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) access to
such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege applicable to such documents or information, or (iii) access to
a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party
the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract; and
_provided further, however_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by
Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
this _Section 6.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the
rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder. In the
event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on
the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or to waive such a
privilege, including, to the extent practicable, by providing such
information in redacted form as necessary to preserve such a privilege or
comply with such Law or otherwise make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, to the extent possible. Any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this  _Section 6.8_ shall be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction
to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any
access to the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable Lease and the Companys
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive Phase 1 or Phase 2

 



-74-  environmental assessments or other invasive testing. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.8_. Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information.

 

6.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all (i) indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (x) any of their respective current or former directors
and officers as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of such
agreements as in effect as of the date hereof, and (y) any person who becomes
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and executes an indemnification agreement on terms no less
favorable to the Company and no more favorable to such person than the current
form of indemnification agreement with its directors that has been made
available to Parent (the "Indemnified Persons") and (ii) indemnification,
expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement. In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
Indemnified Persons except as required by applicable Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.10(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the

 



-75-  Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim
for indemnification under this _Section 6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in
such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance,
prior to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly
following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation
expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by
such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in
a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to
object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder
with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall
elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of no more than one separate counsel retained by an Indemnified
Person (and reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation), promptly
after statements therefor are received, only if (A) the Surviving Corporation
has not elected to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry or (B) an Indemnified Person shall have reasonably
concluded that there are or are reasonably likely to be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to
the Surviving Corporation, as the indemnifying party, or that there exists or
is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest, in either case, that
would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified
Person for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Person and the
Surviving Corporation, as the indemnifying party, and (iv) no Indemnified
Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior
express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 6.10(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or

 



-76-  otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 6.10(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 6.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter);  _provided, however,_
that, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year
"tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance provided that, without the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not expend per year coverage
in excess of the Maximum Annual Premium for such "tail" policy. In the event
that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
otherwise elects to purchase such a policy, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 6.10(c)_ for
so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this _Section 6.10_.

 

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third 

 



-77-  party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_, with full rights of enforcement
as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under
this _Section 6.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

(f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this  _Section 6.10_ shall be joint and
several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and
compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as they may have been revised or
consented to as contemplated by _Section 5.1(b)(viii))_, _provided, however_
, that nothing in this sentence or otherwise in this _Section 6.11_ shall
prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to
amend or terminate, any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in
accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(b) During the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide to Continuing Employees while
they continue in employment employee benefits (other than any defined benefit
or cash balance pension plan, deferred compensation, equity-based
benefits, severance benefits, post-termination health, medical, or other
welfare or life insurance benefits and individual employment agreements) that,
taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits (other than any defined benefit or cash balance pension plan,
deferred compensation, equity-based benefits, severance benefits, post-
termination health, medical or other welfare or life insurance benefits and
individual employment agreements) provided to Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Base salary, cash bonus opportunity
or regular wages as of the Effective Time shall not be decreased for a period
of one (1) year following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee
who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate
during that period.

 



-78- (c) To the extent that, following the Effective Time, employee benefits are
provided under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), and
in which such Continuing Employees did not participate prior to the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, cause to
be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and any predecessor employer (to the extent the Company
and its Subsidiaries provide such past service credit) prior to the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, with
respect to vacation, sick time or paid time off, accrual and severance pay
entitlement); _provided, however_ , that such service need not be credited to
the extent that (i) it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits or
(ii) employees who are similarly situated to the Continuing Employees are not
provided with such service credit under such plan. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing; (a) each Continuing Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and
all New Plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan
replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); (b) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to
any Continuing Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, (x) cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent it
would have been waived under the comparable Old Plan, and (y) cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a comparable Old Plan during the portion of the plan year of
the Old Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time
to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to making any broadly distributed written or oral communications to
the Continuing Employees pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that
are affected by either (i) the Merger or (ii) the other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of
the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in providing such mutually agreeable communication.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries to terminate, any Continuing Employee for
any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to continue any Employee Plan, New Plan, or other benefit
plan, agreement or

 



-79-  arrangement, or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time; or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of
or an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated as an
amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan
arrangement. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and benefits that may be provided to any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of the Affiliates or under any benefit plan which any of them may maintain, or
otherwise.

 

6.12 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and
_Section 7.2(b)_ to not be satisfied at the Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any

preceding clauses (i) through (iii) shall expire, with respect to each such
event, ten (10) Business Days after the first date upon which Parent had

all cases to _Section 8.3(b)(iv)_ and _Section 8.3(c)(iv)_, nothing herein
shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from any liability
or damages resulting from any Willful Breach prior to such termination, in
which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at
law or in equity _; provided, however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Acquisition Sub
have any liability for, or be required to pay any damages for, any breach of
this Agreement in excess of the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee, and
_provided, further_ , that in no event shall the Company be entitled to, or
Parent or Acquisition Sub be liable for, payment of both the Reverse

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent $19,168,150 (such amount _plus_ any
Additional Termination Fee payable pursuant to  _Section 6.17(a)_, the

(A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_, _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_ (for
_Section 8.1(d)_, only if terminated as a result of a breach by the Company
of its covenants or obligations, and not representations or warranties)
hereunder such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be
satisfied); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to any such termination of this Agreement, a Competing Acquisition
Transaction shall have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly
disclosed and shall not have been publicly withdrawn; and (C) within twelve
(12) months following any such termination of this Agreement, the Company or
any of its Affiliates either (x) consummates a Competing Acquisition
Transaction or (y) enters into a definitive agreement for a Competing
Acquisition Transaction which is subsequently consummated (whether before or
after such twelve (12) month period), in each case, whether or not the
Competing Acquisition Transaction was the same Competing Acquisition
Transaction referred to in clause (B) of this _Section 8.3(b)_. For purposes
of the foregoing, a "Competing Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same
meaning as an "Acquisition Transaction" except that all references therein to
"more than twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section 8.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee as
a condition to the effectiveness of such termination.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee within
two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
but subject to Parents rights set forth in _Section 9.8_, in any
circumstance in which Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this _Section 8.3(b)_, the receipt of the Termination Fee in such
circumstance shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and Parent Related Parties against the Company or any of its
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for any and all losses and
damages suffered or incurred as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise, including for Willful Breach) or otherwise arising out of, or
directly or indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, and,
upon receipt of the Termination Fee in such circumstance, none of the Company
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any other document, theory of law or equity or oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, in contract,
in tort or otherwise (except that (x) the obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to survive and (y) the Company shall
also be obligated with respect to _Section 8.3(e)_).

 



-93- Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding clause (iv),
following the receipt of the Termination Fee in such circumstance, (A) none
of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party shall be entitled to
bring, maintain or support any Legal Proceedings against the Company or any
Company Related Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination, and (B) Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause any Legal Proceedings pending
in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent maintained
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party against the Company or
any Company Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly.

 

(v) The Company shall make any required payment of the Termination Fee (x) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, or (y) at the option of the Company, if the
Company Escrow Account is then fully funded, by causing the Company Escrow
Agent to deliver to Parent, in accordance with the instructions of Parent
and the terms of the Company Escrow Agreement, the Company Escrow Amount. In
the event such payment is not timely made in full, Parent may send a written
request to the Company Escrow Agent requesting the release of amounts held
pursuant to the Company Escrow Agreement, and the Company shall cooperate
with Parent to effectuate such release. In the event such payment is made in
full other than pursuant to clause (y) of the first sentence of this sub-
section (v), Parent thereafter shall cooperate reasonably with the Company in
effecting the release to the Company of the Company Escrow Amount.

(c) _Parent Payments_. 

(i) Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the sum of the DB

8.1(b)(i)_ and: (A) at the time of such termination, all of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions
that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing provided such
conditions are then capable of being fulfilled) shall have been satisfied or
waived, other than those conditions that are not satisfied as a result of (i)
any failure to obtain any approvals from any Governmental Entity of the PRC
that are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) an Order of any Governmental Entity of the PRC that
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger or
(iii) any failure to obtain the Taiwan Approvals, in each case of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by
the Company; or (B) at the time of or immediately prior to such termination,
the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ as a result of (A) the enactment, issuance
or

 



-94-  promulgation of any Law in the PRC or Taiwan that is in effect and has the
effect of making the Merger illegal or (B) the issuance or grant of an Order
(other than a Taiwan Rejection Notice) of any Governmental Entity of the PRC
or Taiwan that is in effect and has the effect of making the Merger illegal or
which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation
of the Merger under the Laws of the PRC or Taiwan, and such Order has become
final and non-appealable, Parent shall pay to the Company the Reverse
Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after demand by the Company.

Reverse Termination Fee (such fee to be paid in a combination of US Dollars
and RMB proportionate to the amounts of such currencies held in the DB Escrow
Account and the CMB Escrow Account) (the "Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee")
within two (2) Business Days after demand by the Company.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys rights set forth in  _Section 8.3(c)(vii)_ and
_Section 9.8_, in any circumstance in which the Company receives payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee or the Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(c)_, the receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee or the
Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee in such circumstance shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company and all Company Related Parties against
Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Sponsors, the Lender under the Debt Financing or
any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for any
and all losses and damages suffered or incurred as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise, including for Willful Breach) or otherwise
arising out of, or directly or indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the
Financing Agreements, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or
thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and, upon receipt
of the Reverse Termination Fee or the Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee in such
circumstance, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any other document, theory of law or equity or oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, in contract,
in tort or otherwise (except that (x) the obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to survive and (y) Parent shall also
be obligated with respect to _Section 8.3(e)_ and any indemnification or
reimbursement obligations contained in _Section 6.15(a)_ and in the last
sentence of _Section 6.16(a)_.

 

(vi) Except as expressly provided in the immediately preceding clause (vi)
above, following the receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee or the Taiwan
Reverse Termination Fee in such circumstance, (A) none of the Company or any
Company Related Party

 



-95-  shall be entitled to bring, maintain or support any Legal Proceedings
against Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Agreements, the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination, and (B) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any Legal Proceedings pending in connection
with this Agreement, the Financing Agreements, the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, to the extent maintained by the Company or any Company Related
Party against Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Parent Related Party to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly.

 

(vii) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to obtain an injunction,
or other appropriate form of equitable relief, to cause Parent and Acquisition
Sub to cause the Financing, or, in the case of the Equity Financing, for the
Company to directly cause the Equity Financing, to be funded, at any time
if, and only if, and that the Company shall not otherwise be entitled to
obtain any injunction or other form of equitable relief to cause such funding
unless, each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) with respect
to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Closing, all
conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied, and remain
satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the
failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (B) the financing provided for
by the Bank Letter (or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance
with _Section 6.15(d)_, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has
been funded or would be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing, (C) Parent and Acquisition Sub fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section 2.3 (_taking into account any extension of the Termination Date in
accordance with _Section 8.1(b)(i))_, and (D) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, (I) nothing in this  _Section 8.3(c)(vii)_ shall prohibit the Company
from seeking an injunction, specific performance and/or other equitable relief
pursuant to _Section 9.8_ prior to the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and  _Section 7.2_ being satisfied or waived (other than with
respect to the Companys right to obtain an injunction, specific performance
or other appropriate form of equitable relief, to cause Parent and Acquisition
Sub to cause, or for the Company to directly cause, either or both of the
Equity Financing and/or the Debt Financing to be funded at any time, which
shall be subject to this _Section 8.3(c)(vii)_), and (II) while the Company
may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type provided in the
preceding sentence and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or the
Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, under _Section 8.3(c)_, under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the preceding
sentence and monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Reverse
Termination Fee or the Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee.

 

(viii) Parent shall make any required payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
or Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, (x) by wire transfer of

 



-96-  immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by the Company or, (y) at the option of Parent, by causing the DB Escrow Agent
and the CMB Escrow Agent to deliver, in accordance with the instructions of
the Company and the terms of the DB Escrow Agreement and the CMB Escrow
Agreement, to the Company the DB Escrow Amount and the CMB Escrow Amount (or,
in the case of the Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee, one half of the DB Escrow
Amount and one half of the CMB Escrow Amount). In the event such payment is
not timely made in full, the Company (or, with respect to the DB Escrow
Amount, the Company Subsidiary that is party to the DB Escrow Agreement) may
send a written request to the DB Escrow Agent and the CMB Escrow Agent
requesting the release of amounts held pursuant to the DB Escrow Agreement and
the CMB Escrow Agreement (or, in the case of the Taiwan Reverse Termination
Fee, one half of each such amount), and Parent shall not object to (and, with
respect to the CMB Escrow Amount, shall cause Summitview Affiliate not to
object to) any such release. The Company shall not otherwise request (or allow
the Company Subsidiary that is a party to the DB Escrow Agreement to request)
release of the amounts held in the DB Escrow Agreement and the CMB Escrow
Agreement. In the event such payment is made in full other than pursuant to
clause (y) of the first sentence of this sub-section (vii), the Company
thereafter shall cooperate (and cause such Company Subsidiary that is a party
to the DB Escrow Agreement to cooperate) reasonably with Parent in effecting
the release to Parent of the DB Escrow Amount and the release to Summitview
Affiliate of the CMB Escrow Amount.

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination
Fee, or Parent be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee or the Taiwan
Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion (or, in the
case of Parent, under any circumstances to pay both the Reverse Termination
Fee and the Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee), whether or not such termination
fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same
or at different times and the occurrence of different events.

(e) _Liquidated Damages_. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) each of the Termination Fee the Reverse Termination Fee and the
Taiwan Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Company,
respectively, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iii) without
these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company or Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the payment of any amount set forth
in this _Section 8.3_, the non-paying shall pay the other party its costs and
expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser
rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

-99- 9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, made as of February 4, 2015 (as amended, the

accordance with its terms. 

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Annexes hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof; _provided, however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement
shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the

in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties
thereto.

economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



-100- 9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(c)_, and except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred

remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that, subject in
all events to the limits of _Section 8.3(c)(vii)_, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and/or
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants
or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. Subject in all events to the
limits of _Section 8.3(c)(vii)_, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party
(or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or
parties) under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or the Financing and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Financing
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such order or injunction.

 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

9.10 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Escrow Agreement or its or their
subject matter (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity,
formation, effect, interpretation, performance or termination of this
Agreement) (each, a "Dispute") shall be finally settled by arbitration. The
place of arbitration shall be Hong Kong, and the arbitration shall be
administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (the "Centre")

Parent and the Company shall be entitled to nominate one (1) arbitrator. The
third
