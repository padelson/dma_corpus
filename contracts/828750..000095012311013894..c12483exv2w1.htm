shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time;

(B) a number of shares of Buyer Stock equal to the quotient obtained by

of the Effective Time. 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Party or the holder of any of the following securities, (i)
each of the Company Shares held in the Companys treasury immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration in respect thereof, (ii) all Company Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such share of Common Stock
or Series A Preferred Stock (" _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any

of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.4 upon the surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with this Agreement, without interest and
(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub

no transfer of Company Shares shall thereafter be made. Following the Merger,
the holders of Certificates formerly representing Company Shares shall look

2.6 _Options_. 

  

(a) At and after the Closing, each holder of a Vested Common Option shall be
automatically entitled to receive, in cancellation and settlement for each
share of Common Stock underlying a Vested Common Option, without interest and
subject to applicable withholdings, an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Per
Share Merger Consideration _minus_ (y) the Option Exercise Price with
respect to such Vested Common Option, payable in cash (with respect to such
Vested Common Option, the " _Net Per Vested Common Option Payment_ "). After
the Effective Time, each holder of a Vested Common Option shall only be
entitled to the payment (if any) described in the preceding sentence and all
such Vested Common Options shall be cancelled pursuant to the terms of the
Company Stock Plan. 

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Unvested Common Option shall,
as part of the Merger, be assumed by Buyer in accordance with the terms (as
in effect as of the date hereof) of such Company Stock Plan under which such
Common Option was issued and the stock option agreement by which such Common
Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Common Stock under
outstanding Common Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Buyer Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (i)
each Unvested Common Option assumed by Buyer may be exercised solely for
shares of Buyer Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Buyer Stock subject
to each such assumed Common Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock that were subject to such Common Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Buyer Stock, (iii) the per share exercise price for
the Buyer Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Common Option
shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Common Stock
subject to such Common Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent, (iv) all restrictions on the exercise
of each such assumed Common Option shall continue in full force and effect,
and (v) the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of
such Common Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; _provided however_ ,
that each such assumed Common Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
transaction effected by Buyer after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the assumption and conversion of Common Options under this Section
2.6(b) shall be implemented in accordance with Code Section 424(a) so as not
to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the Common Option
within the meaning of Code Section 424(h). The Company and Buyer shall take
all action that may be necessary (under the Company Stock Plan and otherwise)
to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.6(b). Buyer has reserved and
shall continue to reserve adequate shares of Buyer Stock for delivery upon
exercise of any assumed Common Option. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, if it has not already done so, and to the extent Buyer shall
have a registration statement in effect or an obligation to file a
registration statement on Form S-3 or S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), Buyer shall include in such
registration statement all shares of Buyer Stock subject to the assumed
Common Options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement (and to maintain the current
status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as such assumed
Common Options remain outstanding. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Buyer shall deliver to the participants holding assumed Common Options
reasonable notice of the foregoing events.

the Escrow Shares issued in the name of each respective Stockholder
and reflecting the allocations of such Buyer Shares as set forth in _Schedule
2.7_. All releases of Escrow Shares and Escrow Funds to Buyer pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement shall be made in the same ratio as the Stock Consideration
bears to the Cash Consideration, respectively, and all releases of Escrow
Shares and Escrow Funds to the Stockholders shall be made in accordance with
the allocations set forth on _Schedule 2.7_.For purposes of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, each share of Buyer Stock included in the Escrow
Shares shall be deemed at all times to have a value equal to the Buyer Stock
Value. 

  

(d) Buyer shall remit the Escrow Funds to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to such account designated by the Escrow Agent
in a written notice to Buyer prior to the Closing Date.

entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from
amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such

payments under any provision of federal state, local or foreign Tax Law.
Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. 

   

2.9 _Second Merger_. 

  

(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, Buyer will cause the Surviving
Corporation to merge with and into Merger Sub II (the " _Second Merger_ " and
together with the Merger, the " _Mergers_ ") and the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease and Merger Sub
II shall be the surviving entity (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") in the Second
Merger. 

  

(b) At the effective time of the Second Merger, the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation shall automatically be converted into a membership
interest in the Surviving Entity representing 100% of the ownership interests
in the Surviving Entity. 

  

(c) With respect to any time following the Second Merger, references herein to
the Surviving Corporation shall refer to the Surviving Entity.

5.4 _Investment Representations_. 

  

(a) Such Stockholder has such knowledge and experience in financial and

investment in the Buyer Stock. Such Stockholder has the financial ability to
bear the economic risk of his or her investment in the Buyer Stock
being acquired hereunder, has adequate means for providing for his or her
current needs and contingencies and has no need for liquidity with respect to
his or her investment in Buyer. 

  

(b) Such Stockholder is acquiring the shares of Buyer Stock hereunder for
investment for his or her own account, for investment purposes only, and not
with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof;
provided, however, that, except for any contractual restrictions on resale of
the shares of Buyer Stock acquired hereunder to which such Stockholder has
agreed in the Registration Agreement, such Stockholder does not by making the
representations herein agree to hold the Buyer Stock for any minimum or other
specific term and reserves the right to dispose of the Buyer Stock at any
time in accordance with or pursuant to the Registration Agreement, a
registration statement or an exemption under the Securities Act. Such

the holding period and the amount of securities to be sold and the manner of
sale. Such Stockholder understands that only Buyer can take action to
register the shares of Buyer Stock.

(d) Such Stockholder has relied upon independent investigations made by such
Stockholder or his or her representatives and is substantially familiar with

affairs of Buyer and realizes the shares of Buyer Stock are a speculative
investment involving a high degree of risk for which there is no assurance of
any return. Such Stockholder has, among other things, received and had the

matter in relation to Buyers business or affairs, other than as expressly

discuss Buyers business, management, financial affairs and acquisition plans
with its management, to review Buyers facilities, and to obtain such
additional information concerning such Stockholders investment in the shares
of Buyer Stock in order for such Stockholder to evaluate its merits and
risks, and such Stockholder has determined that the shares of Buyer Stock are
a suitable investment for such Stockholder and that at this time such
Stockholder could bear a complete loss of his or her investment. 

  

(e) Such Stockholder is aware that no federal or state or other agency has
passed upon or made any finding or determination concerning the fairness of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the adequacy of the
disclosure of the exhibits and schedules hereto and such Stockholder must
forego the security, if any, that such a review would provide. 

  

(f) Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that neither the Internal
Revenue Service nor any other Tax authority has been asked to rule on the Tax

advisors in addition to such Stockholders own independent investigations,

considered all the Tax consequences of such Stockholders acquisition of the
shares of Buyer Stock hereunder. Except as expressly set forth herein,
the Stockholders will be responsible for the full amount of any federal or
state and any other Tax liability for which they may be responsible under
applicable Tax Law resulting from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will have no recourse against Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates for any such Tax liability or
for the tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Stock issued to such Stockholder hereunder shall bear a legend in
substantially the following form: 

   

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, OR QUALIFIED UNDER ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY

SUCH DISPOSITION WILL NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION OF SUCH SECURITIES UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

7.4 _Fulfillment of Closing Conditions; Consents; Further Assurances_. At and
prior to the Closing, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
fulfill, and to cause each other to fulfill, as soon as practicable the
conditions specified in Article IX to the extent that the fulfillment of such
conditions is within its or his control. In connection with the
foregoing, each Party will (i) refrain from any actions that would cause any
of its representations and warranties to be inaccurate as of the Closing, and
take any reasonable actions within its control that would be necessary to
prevent its representations and warranties from being inaccurate as of the
Closing, (ii) execute and deliver the applicable agreements and other
documents referred to in Article IX, (iii) comply with all applicable Laws in
connection with its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals required under any Laws, Contracts or otherwise, including any
Required Consents (v) use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all other actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

  

7.5 _Financial Statements_. During the Interim Period, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP (as its independent
accountants) to (i) prepare in the ordinary course the audit of the (A)
consolidated balance sheet for the Company at February 28, 2011 and (B)
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash
flows of the Company for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2011 and (ii)
deliver prior to April 15, 2011 an unqualified opinion with respect to such
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows (the " _2011 Audited
Financial Statements_ "). The Parties acknowledge that for purposes of this
Agreement, the costs associated with preparing the 2011 Audited Financial
Statements (the " _Financial Statement Audit Costs_ ") shall be borne by the
Company and not the Stockholders and, accordingly, upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, such Financial Statement Audit Costs
shall not constitute Transaction Costs hereunder. 

   

7.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. 

  

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Entity (or any successor) to indemnify each Person who is or was a
director or officer of the Company at or prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Directors and Officers_ ") for any claim or action that
may be instituted or asserted by any Person (" _Covered Claims_ ") as and to
the fullest extent permitted by the indemnification provisions of the
Companys Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof
(notwithstanding whether such provisions are mandatory or permissive) and the
DGCL (including, without limitation, Section 102(b)(7) and Section 145 as
in effect as of the date hereof); provided, however, that, in the event any
claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue
until the disposition of any and all such claims. The Surviving Entitys
Organizational Documents will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification for Covered Claims that are at least as favorable to
the indemnified parties thereunder as those contained in this Section 7.6 and
the Companys Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Closing Date in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights of individuals who, at any time prior to the Closing Date,
were indemnified parties thereunder, except as required by applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Entity (or any successor) to maintain directors and officers
liability insurance policies with respect to Covered Claims (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby);
provided, however, that Buyer shall only be required to provide coverage
amounts that can be purchased with the payment of premiums in amounts of not
more than 300% of the premiums paid by the Company for such coverage as of
the date of this Agreement. 

  

(c) This Section 7.6 shall be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Companys current or former Directors and Officers, and their respective
heirs, executor, administrators and estates.

(a) _Benefits_ Effective as of October 1, 2011 or as soon as
administratively practicable following October 1, 2011, Buyer shall cause
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by
the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date to be
eligible to participate in the GSI Commerce, Inc. Group Health and
Welfare Plan (the " _Buyer Health Plan_ "). From the Closing until employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Buyer
Health Plan, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Entity to continue to provide
group health coverage to such employees so that they have no gap in coverage.
As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue to be
employed by the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries on and after the
Closing Date to be eligible to participate in the GSI Commerce, Inc. 401(k)
Plan. Buyer further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to,
grant all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue to be
employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date
credit for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries earned prior to
the Closing Date measured from the most recent date of hire or such earlier
date as required by applicable Law (x) for eligibility and vesting purposes
and (y) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations
(to the extent years of service is relevant to the level of benefits for
which an employee is eligible), under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that may be established or maintained by
the Buyer or the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the
Closing Date (the " _Buyer Plans_ "); provided, however, that in no event
shall such service credit result in any duplication of benefits. In addition,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived all
pre existing condition exclusions (and shall waive them to the extent
required by applicable Laws) and actively at work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under the Buyer Health Plan to the extent waived or satisfied by
an employee under any Company Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
provide credit for deductibles, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by any employee under any Company Benefit Plan for the plan year
that includes the Closing Date.

(b) _Employee Communications_. No officer, director, employee, agent or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall make any
communication to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
regarding any compensation or benefits to be provided after the Closing Date
without the advance written approval of Buyer. 

  

(c) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as specifically contemplated by
Section 7.6(c) herein, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that
nothing in this Agreement (i) is intended to create a contract between Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation, the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or
the Companys ERISA Affiliates on the one hand and any employee of
the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or the Companys ERISA
Affiliates, on the other hand, and no employee of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or the Companys ERISA
Affiliates may rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of
contract claim against Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, or the Companys ERISA Affiliates; and (ii) shall
be deemed or construed to limit Buyers or the Surviving Corporations right
to terminate the employment of any employee of the Surviving Corporation or
any of the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries after the Closing. 

  

(d) _Company Benefit Plans_. The Company shall adopt a resolution terminating
the Minnesota Life 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No later than three Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that resolution
has been adopted and shall also take all such other actions in furtherance of
terminating the 401(k) Plan as Buyer may reasonably require. In the event
that termination of the 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other extraordinary fees,
then the Company shall take commercially reasonable measures to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges or fees and provide such estimate
in writing to Buyer no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. 

  

7.8 _Stockholder Approval_. Each Stockholder hereby waives any appraisal
rights to which it may become entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL in
respect of the Merger. The Stockholders and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, the Requisite Stockholder
Approval for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pursuant to a
written consent of the holders of Company Shares in accordance with
the applicable requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The
Company shall send, pursuant to Sections 228 and 262(d) of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, a written notice to all holders of Company Shares
that did not execute such written consent informing them that this Agreement
and the Merger were adopted and approved by the holders of Company Shares and
that appraisal rights are available for their Company Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (which notice shall
include a copy of such Section 262), and shall promptly inform Buyer of
the date on which such notice was sent. 

  

7.9 _Exclusivity_. During the Interim Period, except with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the
Stockholders agree that they will not, and they will cause the Companys
Subsidiaries and the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates and other agents and representatives
(including any investment banking, lending, financing, legal or accounting
firm retained by it or any of them and any individual member or employee of
the foregoing) (each, an " _Agent_ ") not to: (a) initiate, encourage,
solicit or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making
or implementation of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer
to its stockholders or any of them) with respect to a merger, acquisition,
consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, equity investment
or similar transaction involving, or any purchase

substantive discussions with, any person relating to a Proposal; (c)
otherwise facilitate or cooperate in any effort or attempt to make, implement

a Proposal. If the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Agent has provided

with any confidential information or data relating to a Proposal, they shall
request the immediate return thereof. The Company shall notify
Buyer immediately if any inquiries, proposals or offers related to a Proposal
are received by, any confidential information or data is requested from, or
any negotiations or discussions related to a Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees and Affiliates or, to its
Knowledge, any other Agent. Such notice shall disclose the identity of the
party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Proposal, inquiry or
request, and shall include a true and complete copy of such Proposal, inquiry
or request, if in writing. 

   

7.10 _Restrictive Covenants_. 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, each Stockholder and Non-Compete Party shall
keep confidential any confidential information of the Company (and its
Subsidiaries), including any information constituting or relating to trade
secrets of the Company (and its Subsidiaries) or confidential Intellectual
Property of the Company (and its Subsidiaries), or any confidential
information of Buyer, Merger Subs or any of their respective Affiliates
acquired in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to
the extent that such information (a) is in the public domain through no fault
of such Stockholder or Non-Compete Party, or (b) was lawfully acquired after
the Closing from sources, other than Buyer, Merger Subs or any of their
respective Affiliates, which are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation of such
Stockholder or Non-Compete Party. If any Stockholder or Non-Compete Party is
compelled to disclose any such information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of law, such Stockholder or Non-Compete
Party shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that
portion of such information that such Stockholder or Non-Compete Party
reasonably believes after consultation with counsel, is legally required to
be disclosed; provided, however, that each such Stockholder or Non-Compete
Party shall exercise reasonable best efforts at Buyers expense to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information. 

  

(b) During the period beginning immediately after the Closing and ending on
the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "),
each Non-Compete Party covenants and agrees not to, directly or indirectly,
any where in the world, own, manage, operate, control, consult for, advise,
finance or participate in the ownership, management, operation, control,
consultation for, advising, or financing of, or permit its name to be used by
or in connection with, any Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in any
activity or business that generates a significant portion of its revenues
from the sale of licensed team sports merchandise and accessories across
major collegiate and professional team sports; provided, however, that
the ownership by a Non-Compete Party and its Affiliates, collectively, of an
aggregate of 3% or less of the outstanding stock of any publicly-traded
company shall not violate the provisions of this Section 7.10(b) so long as
no such Non-Compete Party is an officer, director or controlling person with
respect to such publicly-traded company. 

  

(c) During the Non-Compete Period, no Non-Compete Party shall, directly or
indirectly, call-on, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any
customer or supplier of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries existing on or after
the date hereof (including the Surviving Corporation) to discontinue or
reduce or modify the extent of such relationship with Buyer or any of such
Subsidiaries.

(e) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by any Stockholder or Non-
Compete Party of any of the provisions contained in Sections 7.10(a), (b),
(c) or (d), as applicable, Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief, restraining such party from using or disclosing any
confidential information in whole or in part, or from engaging in conduct that
would constitute a breach of the obligations contained in such Sections. Such
relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies that may
be available, including an action for the recovery of damages. 

  

7.11 _Resignations_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be
delivered to Buyer duly signed resignations, effective immediately upon the
Closing, of all directors of their position as a director and all officers of
their position as an officer of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company for which Buyer has requested in writing at least five (5) Business
Days prior to Closing; _provided_ _that_ no such resignation by any
individual shall be a resignation from employment with the Company or such
Subsidiary if such individual is so employed. 

  

7.12 _Required Consents_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Consents set forth as items 1-10 on _Schedule 4.5_
prior to the Closing Date;  _provided_ that, in no event shall the failure to
obtain such Consents prior to the Closing Date constitute a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, result in the failure of any
condition to Closing set forth herein (or otherwise provide the Buyer with any
right of termination hereunder) or be the subject of any indemnification
claim pursuant to Section 11.2(a), except to the extent the Company fails to

TAX MATTERS 

   

8.1 _Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared (in a manner consistent with prior
practice) and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns for the
Group Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which
are filed after the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit the
Stockholders Representatives to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior
to filing. Buyer shall deduct from the Escrow Funds, no later than two (2)
Business Days before the due date (giving effect to any validly obtained
extension thereof) for such Tax Return, the amount of any Pre-Closing
Taxes payable by a Group Company with respect to such Tax Return to the
extent such amounts were not accrued for on the Balance Sheet. Buyer shall
not file an amended return with respect to any previously filed Tax Return,
except as required by Law.

8.2 _Tax Returns for Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date_. 

  

(a) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared (in a manner consistent with
prior practices to the extent compliant with applicable Law) and timely file
or cause to be timely filed any Tax Returns of a Group Company for Tax
periods that begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a
" _Straddle Period_ "). Buyer shall deduct from the Escrow Funds, no
later than two (2) business days before the due date (giving effect to any
validly obtained extension thereof) for such Tax Return, any amount allocable
to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Balance Sheet Date
pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 8.2 with respect to such
taxable periods covered by such Tax Return to the extent that such amounts
were not accrued for on the Balance Sheet. Buyer shall permit the
Stockholders Representatives to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior
to filing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will claim all
deductible Transaction Costs on the Companys final Tax Return and will not
apply the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76 to claim
such deductions on the Buyers consolidated tax return. 

  

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Balance Sheet Date for all
purposes of this Agreement (including the calculation of Pre-Closing Taxes)
shall be deemed to be: 

  

(i) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or,
in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Balance Sheet Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period; and 

  

(ii) In the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as franchise Taxes,
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon
occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)),
the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period
ended as of the close of business on the Balance Sheet Date. 

  

8.3 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. (i) Buyer, each Group Company and the
Stockholders Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the provision of adequate notice regarding
any tax proceeding and the retention and (upon another partys request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each Group Company and
the Stockholders Representative agree (A) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, to allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records. The Stockholders Representative shall
have the right, at its owns expense, to control the conduct and settlement
of, and represent the Companys interest in, any Tax proceeding relating to
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel
of its choice, but reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, for such purpose.
Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Tax proceeding at its own
expense, and shall be entitled to control the disposition of any issue
involved in such Tax proceeding that does not relate to or affect an
indemnified Tax. The Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall be entitled
to represent their own interests in light of their responsibilities (including
indemnity obligations) for Taxes, at their own expense, in any Tax
proceeding involving a taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.3,
neither the Stockholders Representative nor Buyer shall agree to any
settlement on behalf of the Company with respect to any Tax proceeding
without the consent of the other if such settlement could reasonably be
expected to affect, respectively, any Tax liability of an Indemnitee that is
not an indemnified Tax, or any amount of an indemnified Tax. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 8.3, the provisions of Article XI shall
govern the manner in which Tax proceedings are conducted.

8.4 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid 50% by the
Buyer and 50% by the Stockholders. Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer (including real
property transfer and stock transfer), documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees, provided that the Stockholders shall
cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and making timely filings of such Tax
Returns and will execute such Tax Returns as required by applicable Law. 

  

8.5 _Tax Refunds_. The Stockholders shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes
(including any interest paid thereon) of a Group Company for any Tax period
ending on or before the Balance Sheet Date and for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Balance Sheet Date, treating the pre-Closing
portion of any such Straddle Period as a separate Tax period, but only to
the extent such Tax refund was not reflected as an asset of the Company on
the Balance Sheet, or was received in connection with a refund request filed
prior to the end of the Survival Period, or was received in connection with a
Tax proceeding commenced before the end of the Survival Period. 

  

8.6 _Tax-Free Reorganization_. Buyer, Merger Subs and the Company shall not
take, and shall not permit any of the Subsidiaries (including, in the case of
Buyer, the Merger Subs), Affiliates, representatives or any "related person"
(within the meaning of such term as used in Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1) to take, any action that would prevent the Mergers, taken together
in the manner described in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, from qualifying as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code. Merger Sub II will
not, in connection with the transactions provided for herein, elect to be
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be merged with
or into any entity that is treated as other than an entity whose
separate existence from Buyer is disregarded for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, transfer any portion of its assets to an entity that is treated as
a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or take any action that
would cause it not to be treated as an entity whose separate existence
from Buyer is disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Buyer will
not, in connection with the transactions provided for herein, take any action
which would cause Merger Sub II not to be treated as an entity whose separate
existence from Buyer is disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
parties hereto intend that the Mergers, taken together in the manner described
in Revenue Ruling 2001-46, shall qualify as a reorganization described in
Section 368(a) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
acknowledge that, in determining whether the payment of Merger Consideration
and other relevant amounts pursuant to this Agreement satisfy the continuity
of interest requirement of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the
"signing date rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1T(e)(2) (as
utilized by Prop Reg. Section 1.368-1 pursuant to Notice 2010-25) shall be
applicable to the valuation of the Stock Consideration. The Parties hereto
shall prepare all books, records, and filings in a manner consistent with
this Section 8.6.

opinion, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Mergers, taken

Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall
be entitled to receive and rely upon representations, warranties and
covenants of officers of Buyer, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the Company or
others reasonably requested by such counsel. For the avoidance of doubt, such
opinion shall acknowledge that, in determining whether the payment of
the Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to this
Agreement satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the "signing date rule" of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1T(e)(2) (as utilized by Prop Reg. Section 1.368-1 pursuant

Consideration. Furthermore, for the purpose of determining whether the
payment of the Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to
this Agreement satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the opinion shall assume that at
least forty percent (40%) of such amounts must be payable in Buyer Stock (as
compared to cash or other consideration) in order for the Mergers to be
treated as an integrated "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. In the event that Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP is unwilling to
provide such opinion, Buyer shall accept such opinion from Paul, Hastings,
Janofsky and Walker LLP, if such firm will provide the same to Buyer.

appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and who have not validly
waived such appraisal rights pursuant to Section 7.8 or otherwise, the period
to demand appraisal rights thereunder shall have expired, and no holder of
Company Shares shall have demanded or purported to demand appraisal rights
(and not withdrawn such demand) in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. 

  

(j) The Company shall have delivered, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, (i) payoff letters from each lender with respect to all
Material Indebtedness outstanding at the Effective Time and (ii) letters
evidencing the termination of the FT-WD Letter of Credit and the BOA
Revolving Loan, which, in each case, provide for satisfaction in full of all
Material Indebtedness outstanding thereunder, termination of such credit
facilities or other underlying agreements and the full and final release of
any and all Liens relating thereto on the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries following receipt of the amount set forth in such payoff
letters or upon the consummation of the Merger, as applicable. 

  

(k) The Company shall have delivered, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, a duly executed termination agreement terminating that
certain consulting agreement with Insight Venture Management, LLC, effective

Closing Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties
refer specifically to an earlier date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date, in each
case except where the failure to be true and correct (without giving effect
to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" set
forth therein) would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(b) Buyer and Merger Subs shall have performed or complied in all material
respects with all obligations and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with at or prior to the Closing Date. 

  

(c) The Company shall have received certificates signed on behalf of each of

the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion,
such counsel shall be entitled to receive and rely upon representations,
warranties and covenants of officers of Buyer, Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the
Company or others reasonably requested by such counsel. For the avoidance of
doubt, such opinion shall acknowledge that, in determining whether the
payment of the Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to
this Agreement satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the "signing date rule" of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1T(e)(2) (as utilized by Prop Reg. Section 1.368-1 pursuant to
Notice 2010-25) shall be applicable to the valuation of the
Stock Consideration. Furthermore, for the purpose of determining whether the
payment of the Merger Consideration and other relevant amounts pursuant to
this Agreement satisfy the continuity of interest requirement of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.368-1(e), the opinion shall assume that at least forty
percent (40%) of such amounts must be payable in Buyer Stock (as compared to
cash or other consideration) in order for the Mergers to be treated as an
integrated "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
In the event that Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker LLP is unwilling to
provide such opinion, the Company shall accept such opinion from
Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, if such firm will provide the same to the
Company. 

  

(e) There shall not have occurred a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and no
event shall have occurred or circumstance exist that, in combination with any
other events or circumstances, could reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(f) The Buyer shall have delivered a letter of credit in substitute for the
FT-WD Letter of Credit or made other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to satisfy the obligations of the Company pursuant to the
Commonwealth Lease from and after the Effective Time.

11.4 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_. 

  

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or state of
facts which could give rise to any claim or demand, for which an Indemnitor
may be liable to an Indemnitee hereunder is asserted or sought to be
collected by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnitee shall as
soon as practicable notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third Party
Claim (" _Notice of Claim_ "). The Notice of Claim shall (i) specify in
reasonable detail the basis for such claim and (ii) to the extent known by
the Indemnitee, set forth a reasonable estimate of the amount to which such
Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with
the Notice of Claim a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third
Party Claim, if any, and any other documents evidencing such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay or deficiency on the part of
an Indemnitee in so notifying the Indemnitor will limit any Indemnitees
right to indemnification under this Article XI (except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the defense of such proceeding). 

  

(b) The Indemnitor will have fifteen (15) days from the date on which the
Indemnitor received the Notice of Claim to notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and
at its sole cost and expense (a " _Third Party Defense_ "). If the
Indemnitor assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance herewith, (i) the
Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim but the Indemnitor shall
control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, (ii) the
Indemnitee will not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor and (iii) the Indemnitor will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, unless such settlement is solely for money damages for which
indemnification in full is provided hereunder and is conditioned on a full
and final release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect to
such Third Party Claim. The Parties will act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The
Parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give each other
reasonable access to all information relevant thereto to the extent permitted
by applicable Law or applicable contractual restrictions, subject to entering
into appropriate confidentiality agreements. 

  

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of the Notice of Claim, the Indemnitee will be entitled
to assume the Third Party Defense (and, if the Indemnitee incurs a Loss with
respect to the matter in question for which the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2 or 11.3, as applicable, at
the expense of the Indemnitor) upon delivery of notice to such effect to the
Indemnitor;  _provided_ _that_ the Indemnitor shall have the right to
participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense, but the
Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof. 

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may any Indemnitor assume,
maintain control of, or participate in, the defense of any proceeding (i)
involving Losses in excess of [**], (ii) involving criminal liability on the
part of any Indemnitee, or (iii) in which any relief other than monetary
damages is sought against an Indemnitee.

11.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will notify the Indemnitor in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter
with respect to which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement that does not involve a Third Party Claim. The Notice of Claim
shall (a) specify in reasonable detail the basis for such claim and (b) to
the extent known by the Indemnitee, a reasonable estimate of the amount to
which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. In the event that the
Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee that it disputes such claim within
thirty (30) days from receipt of such Notice of Claim, the Indemnitor will
have the right within five (5) Business Days to recover indemnification from
the Escrow Shares and Escrow Funds as and to the extent provided herein and
in the Escrow Agreement. If the Indemnitor disagrees in good faith with the
basis for or amount of the Notice of Claim, the Indemnitor shall give written
notice to the Indemnitee of such disagreement (which notice shall contain a
reasonably detailed summary of the basis for such disagreement) and, in that
case, the Indemnitee shall have the right within five (5) Business Days to
recover indemnification for any undisputed amount as and to the extent
provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement. 

  

11.6 _Consequential Damages_. Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any Stockholder, nor any of their Affiliates shall, in any event, be liable
or otherwise responsible to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for any
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or relating to a
breach of any tax representation or warranty set forth in [**] of this
Agreement. 

  

11.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification
payment made by the Stockholders hereunder as a downward cash adjustment to
the Merger Consideration and any indemnification payment made by the Buyer
hereunder as an upward adjustment to the Merger Consideration paid 60% in
cash and 40% in Buyer Stock.

Representative deems necessary or appropriate;

present; and 

   

(vii) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement. 

  

(b) The appointment of the Stockholders Representative shall be deemed
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and Buyer, Merger Subs and
any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon
any action of the Stockholders Representative in all matters referred to
herein. Any action taken by the Stockholders Representative must be
in writing and must be signed by the Stockholders Representative. All
notices required to be made or delivered by Buyer or Merger Subs to the
Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the Stockholders described above
shall be made to the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of
such Stockholder and shall discharge in full all notice requirements of
Buyer, any Buyer Indemnitee or Merger Subs, as applicable, to such
Stockholder with respect thereto. By their appointment of the Stockholders
Representative, the Stockholders hereby confirm all that the
Stockholders Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of his
appointment as the representatives of the Stockholders hereunder. The
Stockholders Representative shall act for the Stockholders on all of the
matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Stockholders
Representative reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the
Stockholders and consistent with the obligations of the Stockholders under
this Agreement, but none of the Stockholders Representative, Buyer, Merger
Subs, the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
responsible to any Stockholder for any damages which the Stockholders may
suffer by the performance of the Stockholders Representatives duties under
this Agreement, except that the Stockholders Representative shall be solely
responsible for all damages arising from willful violation of applicable Law
by it or gross negligence in the performance of his duties under this
Agreement. The Stockholders Representative shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
duties or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise
exist against the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders hereby agree
(a) to reimburse the Stockholders Representative for all out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including fees for any attorneys or other
representative he may employ, and (b) to severally (without, for the
avoidance of doubt, any right of contribution from any of the Surviving
Corporation or the Buyer Indemnitees) indemnify and hold harmless and defend
the Stockholders Representative, his agents and assigns against all
liabilities, claims, actions, damages, losses and expenses (including legal
and other professional fees and expenses, and litigation costs) of any kind
(whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent) arising out of or
in connection with (x) the Stockholders Representatives omissions to act,
or actions taken, resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection
with, or otherwise with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
or (y) actions taken with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
or reasonably believed to be in the scope of the Stockholders
Representatives authority, provided that he or his agent or assign has not
acted with intentional misconduct or fraud in taking such action.

fully protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by the
Company, any Stockholder, Buyer, Merger Subs, or any other evidence deemed by
the Stockholders Representative to be reliable, and the Stockholders
Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by
it. 

  

(d) In the event that the Stockholders Representative dies, becomes legally
incapacitated or resigns (by providing Buyer and the Escrow Agent a minimum
of 60 day advance written notice) from its position as Stockholders
Representative, a successor Stockholders Representative (who shall either be
a Stockholder or another Person reasonably acceptable to Buyer) shall be
appointed in writing by a majority in interest of the Stockholders, such
appointment to become effective upon the delivery of executed counterparts of
such writing to Buyer and the Escrow Agent, together with an acknowledgement
signed by the successor Stockholders Representative named in such writing
that he, she or it accepts the responsibility of successor Stockholders
Representative and agrees to perform and be bound by all provisions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement applicable to the Stockholders
Representative. Failing such appointment, the Escrow Agent or any Stockholder
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Stockholders Representative.
