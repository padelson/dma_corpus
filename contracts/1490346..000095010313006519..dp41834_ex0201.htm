Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, and no
payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(iv)_, will
be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof until the holder
of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 3.2_.

(g) Other than with respect to any Principal Stockholder that is party to a
Support Agreement and that will receive assets having more than $5,000,000 of
value in consideration at the Closing as evidenced by the Spreadsheet (it
being understood that shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the
Deemed Value for such purposes), Parent shall be entitled to (i) take such
steps necessary to verify that each Stockholder and, to the extent required

 



26  under Rule 501, any Beneficial Owner of such Stockholder, that is to receive
any Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an Accredited Investor
and (ii) each such Stockholder shall deliver to Parent or, if requested by
Parent, another third party verifying Person (the " _Verifying Person_ ")
reasonably acceptable to Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the Closing Date, such
information as may be reasonably requested by Parent or such Verifying Person
to verify that each Stockholder and Beneficial Owner of such Stockholder that
is to receive any Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an
Accredited Investor and specifying the relevant provision of Rule 501 pursuant
to which such Accredited Investor status is to be verified. Each Stockholder
and Beneficial Owner who will receive Parent Common Stock at this Closing
shall provide Parent with contact information, including an email address, no
later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the Closing Date. Nothing contained
herein shall require Parent to issue shares of Parent Common Stock to any
Person that Parent knows is not an Accredited Investor.

(h) The certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued and delivered hereunder shall bear the following legend:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF
ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN
THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER
SUCH ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER
JURISDICTION OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND SUCH
LAWS. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER OTHERWISE
COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION."

 

In the event that any such shares of Parent Common Stock cease to be
Restricted Shares, Parent shall, upon the written request of the
Holder thereof, issue to such Holder a new certificate representing such
shares of Parent Common Stock without the legend required by the foregoing.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement,
during the time that any such shares of Parent Common Stock are Restricted
Shares, a holder of such shares shall not transfer (including through a
distribution in kind to any limited partners of such holder or otherwise to
any Beneficial Owner) such shares of Parent Common Stock without first
delivering to Parent a written opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, delivered by a nationally recognized
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that such transfer is being
effected in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act
and otherwise complies with any applicable securities Laws of any state or
other jurisdiction. Any transferee of a holder of Parent Common Stock acquired
hereby shall take such Parent Common Stock subject to the restrictions set
forth herein.

 



27 (j) _Surrender Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Upon the later of the Effective Time and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions (the " _Required
Documentation_ "), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay in
exchange therefor at the later of the Effective Time or by the close
of business one Business Day after delivery by the holder of the Required
Documentation, the Merger Consideration such Certificate is converted into
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 3_ , and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
holder of a Certificate provides the Exchange Agent the Required Documentation
no later than the close of business on the date one Business Day prior to the
Closing, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay in exchange for such
Certificate the Merger Consideration such Certificate is converted into
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 3_ at the Effective Time. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate
amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent) and the Person requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to
be paid, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Except with respect to Dissenting Shares, until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Capital Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(k) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Stockholders Representative or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article 3_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

(l) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article 3_ , and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of

 



28  Company Capital Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment
shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant
to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as directed by Parent.

 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) _No Assumption_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall assume the Company
Options or any other direct or indirect right to acquire Company Common
Stock.

(b) _Company Options_. As soon as practicable following the Execution Date,
the Company Board (or any committee thereof administering the Company Benefit
Plans), shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to ensure that, at the Effective Time, each Company Option (whether
vested or unvested and whether exercisable or not exercisable) that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
terminate and be canceled at the Effective Time and shall cease to exist
without receiving any payment.

 

(c) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, take any and all actions
reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this  _Section 3.3_;
_provided_ that Parent shall have the reasonable opportunity to review and
promptly comment on any written corporate action to be taken by the Company.

 

Section 3.4 _Escrow and Stockholders  Representative Fund_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Fund an amount of
cash equal to the Escrow Amount as security for the
indemnification obligations pursuant to _Article 10_ and _Article 7_ , the
payment obligations under _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_ and the obligations under the
Support Agreements. The funds in the Escrow Fund shall be paid to Parent or
other Persons on and subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

(b) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit the Stockholders Representative
Fund Amount with the Stockholders Representative, to such account as notified
by the Stockholders Representative at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing.

 

Section 3.5 _Determination of Closing Cash Consideration_. Not less than three
(3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Initial Stockholder s Closing
Statement_") setting forth in reasonable detail the Companys good faith
calculation of (i) estimated Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the
" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) the difference between the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the Target Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment_ "), (iii) Employee Potential Payments, (iv)
the Company Indebtedness Payoff Amount and (v) the Closing Cash Consideration,
together with a reasonably detailed worksheet setting out the Companys
calculation of such items and each significant component thereof and
reasonably detailed backup data supporting such calculation. The Parties shall
discuss such calculations in good faith, and the Company, not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date shall

 



29  deliver to Parent a revised version of the Initial Stockholders Closing
Statement reflecting any such revisions to the Initial Stockholders Closing
Statement as the Company in good faith believes is warranted.

Section 3.6 _Determination of Final Cash Consideration_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date (but no later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date), Parent shall deliver to the
Stockholders Representative a statement (the " _Parent Adjustment Report_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail Parents good-faith calculation of (i) Net
Working Capital as of the Closing Date, (ii) the Employee Potential Payments,
(iii) the Company Indebtedness Payoff Amount and (iv) the Final Cash
Consideration.

 

(b) The following procedures shall apply with respect to the review of the
Parent Adjustment Report:

 

(i) The Stockholders Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Stockholders Representative of the Parent Adjustment
Report to review such Report (the " _Review Period_ "). During the Review
Period, Parent shall make available to the Stockholders Representative and
its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all
relevant personnel, Representatives of Parent, books and records of the
Acquired Companies and other items reasonably requested by the Stockholders
Representative in connection with the Stockholders Representatives review
of the Parent Adjustment Report and any dispute with respect thereto as
contemplated by this _Section 3.6_.

 

(ii) If the Stockholders Representative does not deliver to Parent a written
statement describing any objections the Stockholders Representative has to
the Parent Adjustment Report (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") on or before the
final day of the Review Period, then the Stockholders Representative shall be
deemed to have irrevocably accepted such Parent Adjustment Report, and such
Parent Adjustment Report shall be deemed to be the " _Final Adjustment Report_
" for purposes of the payment (if any) contemplated by _Section 3.6(c)_. If
the Stockholders Representative delivers to Parent a Notice of Disagreement
on or before the final day of the Review Period, then Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall attempt to resolve in good faith the
matters contained in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days after
Parents receipt of the Notice of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ ").
If Parent and the Stockholders Representative reach a resolution with respect
to such matters on or before the final day of the Resolution Period, then the
Parent Adjustment Report, as modified by such resolution, shall be deemed to
be the " _Final Adjustment Report_ " for purposes of the payment (if any)
contemplated by _Section 3.6(c)_. 

(iii) If such a resolution is not reached on or before the final day of the
Resolution Period, then Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the last
day of the Resolution Period) retain the Accounting Firm (including by
executing a customary agreement with the Accounting Firm in connection with
its engagement) and submit any unresolved objections covered by the Notice of
Disagreement (the " _Disputed Items_ ") to the Accounting Firm for resolution
in accordance with this _Section 3.6(b)(iii)_. The Accounting Firm will be
instructed to (A) make a final

 



30  determination on an expedited basis (and in any event within thirty (30)
days after submission of the Disputed Items) with respect to each of the
Disputed Items (and only the Disputed Items) that is within the range of the
respective positions taken by each of Parent and the Stockholders
Representative and (B) prepare and deliver to Parent and the Stockholders
Representative a written statement setting forth its final determination (and
a reasonably detailed description of the basis therefor) with respect to each
Disputed Item (the " _Accounting Firm s Report_"). After submission of the
Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each of Parent and the Stockholders
Representative may provide the Accounting Firm with a definitive statement in
writing of its positions with respect to the Disputed Items (and only the
Disputed Items). The Accounting Firm will be provided with reasonable access
to the books and records of Parent, and the Acquired Companies, for purposes
of making its final determination with respect to the Disputed Items, and
Parent and the Acquired Companies shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with
the Accounting Firm in connection therewith. Each of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative agrees that (1) the Accounting Firms
determination with respect to each Disputed Item as reflected in the
Accounting Firms Report shall be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding,
absent fraud or manifest error, (2) the Parent Adjustment Report, as modified
by any changes thereto in accordance with the Accounting Firms Report, shall
be deemed to be the " _Final Adjustment Report_ " for purposes of the payment
(if any) contemplated by _Section 3.6(c)_, (3) the procedures set forth in
this _Section 3.6_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the
final determination of the Final Adjustment Report (absent fraud or manifest
error) and (4) the Accounting Firms determination under this _Section
3.6(b)(iii)_ shall be enforceable as an arbitral award, and judgment may be
entered thereupon in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against
which such determination is to be enforced.

(iv) Each of Parent on the one hand and the Payment Parties (by means of a
release of such amounts from the Escrow Fund) on the other hand shall (A) pay
its own respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
_Section 3.6_ and (B) be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm.

(v) The Parties acknowledge and agree, for the avoidance of doubt, that if
and to the extent any item is taken into account as a reduction in Closing
Cash Consideration or Final Cash Consideration, such amount shall not cause
more than one reduction in Closing Cash Consideration or Final Cash
Consideration.

 

(c) Within two (2) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Report in accordance with this _Section 3.6 _(including by
failure to timely deliver a Notice of Disagreement):

(i) if the Additional Payment Amount is a positive number, then Parent shall
pay an amount in cash equal to the Additional Payment Amount to the
Stockholders Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds
who shall distribute the Additional Payment Amount to the Payment Parties
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portion; or

(ii) if the Additional Payment Amount is a negative number, then such
amount shall be paid to Parent from the Escrow Fund.

 



31 Section 3.7 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such customary and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article 3_.

Section 3.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, and
who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 3.1(b)_, but instead the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have otherwise waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his or
her right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the
DGCL shall cease and such shares shall no longer be considered Dissenting
Shares for purposes hereof and such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_.

 

Section 3.9 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be
no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Company of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer following the Effective Time,
they shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration, as
provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_, for each share of Company Capital
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. All Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Capital Stock.

 

Section 3.10 _Stockholder Consent_.

 

(a) The Company shall immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (but no later than twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), cause to be
delivered, in the manner required by DGCL Section 228, Stockholder Consents
representing at least eighty-five percent (85%) of each of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (the " _Requisite
Stockholder Consent_ "), which shall constitute the requisite

 



32  corporate approval under applicable Law by holders of Company Capital Stock
of this Agreement, the Merger, the conversion of all Company Capital Stock as
provided for in this Agreement, and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to

Stockholders until the Closing.

 

(b) Promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days after the date
of the Stockholder Consent, the Company shall:

 

(i) deliver notice to all holders of the Company Capital Stock of the approval
by the requisite number of holders of Company Capital Stock of this
Agreement, the Merger, the conversion of all the Company Capital Stock as
provided for in this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby,

(ii) provide to each holder of Company Capital Stock whose consent was not
obtained a copy of the notice required pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
informing such holder that appraisal rights are available for his, her or its
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL along
with such other information as required by Section 262 of the DGCL and
applicable Law (the " _Section 262 Notice_ "); and

 

(iii) a Letter of Transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(c) Without limiting the rights and remedies of Parent or any of the other
Indemnified Parties, the Stockholder Notices and the Section 262 Notice,
including any amendments or supplements thereto, shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent.

(d) Each Party shall provide to the other any information for inclusion in
the preparation of the Stockholder Consent, the Stockholder Notices or Section
262 Notices that may be required by Law and that is reasonably requested by
any other Party.

 

Section 3.11 _Withholding Tax_. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from, or in respect of, the Closing Cash Merger
Consideration or any other payment to be made hereunder any Taxes that Parent
and Merger Sub may be required to deduct and withhold under the provisions of
any Tax Laws, and all such withheld amounts shall be treated as delivered to
the Stockholders or the relevant recipient under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that as soon as practicable prior to any such deduction or
withholding from a Principal Stockholder, Parent shall provide notice of
the applicability of such withholding to the Stockholders Representative in
order for the affected Stockholders to obtain reduction of or relief from such

Company Intellectual Property and of each Company Product free and clear of

Company which obliges him to disclose and assign all right, title and interest
in and to such Intellectual Property Rights to such Acquired Company. There

such individuals to bring any such claims.

and immediately after the consummation of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement will continue to have such rights to, all material Intellectual
Property Rights that are used in or necessary for the conduct of the Business,
including with respect to Company Products.

 

(e) The Acquired Companies are not subject to any outstanding Order that
restricts or impairs the use of any Company Intellectual Property.  _Section
4.14(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists, as of the Execution Date,
all material Legal Proceedings (including any brought before the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) to

that such Acquired Company is Infringing the Intellectual Property Rights of
any third party (including any written notice that such Acquired Company must
license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property Rights of any third
party). To the Companys Knowledge, no third party is Infringing any material
Company Intellectual Property Rights, nor has any Acquired Company sent any
written communication alleging the foregoing.

 

(g) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated hereby, as a
result of any Contracts or Orders to which an Acquired Company is a party or
is otherwise bound, will cause: (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Companies) to grant to any third party any right to or with
respect to any Intellectual Property Rights owned by, or licensed to, any of
them, (ii) Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) to be bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other restriction

pay any royalties or other fees or consideration with respect to Intellectual
Property Rights of any third party in excess of those payable by the Acquired
Companies in the absence of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

institution or research center owns or has any rights to (or options to
obtain any rights to) any Company Products or Company Intellectual Property.

Public License (MPL), BSD licenses, the Artistic License, the Netscape Public
License, the Sun Community Source License (SCSL), the Sun Industry Standards
License (SISL) and the Apache License) (collectively, " _Open Source Software_

Company Intellectual Property, (i) require the disclosure or distribution of
any Company Product, or any other software included in Company Intellectual
Property, in source code form, (ii) require the licensing thereof for the
purpose of making derivative works or (iii) impose any restriction on the
consideration to be charged for the distribution thereof. With respect to any
Open Source Software that is currently used by any Acquired Company, such
Acquired Company is in material compliance with the applicable license with
respect thereto except to the extent that the failure to do so would not
impair, or otherwise impose a material restriction or obligation with respect
to any Company Products or Company Intellectual Property and would not result
in a Liability in excess of $500,000.

applicable Law or to any Governmental Authority.

(b) The Company uses commercially reasonable measures to ensure that all
software that is used by the Acquired Companies or otherwise included in any

the computer software industry).

(c) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has disclosed to Parent all
hardware (including computers, servers, peripheral devices and

Technology_ "). To the Companys Knowledge, all Information Technology
presently used in delivering services to customers is in good working order
and condition in all material respects and is sufficient for the purposes for
which it is used in the Business. No material capital expenditures (including
lease expenditures) are currently planned or are necessary to such
Information Technology in the Business as currently conducted, other than

401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS,
and, to the Companys Knowledge, no event or circumstance has occurred or
failed to occur that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. No condition exists that has subjected or would reasonably be
expected to subject any Acquired Company, either directly or by reason of
their affiliation with any member of their "Controlled Group" (defined as any
organization which is a member of a controlled group of organizations within
the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code), to any material
Tax, fine, lien or penalty or other Liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Laws in connection with any "employee benefit plan" (within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA). No nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code)
has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that has subjected or
would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or its Subsidiaries to
any material Liability. No Company Benefit Plan promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any Person.

the Law of the relevant jurisdiction, outside of the United States (each such
Company Benefit Plan, a " _Foreign Plan_ ") is listed in _Section 4.17(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedules. Each Foreign Plan is in material compliance
with the provisions of the Laws of each jurisdiction in which such Foreign
Plan is maintained, to the extent those Laws are applicable to such Foreign
Plan.

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan constitutes and no Acquired Company nor any member
has in the past six (6) years maintained or contributed to, a plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. At no time within the

to contribute to any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or any multiple employer plan (within the meaning of Sections 4063/4064
of ERISA and Section 413(c) of the Code) or any similar Laws of a foreign
jurisdiction. All Foreign Plans that are defined benefit plans are listed in
_Section 4.17(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

(f) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan, (i) no Legal Proceedings (other
than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to
the Companys Knowledge, threatened, (ii) to the Companys Knowledge, no facts
or circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such Legal Proceedings and (iii) to the Companys Knowledge, no administrative
investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the Department of
Labor, the IRS or any other governmental agencies are pending, in progress or
threatened. Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A) is in
documentary and operational compliance with Code Section 409A and
the applicable guidance issued thereunder in all material respects. No

which the Effective Time occurs cause to be waived any eligibility waiting
periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any
pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent such were
waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the
Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable Parent Plan for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs.

 



68 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Closing, the Company (i) will seek stockholder
approval that satisfies the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
of certain payments and benefits in the nature of compensation that would, but
for the approval described in this _Section 6.11(d)_, be treated as
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event), including, to the extent applicable, any
such payments or benefits or accelerated vesting with respect to Company
Benefit Plans and any other arrangements and payments or benefits pursuant to
arrangements entered into by Parent or the Surviving Corporation and any
"disqualified individual" prior to the Closing (collectively, the "
_Compensatory Arrangements_ ") such that, to the extent such amounts are
approved by the stockholders of the Company as contemplated by this _Section
6.11(d)_, no "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and
payment of such amounts would not result in a loss of deduction under Section
280G of the Code; and (ii) make disclosure of the Compensatory Arrangements
that satisfies the requirements of Section 280G of the Code to all
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote under Section 280G of the Code.

 

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.11_ with respect to employees of the Acquired Companies are
included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not
create any right (i) in any other Person, including any employees, former
employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Benefit
Plan or Parent Plan or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. After the Effective
Time, nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ is intended to be or shall be
considered to be an amendment of any plan, program, agreement, arrangement or
policy of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation nor shall it interfere with Parents, the Surviving Corporations
or any of its Subsidiaries right to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or to terminate the employment of any employee of the Acquired
Companies for any reason.

 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall promptly pay to the recipients thereof the
Employee Potential Payments  Contingent as they become due (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter) other than any payment due to the
Sole MIA Participant. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after such time that any Employee Potential Payment  Contingent
becomes no longer payable to the intended recipient (whether because it is
forfeited, unearned, waived or otherwise not paid), the Surviving Corporation
shall pay such Employee Potential Payment  Contingent to the
Stockholders Representative for further distribution to the Payment Parties.

an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any stockholder or any of their
respective Affiliates or any officer, director, or employee of such

coverage provided by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will the Company or Parent be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of
two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company under its current policy.

(c) Following the Effective Time, the Indemnitees to whom this _Section
6.13_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.13_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.13_ are intended to be for the benefit of and

representatives. The indemnification and insurance rights provided for herein
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation

ARTICLE 7

TAX MATTERS 

Section 7.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

 



73 (a) From and after the Closing, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall
severally and not jointly (pro rata in accordance with such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion) indemnify and hold each of Parent and Merger Sub and
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) (each, a
" _Tax Indemnitee_ "), harmless in accordance with the provisions of _Article
10_ from any and all Taxes levied or imposed on the Acquired Companies in
respect of its income, Business, property or operations or for which the
Acquired Companies may otherwise be liable (i) for any period ending prior to
or on the Closing Date, including the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date, and including Taxes arising out of the transactions and
deemed transactions contemplated in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable under this clause (i) only to
the extent that any such Tax exceeds the amount, if any, reserved for such Tax
in the Final Working Capital (" _Current Taxes Payable_ "); (ii) for any
obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated,
combined, or unitary basis with respect to a group of corporations of which
the Payment Parties or any subsidiary of the Payment Parties (other than the
Acquired Companies), are or were the common parent; (iii) except as otherwise
provided in _Section 7.5_, for any costs or expenses of contests or
controversies relating to Taxes indemnified hereunder; or (iv) a sale
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date that is accounted for under the
installment method of accounting as defined in section 453(c) of the Code (or
any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
Law). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will a Tax
Indemnitee be indemnified pursuant to this Agreement for (i) any Taxes of the
Acquired Companies for any taxable period or portion thereof commencing after
the Closing, or (ii) any Taxes arising from, and attributable to, any
discretionary act, omission or transaction that is initiated by Parent or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the Acquired Companies outside the ordinary
course of business any time after Closing (including on the Closing Date but
after Closing), and that are not otherwise contemplated in this _Article 7_ ,
or (iii) any employer-paid employment taxes resulting from cashing out Company
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in the Acquired Companies where the
payment of employment taxes reduces the amount of such employment taxes that
would be payable later in the year of the Closing.

 

(b) If, during any taxable period beginning prior to the final release of the
Escrow Fund, a Tax Indemnitee derives a Tax benefit (including without
limitation a refund, credit, or reduction in Tax) that is attributable,
directly or indirectly, to an event or circumstance for which it received an
indemnity payment under this _Section 7.1_, and the Tax Indemnitee
determines, in its commercially reasonable judgment, that the effect of the
Tax benefit is to reduce or offset, in whole or in part, the cost for which it
was indemnified, then the Tax Indemnitee shall rebate to the Payment Parties
the amount of the actual economic savings that it reasonably determines to be
attributable to that reduction or offset.

(c) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 7.1_
shall be made pursuant to, and subject to the conditions and limitations
contained in, _Article 10_.

 

Section 7.2 _Apportionment of Taxes_.

 

(a) With respect to any Taxes imposed upon any Acquired Company that are
payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that
are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall, (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to
income, receipts or shareholders equity or (B) imposed in 

 



74  connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale,
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)
be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year ended on
the Closing Date, (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those described above
in clause (i)) imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the Acquired
Companies or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (iii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed
as a result of transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are outside
the ordinary course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes that is properly allocable (based on,
among other relevant factors, factors set forth in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date prior to
the Closing. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any
exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual
basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date on a _pro rata_ basis determined by multiplying the entire amount
of such item allocated to the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon
or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or
intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this _Section
7.2(a)_ shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on the
Closing Date.

 

(b) The Stockholders Representative (for further distribution to the Payment
Parties) shall be entitled to be paid any refunds or credits (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto) in respect of any Liability
for any Tax of the Payment Parties or any of their Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies), for any Tax periods or portion thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date (including any Taxes allocated to such period under
_Section 7.2(a)_) or for which the Indemnifying Parties are otherwise liable
under _Section 7.1_. The Stockholders Representative may request the
Acquired Companies pursue a claim for refund for any Tax periods or portion
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, in which case any such claim for
refund shall be treated as a Contest for purposes of _Section 7.5_,
_provided_ that the cost of contesting such Contest shall be borne by the
Stockholders Representative. The Acquired Companies shall be entitled to any
refunds or credits (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto) in respect of any Liability for any Tax of the Acquired Companies or
any of its Affiliates, for any Tax periods or portion thereof beginning after
the Closing Date (including any Taxes allocated to such period under _Section
7.2(a)_) and for which the Indemnifying Parties do not have an
indemnification obligation under _Section 7.1_. Each Party shall cause any
amount to which the other Party is entitled under this _Section 7.2(b)_, but
which is received or credited to the Party not so entitled or any of such
Partys Affiliates, at any time after the Closing Date, to be paid to the
Party so entitled in immediately available funds promptly after receipt (or,
if the amount of the credit or refund is applied against any other Liability
of the Party not so entitled, within ten days of the notice of such
application).

Section 7.3 _Transfer Tax_. All excise, sales, transfer, documentary, filing,
recordation and other similar taxes, levies, fees and charges, if any
(including all real estate

 



75  transfer taxes and conveyance and recording fees, if any), that may be
imposed upon, or payable or collectible or incurred in connection with, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
shall be borne equally by the Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the
Payment Parties, and Parent. Parent shall be responsible for preparing and
timely filing any Tax Returns required with respect to any such Transfer
Taxes. Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate with each
other in order to minimize applicable Transfer Taxes in a manner that is
mutually agreeable and in compliance with applicable Law, and shall to that
extent execute such documents, agreements, applications, instruments, or other
forms as reasonably required, and shall permit any such Transfer Taxes to be
assessed and paid in accordance with applicable Law.

 

Section 7.4 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) (i) The Indemnifying Parties shall be responsible for the timely filing
(taking into account any extensions received from the relevant tax
authorities) of all Tax Returns required by Law to (A) be filed by the
Acquired Companies on or prior to the Closing Date or (B) include the Acquired
Companies in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by the
Indemnifying Parties or any of their Affiliates (other than any Tax
Indemnitee) with respect to any taxable period ending prior to or including
the Closing Date, (ii) such Tax Returns shall be correct and complete in all
material respects and accurately set forth all items to the extent required
to be reflected or included in such Tax Returns by applicable Tax Laws and
(iii) all Taxes indicated as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall be paid
or will be paid by the Indemnifying Parties as and when required by Law. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed on a basis consistent with those
prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is
required by an intervening change in Law, closing agreement or
other settlement entered into with a Taxing Authority, or decision of a
judicial authority.

(b) The Acquired Companies (or, where relevant, the combined or consolidated
group of which the Acquired Companies are members) shall be responsible for
the timely filing (taking into account any extensions received from the
relevant Tax Authorities) of all Tax Returns required by Law to be filed
by the Acquired Companies, or to include the Acquired Companies, after the
Closing Date.

(c) The Acquired Companies shall not take positions, make elections or use
methods on Tax Returns that deviate substantively from positions taken,
elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns
(any such deviation being a " _Position Change_ "); _provided_  that the
Acquired Companies may make a Position Change, if (i) doing so would not
increase the amount of the indemnity (assuming no Position Change) to be paid
to any Tax Indemnitee by the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to  _Section
7.1_, or (ii) the Stockholders Representative consents to such Position
Change, such consent not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, as determined in
accordance with the resolution procedures provided in  _Section 7.4(d)_ and
_Section 7.4(e)_.

(d) The Acquired Companies shall submit any Tax Returns that could give rise
to a claim for indemnification to the Stockholders Representative not later
than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns
(giving effect to valid extensions) (or, if such due date is within forty-
five (45) days following the Closing Date, or in the case of any

 



76  amended Tax Return or Tax Return for which the due date has passed, as
promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) for review by the
Stockholders Representative. If the Stockholders Representative objects in
writing to a change in position that it believes in good faith could give rise
to a claim for indemnification under _Section 7.1_, then the Stockholders
Representative shall notify Parent of such disputed items and the basis for
its objection within fifteen (15) days of the day of receipt of such Tax
Return, and the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall act in good
faith to resolve the dispute for as long as reasonably possible consistently
with filing the Tax Return on time.

(e) If it is not possible to resolve any such dispute prior to the filing
date (or, in the case of any amended Tax Return or Tax Return for which the
due date has passed, within 30 days of the receipt by the Acquired Companies
of the Stockholders Representatives written objection in accordance with 
_Section 7.4(d)_), then the Acquired Companies shall have sole authority to
determine the form and content of their Tax Returns. If a claim for
indemnification under _Section 7.1_ is made in respect of any such Tax
Return, and the Stockholders Representative believes that the liability is
attributable to a position that it has disputed in writing, then the
Stockholders Representative may request that the dispute be presented to the
Accounting Firm. If the Accounting Firm determines that (i) the liability for
which indemnification is claimed is attributable to the disputed position, and
(ii) the Stockholders Representatives refusal to pay the indemnity claim in
respect of such position is unreasonable, then the Acquired Companies shall
be entitled to indemnification for the amount that the Accounting Firm
determines to be attributable to the disputed position. The determination of
the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on both parties and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

(f) The Acquired Companies shall not file (i) any amended Tax Returns or (ii)
any Tax Returns in any jurisdiction in which the Acquired Companies have not
previously filed a Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Period, without the consent
of the Stockholders Representative, such consent not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, as determined in accordance with the resolution
procedures provided in _Section 7.4(d)_ and _Section 7.4(e)_.

 

Section 7.5 _Contests_.

 

(a) The Tax Indemnitee shall notify the Stockholders Representative in
writing promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, of becoming aware
of the commencement after the Closing Date of any Contest that could give rise
to an indemnification payment under _Section 7.1_ (the specific issues that
could give rise to such indemnification are referred to herein as " _Tax
Indemnifiable Matters_ "). Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known to the Tax Indemnitee or its Affiliates) with respect to Tax
Indemnifiable Matters in reasonable detail and shall include copies of
any notice or other document (to the extent such notice or document relates
to Tax Indemnifiable Matters) received from any Governmental Authority in
respect thereof.

 

(b) The Tax Indemnitee shall control all Contests, but to the extent that a
Contest involves issues for which the Tax Indemnitee may be entitled to a
payment under _Section 7.1(a)_, the Stockholders Representative or its duly
appointed representatives shall be allowed to attend all meetings between the
Tax Indemnitee and the Governmental Authority in 

 



77  question and shall be provided with copies of all material correspondence
and documents, to the extent relating to Tax Indemnifiable Matters. Neither
the Tax Indemnitee nor any of its Affiliates may settle or compromise any
asserted Tax liability in a Contest, to the extent relating to Tax
Indemnifiable Matters, without the consent of the Stockholders
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
For the avoidance of doubt, a Tax Indemnitees decision not to contest a
Contest will be considered to be a settlement of that Contest for purposes of
the preceding sentence. For purposes of this _Section 7.5(b)_, if the Tax
Indemnitee and the Stockholders Representative cannot come to agreement as
to whether consent is being, or will be, unreasonably withheld or delayed
within 30 days of the Stockholders Representatives initial refusal to
provide consent, such disagreement shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm.
The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on both
parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent or one of its Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall have the right to prohibit the
Stockholders Representative from participating in any Contest as it relates
to a specific matter if Parent and Tax Indemnitee(s) have waived their rights
to indemnity for such matter.

 

Section 7.6 _Prior Tax Sharing Agreements_. This Agreement terminates and
supersedes any and all other tax sharing or allocation agreements in effect
on the date hereof as between the Payment Parties or any predecessor or
Affiliate thereof on the one hand, and the Acquired Companies on the other
hand, for all taxes imposed by any federal, state, foreign or
local government or Taxing Authority, regardless of the period for which such
taxes are imposed, and obligations of or to the Acquired Companies pursuant to
any such agreement shall be extinguished as of the Closing Date.

 

Section 7.7 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. After the Closing, Parent and the
Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative on
the other hand, will make available to the other, as reasonably requested, and
to any Taxing Authority, all information, records or documents relating to the
Liability for Taxes or potential Liability of the Acquired Companies for
Taxes for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date and will preserve
such information, records or documents until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations or extensions thereof.

 

Section 7.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. All matters relating to Taxes will be governed
exclusively by this _Article 7_ and  _Article 10_ following the Closing,
except to the extent specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement.

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article 10_ , from and
after the Closing, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall, severally and not

Portion), indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation, their
respective affiliates and the Representatives of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective affiliates (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all Losses, incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any
of them (including the Company and the Surviving Corporation) in connection
with or as a result of the following (the " _Indemnifiable Matters_ "):

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty by the Company

breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty (other than the Unscraped
Representations) has occurred and when determining the amount of Losses
suffered as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty, any representation or warranty given or made by the Company that is
qualified or limited in scope as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect
(excluding the representation and warranty in  _Section 4.10(a)(ii)_) shall
be deemed to have been made or given without such qualification or limitation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether a breach or inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.12(a)_ has
occurred, such representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been
given or made with the phrase "expected to be material to the Acquired
Companies taken as a whole" replacing the phrase "expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect." For the
avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to the
terms "Material Subsidiary" or "Material Contract" or the definitions
thereof. " _Unscraped Representations_ " means the representations and
warranties set forth in (A) _S_ _ection 4.6_; (B) _Section 4.7_ (other

_Section 4.10(a)(ii)_; (F) _Section 4.12(a)_; (G) _Section
4.13(a)(i)_; (H) _Section 4.13(a)(vii)_; (I) _Section 4.13(a)(viii)_; (J)
_Section 4.13(a)(xii)_; (K) _Section 4.13(a)(xiii)_; (L) _Section
4.17(a)_ (other than clause (ii)); and (M) the first sentence of _Section
4.23_.

(c) The Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Parties from any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (except
with respect to Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties contained in the first sentence of _Section 4.17(g)_) unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses actually incurred by the Indemnified
Parties and which are Indemnifiable Matters under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_
exceeds $7,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then for only such amounts in
excess of the Deductible.

(d) Except to the extent an officer or director of the Company prior to the
Closing is an indemnified person under any indemnification or insurance
policies provided by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section
6.13_, the Indemnifying Parties and their Affiliates shall not have any right
of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement or reimbursement
from Parent or the Surviving Corporation, any Organizational Document, any Law
or otherwise with respect to any Indemnifiable Matters and any such right is
hereby waived in its entirety to the extent required to give effect to this
_Section 10.2(d)_.

(e) Except as provided in _Article 7_ , this _Article 10_ shall constitute
the exclusive remedy after the Closing for recovery of Losses by the
Indemnified Parties as a result of breaches of representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_

  



85  that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party for (i)
fraud, (ii) in connection with any breach of a representation or warranty in
or failure to perform any obligation pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement or
(iii) in seeking or obtaining specific performance and other equitable relief;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any Indemnifying
Partys aggregate Liability to the Indemnified Parties for monetary damages in
respect of this Agreement (including for breaches of Fundamental
Representations) exceed the aggregate amount of consideration actually
received by such Person (in such Persons capacity or capacities as an
Indemnifying Party) pursuant to this Agreement (assuming for such purposes
that the Escrow Amount was paid in full to the Indemnifying Parties at
the Closing).

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if and to the extent the amount of a Loss
is recovered by an Indemnified Party through the actual payment of a Payable
Claim to such Indemnified Party, the same amount of such Loss may not be
recovered again by such Indemnified Party by reason of such Loss being subject
to indemnification under more than one provision of this Agreement and (ii)
if and to the extent that a Loss in connection with an Indemnifiable Matter
was taken into account in the calculation of the Final Working Capital
Adjustment, the same amount of such Loss may not be recovered under this 
_Article 10_ , but, in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and
(ii), the amount, if any, of Loss that exceeds the amount already recovered
under clause (i) or already taken into account as described in clause (ii)
shall be recoverable on and subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article 10_.

(g) Where the Indemnifying Parties have made a payment to an Indemnified
Party in relation to any claim under this _Article 10_ and Parent or any of
its Affiliates (which shall include the Surviving Corporation and the Acquired
Companies following the Closing) are entitled to recover (whether by
insurance, payment, discount, credit, relief or otherwise) from a third party
a sum which indemnifies or compensates Parent Indemnified Parties (in whole or
in part) in respect of the Loss which is the subject of a claim, Parent or
its relevant Affiliates shall (i) promptly notify the Indemnifying Parties of
the fact and provide such information as the Indemnifying Parties may
reasonably require, (ii) take all reasonable steps or proceedings as the
Indemnifying Parties may require to enforce such right and (iii) pay to the
Indemnifying Parties, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt, an
amount equal to the amount actually recovered from the third party (net of
taxation and less any reasonable costs of recovery).

(h) For all purposes of this Agreement, " _Losses_ " for purposes of this
_Article 10_ shall be net of any Tax benefits that are actually received by
the Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses, _provided_ that if any
payment is made by an Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses and the
Indemnified Party later actually realizes a Tax benefit in respect of those
Losses that has not been previously taken into account in computing that
payment, then the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party an
amount equal to the Tax savings resulting from such Tax benefit.

 

Section 10.3 _Recovery From the Escrow Fund_. Other than with respect to
breaches or inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations, claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(vi)_ or in respect of fraud, the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Article 7_ and this _Article 10_
shall be enforced solely by the right of the Indemnified Parties to recover
the amount of a Loss from the Escrow Fund to the extent of available funds.
All claims

 



86  for breaches or inaccuracies in Fundamental Representations shall first be
satisfied by release of funds from the Escrow Fund until the Escrow Fund has
been depleted (but for the avoidance of doubt recovery for such claims shall
not be limited to the Escrow Fund). Notwithstanding the several nature of the
indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this _Article
10_ or anything to the contrary contained herein, the Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover the full amount of all Losses indemnifiable
pursuant to this _Article 10_ , for Taxes indemnifiable pursuant to _Article
7_ and in respect of any breach of a Support Agreement or any indemnification
obligation set forth in a Support Agreement, from the Escrow Fund to the
extent of available funds, regardless of how such Losses will be borne by the
Indemnifying Parties as a result of such recovery. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Indemnified Parties may, but shall not be
required to, enforce the indemnification obligations set forth in any Support
Agreement or pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(vi)_ or seek damages resulting from
a breach of any Support Agreement first by recovery of Losses from the Escrow
Fund.

Section 10.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

(a) All Claims for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 10_ shall be made
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 10.4_. An
Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders Representative written notice
of any such Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which notice shall include a
description in reasonable detail of (i) the basis for, and nature of, such
Claim, including the facts constituting the basis for such Claim, and (ii) the
amount of the Losses reasonably estimated in good faith that have been or
would reasonably be expected to be sustained or accrued by the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Claim. Any Claim Notice shall be given by the
Indemnified Party to the Stockholders Representative, (A) in the case of a
Claim in connection with any Legal Proceeding made or brought by any Person
(other than an Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement) against
such Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), reasonably promptly
following receipt of notice of the assertion or commencement of such
Legal Proceeding and (B) in the case of a Claim other than a Third-Party
Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), reasonably promptly after the Indemnified Party
determines that it intends to seek indemnification for such Direct Claim; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no failure to give such prompt written notice
shall relieve the Indemnifying Parties of any of its or their indemnification
obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Parties are
materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure.

(b) With respect to any Third-Party Claim, the Stockholders Representative
shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party
within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Claim Notice with respect to
such Third-Party Claim, to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim at the Indemnifying Parties expense, with counsel of its choosing that
is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Stockholders Representative shall not have the right to control the
defense of any Third-Party Claim that (i) seeks any injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, or (ii) seeks monetary damages
the amount of which would reasonably be expected to exceed any limitation on
the amount of Losses that may be recovered as set forth in _Section 10.3_
(after satisfaction of other pending Claims) or (iii) has been brought by or
on behalf of any customer or supplier of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(which Affiliates shall include the Surviving Corporation and Acquired
Companies) with respect to such customer or supplier relationship. The
Indemnified

 



87  Party or Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, that is not
controlling such defense shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to
participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by
it; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Parties or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Parties
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel
to the Indemnified Party. If the Stockholders Representative may not or
elects not to control the defense of such Third-Party Claim (including by
failing to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to control such defense in accordance with this _Section 10.4(b)_)
or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may control the defense of such Third-Party Claim with
counsel of its choosing. Parent and each of the Indemnifying Parties and the
Stockholders Representative shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including by retaining
and providing to the Party controlling such defense records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim and making available
employees on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnified Party or
the Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, that is controlling such
defense shall keep the other Party reasonably advised of the status of such
Legal Proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith any
recommendations made by the other Party with respect thereto.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither
the Stockholders Representative nor the Indemnifying Parties shall agree to
any settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed unless such settlement would (A) include a complete and
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all Liabilities or
obligations with respect thereto, (B) not impose any Liability on
the Indemnified Party and (C) not involve a finding or admission of any
wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party and (ii) an Indemnified Party
shall not agree to any settlement of a Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) _Escrow Amount Set-off for Losses_.

(i) A " _Payable Claim_ " means a Claim in respect of amounts held in the
Escrow Fund (whether pursuant to  _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_, _Article 7_ ,
_Article 10_ , or any Support Agreement) to the extent that such Claim has
been either (A) mutually agreed by the Stockholders Representative and Parent
or (B) subject of a final non-appealable court order and has not yet been
satisfied by cash payment or by release to the Indemnified Party of funds from
the Escrow Fund. An " _Unresolved Claim_ " means any Claim in respect of
amounts held in the Escrow Fund (whether pursuant to _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_,
_Article 7_ , _Article 10_ , or any Support Agreement) to the extent that such
Claim is not a Payable Claim and has not been satisfied by cash payment or
release to the Indemnified Party of funds from the Escrow Fund or otherwise.

(ii) By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the obligations
provided for in  _Article 10_ , _Article 7_ , _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_ and the
Support Agreements,

 



88  subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnified Parties shall have
the right, and shall be required, in the manner provided in this _Section
10.4(d)_ and  _Section 10.5_, to recover the amount of any Losses with
respect to which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
hereunder first by the release of funds from the Escrow Fund.

 

(iii) On the date any Claim becomes a Payable Claim, payment of the amount of
such Payable Claim from the Escrow Fund (to the extent of available funds)
shall be made to the Indemnified Parties in accordance with _Section
10.5(b)_). The Dollar amount of the aggregate reductions of the Escrow Amount
shall reduce the Payable Claims by the exact same Dollar amount.

 

(iv) At each Escrow Release Time, a payment equal to the applicable Escrow
Remainder shall be paid from the Escrow Fund to an account specified by the
Stockholders Representative (which shall then distribute such payment to each
Payment Party in accordance with such Payment Partys Pro Rata Portion).

 

Section 10.5 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Amount (plus any interest paid on such Escrow
Amount) (collectively, as such amount may be adjusted as set forth herein,
the " _Escrow Fund_ ") shall be available to compensate Parent and the
Indemnified Parties for any Claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or
incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery as provided in
this _Article 10_ , _Article 7_ or any Support Agreement and to make payments
as provided in _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_.

 

(b) _Satisfaction of Claims_. If any claim becomes a Payable Claim, Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall promptly deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to the
applicable Indemnified Party an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the
amount of such Payable Claim.

 

Section 10.6 _Stockholders  Representative_.

 

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Stockholders  Representative_"
shall mean Global Acquisition LLC, or any Person appointed as a successor
Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 10.6_. Global
Acquisition LLC hereby accepts its appointment as the initial Stockholders
Representative. Effective upon the Closing, without any further action by any
other Person, the Stockholders Representative shall be appointed and
constituted in respect of each Indemnifying Party, as his, her or its agent,
to act in his, her or its name, place and stead, as such Indemnifying Partys
attorney-in-fact, to give and receive notices and communications in connection
with this Agreement and related matters, including in connection with Claims
for indemnification under this _Article 10_ and _Article 7_ and to determine
the Closing Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.5_ and the Final Cash
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.6_, and to agree to, negotiate, and
enter into settlements, adjustments and compromises of, and
demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to, such Claims, and to take all other actions that are either
(i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be

 



89  changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than ten
(10) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided_ , that the Stockholders
Representative may not be removed unless the Payment Parties that are
entitled to a majority of the funds remaining in the Escrow Fund agree in
writing to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A
vacancy in the position of the Stockholders Representative may be filled by
the Payment Parties that are entitled to a majority of the funds remaining in
the Escrow Fund. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties.

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.4_ and _Section 11.5_, shall constitute a decision
of all the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the Indemnifying Parties. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of all the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and
Parent, the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any Liability to
any Indemnifying Party for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative. 

(c) Neither the Stockholders Representative (nor any of the directors,
officers, agents or employees of the Stockholders Representative, if
applicable) shall be liable to any Indemnifying Party for any error of
judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, under this
Agreement, except in the case of the Stockholders Representatives
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders
Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by the Stockholders Representative and shall not
be liable to any Indemnifying Party for any action taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or experts. As to any matters not expressly provided for in this Agreement,
the Stockholders Representative shall not be required to exercise any
discretion or take any action.

(d) Each Indemnifying Party shall, only to the extent of and in proportion to
the portion of the consideration received by such Indemnifying Party,
indemnify and defend the Stockholders Representative and hold the
Stockholders Representative harmless against any loss, damage, cost,
Liability or expense incurred without fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct by the Stockholders Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Stockholders Representatives duties under this Agreement. Any Liabilities,
losses, penalties, fines, claims, damages, out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Stockholders
Representative in connection with the acceptance, performance and
administration of his or her duties as the Stockholders Representative
pursuant to this Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel, accountants
or auditors and other advisors pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
but excluding any of the foregoing arising out of the Stockholders
Representatives fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct) and all fees
payable hereunder to the Stockholders Representative by the Indemnifying
Parties (collectively, the " _Stockholders  Representatives Costs_"), shall
be paid as follows: (i) first by recourse to the Stockholders Representative
Fund Amount; (ii) if such amounts are insufficient to pay such Stockholders
Representatives Costs, then by recourse to the amounts in the Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to

 



90  the terms hereof; and (iii) if such amounts are insufficient to pay such
Stockholders Representatives Costs, then by recourse directly to the
Indemnifying Parties (in proportion to the pro rata portion of the Escrow
Fund otherwise to be received by such Indemnifying Parties). Any portion of
the Stockholders Representative Fund Amount remaining following the final
release of the Escrow Fund, the resolution of all Third-Party Claims and
Direct Claims and any other amounts to be distributed by the Stockholders
Representative to the Payment Parties, shall be distributed by the
Stockholders Representative to the Payment Parties in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions.

Section 10.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this _Article 10_ or _Article 7_ shall be

Section 11.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules,
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and any other
agreements, instruments or documents being or to be executed and delivered by
a Party or any of its Affiliates pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement together constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties
with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede
all other prior understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with
respect to such subject matter.

 

Section 11.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto and executed by each of the Parties; provided, that no
amendment shall be made that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Parties without the further approval of such
stockholders. 

Section 11.5 _Waivers_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
either Party may, at any time, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained herein or (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. No waiver by any Party of any of
the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by the Party so waiving. No waiver
by any Party of any breach of this Agreement shall operate or be construed as
a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach, whether of a similar or
different character, unless expressly set forth in such written waiver.
Neither any course of conduct or failure or delay of any Party in exercising
or enforcing any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy or power hereunder, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right, remedy or power, or any course of conduct,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy or power.

 

Section 11.6 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any situation or in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision hereof
or the offending term or provision in any other situation or any other
jurisdiction, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either
Party. Upon any such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



93 Section 11.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) to the
extent provided in _Article 10_ , (ii) with respect to the Financing Sources,
which shall be third party beneficiaries of _Section 9.2_, this _Section
11.7_, _Section 11.9_ and _Section 11.10_ and (iii) following termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_ , for the right of the Company on
behalf of the Stockholders to pursue damages (including claims for damages
based on loss of the economic benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the Stockholders) in the event the Effective Time has not
occurred as a result of Parents or Merger Subs Intentional Breach of this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall be
construed to confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. This Agreement may be amended or terminated, and any provision of
this Agreement may be waived, in accordance with the terms hereof without the
consent of any Person other than the Parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
_Section 9.2_, this _Section 11.7_, _Section 11.9_ and _Section 11.10_ may
not be amended or waived in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect
to the Financing Sources without written consent of the Financing Sources.

Section 11.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, and
any purported assignment or delegation in contravention of this  _Section
11.8_ shall be null and void and of no force and effect. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub may, without the prior written
consent of the Company, assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or
in part, to one or more of its Affiliates or, for collateral purposes, to the
Financing Sources; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve Parent and Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentences of this _Section 11.8_, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 11.9 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
all rights of the Parties (whether sounding in contract, tort, common or
statutory Law, equity or otherwise), shall be interpreted, construed and
governed by and in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than those of the State
of Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle
County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that all Claims in respect of any such Legal
Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (iii) agrees that it
shall not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any

 



94  Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether in contract, tort, common
or statutory Law, equity or otherwise) in any other court and (v) agrees that
a final judgment in any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding
sentence shall not limit the jurisdiction of the Accounting Firm as set forth
in _Section 3.6_ and shall include any Legal Proceeding brought for the
purpose of enforcing the jurisdiction and judgments of the Accounting Firm.
Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any Legal Proceeding brought in accordance with this _Section
11.9(b)_. Each of the Parties agrees that the service of any
process, summons, notice or document in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 11.2_ or in such other manner
as may be permitted by applicable Law, will be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

 

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER
IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE
DEBT FINANCING OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT,
THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER, THE PARTIES
HERETO AGREE THAT (I) SUCH CLAIMS, SUITS, ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE
SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR
ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT, IN EACH CASE, SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, AND
(II) THEY SHALL NOT BRING OR PERMIT ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES TO BRING OR
SUPPORT ANYONE ELSE IN BRINGING ANY SUCH CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN
ANY OTHER COURT.

(d) EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT FINANCING
COMMITMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION, (III) UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND (IV) MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY.

 



95 Section 11.10 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy expressly conferred hereby, and the exercise
by a Party of any one such remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
such remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
terms and that, although monetary damages may be available for such a breach,
monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, each of
the Parties agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of
any provision of this Agreement by such Party, the other Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches hereof
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. A Party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof shall not be required to
provide, furnish or post any bond or other security in connection therewith,
and each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
provision, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. In the
event that any Legal Proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, each Party agrees that it shall not allege, and
each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy
available at Law.

 

(c) In no event shall any Person, in any event, be liable pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise for punitive, indirect, exemplary or special damages
or consequential damages, including loss of revenue, income or profits, ("
_Limited Damages_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , nothing contained in this
_Section 11.10(c)_ shall restrict the ability of a Person to recover Losses
for consequential damages, including loss of revenue, income or profits to the
extent that such Losses were the direct and foreseeable consequence of the
relevant breach and were not occasioned by special circumstances relating
to such Person. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party is held liable pursuant to a Third Party
Claim (including a Third Party Claim by any Governmental Authority) for any
such Limited Damages and the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for the matter that gave rise to such Limited Damages
pursuant to _Article 10_ , then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for and
obligated to reimburse the Indemnified Party for such Limited Damages paid to
such third party.

(d) None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company or
its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder. In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

Indemnified Party wherein any Indemnified Party asserts or prosecutes any
claim under, or otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub agree in connection with such proceeding (a) that no Indemnified Party or
counsel therefor will move to seek disqualification of Shearman and Sterling

including any transaction (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), negotiation, investigation, proceeding or action, prior to the

a Delaware corporation

 

ARTICLE ONE

The name of the Corporation is [Gyro] Group, Inc.

ARTICLE TWO

 

The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is located
at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801, and the
name of the registered agent whose office address will be the same as the
registered office is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

ARTICLE THREE

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

 

ARTICLE FOUR

The total number of shares of capital stock that the Corporation has
authority to issue is 1,000 shares, which will be designated Common Stock, par
value $0.01 per share.

 

ARTICLE FIVE

The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

ARTICLE SIX

 

Unless, and except to the extent that, the Bylaws of the Corporation (the "
_Bylaws_ ") so require, the election of directors need not be by written
ballot.

ARTICLE SEVEN

 

The board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") may
from time to time adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws, subject to the power of
the stockholders to adopt any Bylaws or to amend or repeal any Bylaws adopted,
amended or repealed by the Board of Directors.

 

ARTICLE EIGHT

(1) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether  civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or
in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good
faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo_
_contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was unlawful.

 

(2) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the
person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if
the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery
or such other court shall deem proper.

(3) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections (1) and (2) of this Article
Eight, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall
be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.

(4) Any indemnification under Sections (1) and (2) of this Article Eight
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the
circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in such Sections (1) and (2). Such determination shall be made, with
respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such
determination, (a) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to
such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (b) by a
committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors,
even 

 



2  though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors, or if such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d)
by the stockholders of the Corporation.

(5) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit
or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation authorized in this Article Eight. Such expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees
and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the
Corporation deems appropriate.

(6) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other sections of this Article Eight shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, bylaw, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

 

(7) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of Section 145 of
the General Corporation Law.

 

(8) For purposes of this Article Eight, references to "the Corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent
Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and
employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this
Article Eight with respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as such
person would have with respect to such constituent Corporation if its
separate existence had continued.

(9) For purposes of this Article Eight, references to "other
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines"
shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves service by, such
director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan,
its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and
in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article Eight.

 



3 (10) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article Eight shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

ARTICLE NINE

 

The directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the stockholders
to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper purpose; to
authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or any part of
the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and disposition of any
surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the declaration and payment
of dividends.

ARTICLE TEN

 

The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval
or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting
of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or
contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the
vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which
is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote
thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in
person or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and
upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every
stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not the contract or act would
otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interest, or for any
other reason.

 

ARTICLE ELEVEN

In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation;  _subject_ , _nevertheless_ , to the provisions of the
statutes of Delaware, of this certificate, and to any bylaws from time to time
made by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that no bylaws so made
shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid
if such bylaw had not been made.

ARTICLE TWELVE

 

The Corporation shall, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time, indemnify all
persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

 

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended from time to
time, shall not apply to the Corporation.

ESCROW AGREEMENT

This Escrow Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
[] 2013 (the " _Closing Date_ "), by and among Open Text Corporation, a
corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada (" _Parent_ "), Global
Acquisition LLC (the " _Stockholders  Representative_"), and U.S. Bank
National Association, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Ocelot Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), [Gyro] Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and the Stockholders Representative have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 4, 2013
(the " _Merger Agreement_ ") a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ , pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with
the Company surviving such merger.

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to _Section 3.4_ of the Merger Agreement, at Closing (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), Parent shall deposit an amount of cash
equal to US$60,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") with the Escrow Agent as
security for the indemnification obligations pursuant to _Article 10_ and
_Article 7_ of the Merger Agreement, obligations under the Support Agreements
and the payment obligations under _Section 3.6(c)(ii)_ of the Merger
Agreement.

WHEREAS, pursuant to  _Section 10.6_ of the Merger Agreement, the
Stockholders Representative has been appointed and constituted in respect of
each Indemnifying Party (as defined in the Merger Agreement), as his, her or
its agent, to act in his, her or its name, place and stead, as such
Indemnifying Partys attorney-in fact in connection with the Merger Agreement,
and matters related thereto, including this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

2\. _Effectiveness_. This Agreement shall become effective on the Closing
Date and terminate on the date that no Escrow Fund remains in the Escrow
Account (each term as defined below).

3\. _Escrow Agent_. The parties hereto hereby designate and appoint the
Escrow Agent to serve in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions
of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as escrow agent in
accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.

4\. _Escrow Account_. Pursuant to _Section 3.4_ of the Merger
Agreement, Parent hereby deposits into escrow with the Escrow Agent the
Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount plus the Escrow Income (as defined below) are
collectively referred to as the " _Escrow Fund_ ". The Escrow Agent shall hold
and safeguard the Escrow Fund in a separate and distinct account,  in the name of [], as Escrow Agent for Parent and the Indemnifying Parties
(the " _Escrow Account_ "). The Escrow Agent shall treat the Escrow Fund as
trust funds in accordance with the terms of [ _Section 10.3_ , _Section 10.4_
and _Section 10.5_] of the Merger Agreement and the terms hereof. Any
dividends, income, interest, gains or other distributions earned with respect
to the Escrow Amount (the " _Escrow Income_ ") shall be deemed a part of the
Escrow Fund and shall be distributed in accordance with _Section 7_ hereof.

 

5\. _No Liens_. The Escrow Fund shall not be subject to any lien, attachment,
trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any
Indemnifying Party or of any party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Escrow Fund shall be attached, garnished, or levied upon pursuant to
judicial process, or the delivery of the Escrow Fund shall be stayed or
enjoined by any arbitration decision or court order, or any arbitration
decision or court order shall be made or entered into affecting the Escrow
Fund, or any part thereof, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to
obey and comply with such arbitration decision or court order. In the event
the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any arbitration decision or court
order, it shall not be liable to any person, firm or corporation by reason of
such compliance, notwithstanding the subsequent reversal, modification,
annulment, or setting aside of such arbitration decision or court order.

6\. _Liabilities Secured by Escrow Amount_. The Escrow Fund shall, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, be held
as security for (a) the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties to indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against Losses pursuant to _Article
10_ and _Article 7_ of the Merger Agreement, (b) in the event the Additional
Payment Amount is a negative number, the payment of an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Additional Payment Amount to Parent pursuant to
_Section 3.6(c)(ii)_ of the Merger Agreement and (c) for obligations under
the Support Agreements.

 

7\. _Distribution of Escrow Fund; Release Dates_.

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall only disburse the Escrow Fund in the manner
provided in this _Section 7_ and  _Section 12_ upon receipt of (i) joint
written instructions of Parent and the Stockholders Representative (the "
_Joint Instruction_ ") substantially in the form of _Schedule I_ jointly
signed by their respective Authorized Signatories (as defined below) or (ii)
a final non-appealable court order from a court of competent jurisdiction
directing the distribution of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund. The
Stockholders Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to the Escrow Agent, contemporaneously with the delivery of any (A)
Joint Instructions or (B) a final, non-appealable court order directing the
distribution of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund, express instructions
with respect to the correct allocation of any released funds among the
Indemnifying Parties and Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
provide all information reasonably required by the Escrow Agent necessary to
make the distributions required pursuant to this Agreement (including, without
limitation, causing the Exchange Agent to provide any information in its
possession). Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each of Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a form
setting its respective authorized signatories substantially in the form of
_Schedule II-A_ and _Schedule II-B_ hereto, respectively (any such
authorized signatory, an " _Authorized Signatory_ "), and the parties

 



2  may update such form by providing written notice to the Escrow Agent and the
other party hereto.

 

(b) In the event the Additional Payment Amount is a negative number, Parent
and the Stockholders Representative shall promptly deliver a Joint
Instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to
Parent an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the absolute value of the
Additional Payment Amount.

 

(c) If any claim pursuant to _Section 10.2_ of the Merger Agreement becomes a
Payable Claim pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall promptly deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to release to the applicable Indemnified Party an
amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of such Payable Claim.

(d) Promptly after the day falling nine (9) months after the Closing Date
(such day, the " _Initial Release Date_ "), Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to release to the Payment Parties their respective Pro Rata
Portions of an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the excess, if any, of



     | (A) | US$30,000,000 
---|---|--- 
     |  | _over_ 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of the Losses set forth
in Claim Notices with respect to the Unresolved Claims as of the Initial
Release Date; (ii) all amounts released by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
this Agreement prior to the Initial Release Date; and (iii) the aggregate
amount of any Payable Claims as of the Initial Release Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such amounts (whether set forth in Claim Notices for
Unresolved Claims, released by the Escrow Agent or with respect to Payable
Claims) which relate to Claims made pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(iv)_ and
_Article 7_ of the Merger Agreement, shall only be included in this subsection
(B) (and thus deducted from the amounts to be released on the Initial Release
Date) to the extent they do not exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate. 
---|---|--- 
 

(e) Promptly after the day falling on the second anniversary of the Closing
Date (such day, the " _Final Release Date_ "), Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to release to the Payment Parties their respective Pro Rata
Portions of an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the excess, if any, of



     | (A) | the remaining amount of the Escrow Fund as of the Final
Release Date 
---|---|--- 



     |  | _over_ 
---|---|--- 
 



3 forth in Claim Notices with respect to the Unresolved Claims as of the Final
Release Date and (ii) the aggregate amount of any Payable Claims as of
the Final Release Date. 
---|---|--- 

To the extent that any amount has been reserved and withheld from distribution
from the Escrow Fund on account of any Unresolved Claim as of the Final
Release Date and, thereafter, such Unresolved Claim is resolved in accordance
with the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
promptly deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release (A) to Parent, the amount of the Unresolved Claim to the
extent resolved as a Payable Claim, and (B) to the Payment Parties their
respective Pro Rata Portion of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x)
the amount theretofore reserved and withheld from distribution in respect of
such Unresolved Claim _over_ (y) the payment, if any, made pursuant to the
foregoing clause (A).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the
Merger Agreement, in the event that a joint written authorization executed by
an Authorized Signatory of Parent and an Authorized Signatory of the
Stockholders Representative is delivered instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse the Escrow Funds to any person, the Escrow Agent shall comply
with such joint written authorization.

8\. _Fees and Expenses_. Parent and the Stockholders Representative, on
behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, shall each pay 50% of the fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent set forth on _Schedule III_ hereto. The
provisions under this _Section 8_ shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Escrow Agent and any termination of this Agreement.

9\. _Several Liability of Parent and the Stockholders  Representative_. Each
of the obligation of Parent and/or the Stockholders Representative pursuant
to this Agreement, including this _Section 8_, is several but not joint.

 

10\. _Responsibilities of the Escrow Agent_. The acceptance by the Escrow
Agent of its duties under this Agreement is subject to the following terms
and conditions, which the parties to this Agreement hereby agree shall govern
and control with respect to such Escrow Agents rights, duties, liabilities
and immunities:

 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall administer the Escrow Fund in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not have any interest in the Escrow Fund, but shall
serve as escrow holder only and have possession thereof.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any Joint Instruction,
not only as to its due execution and the validity and effectiveness of its
provisions but also as to the truth and acceptability of any information
therein contained, which it, in good faith, reasonably believes to be genuine
and what it purports to be.

 



4 (d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for
any act done or step taken or omitted by it, or for any mistake of fact or
Law or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection
herewith, except for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or for any
action taken or omitted in bad faith. Parent (on the one hand) and the
Stockholders Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (on the
other hand), covenant and agree to, severally but not jointly, indemnify and
hold the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees
(collectively, the " _Escrow Agent Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against
50% of any and all liabilities, losses, damages, fines, suits, actions,
demands, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable out-
of-pocket, incidental expenses, legal fees and expenses (" _Losses_ ") (other
than Losses that result from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
for any action taken or omitted in bad faith by the Escrow Agent) that may be
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, the Escrow Agent Indemnitees or
any of them for following any instruction or direction upon which the Escrow
Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no
event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential
loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of such loss or damage
and regardless of the form of action.

(e) The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any notice of a claim, or demand
with respect thereto, or any waiver, modification, amendment, termination or
rescission of this Agreement, unless such notice is in writing and delivered
in accordance with the terms of  _Section 13_ hereof.

(f) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days prior
written notice thereof to Parent and the Stockholders Representative, but
such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Escrow Agent
mutually agreed to by Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall have
been appointed and shall have accepted such appointment in writing. Parent
and the Stockholders Representative, together, shall have the right to remove
the Escrow Agent by giving at least ten (10) days prior written notice to the
Escrow Agent, specifying the date upon which such removal shall take effect.
In the event that an instrument of acceptance by a successor Escrow Agent
shall not have been delivered to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days
after the giving of a notice of resignation by the Escrow Agent, the
resigning Escrow Agent may, at the expense of the Stockholders
Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (on the one hand), and
Parent (on the other hand) (split equally), petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. Any
corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent in its individual
capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or
any corporation or association resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of
the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity
may be sold or otherwise transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Agreement without further act.

 



5 (g) In the event of the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent, upon
the termination of this Agreement or pursuant to _Section 9(f)_, the Escrow
Agent shall render to Parent and the Stockholders Representative an account
in writing of the property constituting the Escrow Fund and all
distributions therefrom. In the event of the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 9(f)_, the Escrow Agent hereby agrees that,
upon receiving joint written instructions from Parent and the Stockholders
Representative, it shall turn over and deliver to any successor Escrow Agent
all of the Escrow Fund and other amounts held by it pursuant to this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of such written instructions and render the
accounting required by the first sentence of this _Section 9(g)_.

(h) The agreements set forth in this _Section 9_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent and the payment of all amounts hereunder.

11\. _Investment of Escrow Fund_.

(a) The Escrow Amount shall be invested and reinvested by the Escrow Agent
upon the receipt of joint written instructions provided by the Parent and the
Stockholders Representative in any one or more Permitted Investments from
time to time as maturities occur. For all purposes of and under this
Agreement, the term " _Permitted Investments_ " shall include:



     | (A) | direct obligations of the United States of America; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal
and interest; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (C) | such other investments as Parent and the Stockholders
Representative may from time to time mutually agree upon in writing executed
and delivered by Parent and the Stockholders Representative to the
Escrow Agent. 
---|---|--- 

(b) In the absence of joint written instructions, funds shall be invested as
set forth in clause (A) above.

(c) The Escrow Agent may liquidate any investments made hereunder at such time
as it shall deem necessary to make payments in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss
incurred as a result of any investment or liquidation made by it in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

 

12\. _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Stockholders Representative agree that, for
purposes of United States federal and other taxes based on income, the
Indemnifying Parties shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund and that
the Indemnifying

 



6  Parties shall report the income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from,
the Escrow Fund as its income, in the taxable year or years in which such
income is properly includible and pay any taxes attributable thereto. The
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Indemnifying Parties within ten (10) days of
the end of each calendar quarter their respective Pro Rata Portions of an
amount of cash equal to the produce of (i) the income earned on the Escrow
Fund for the prior calendar quarter and (ii) fifty percent (50%).

(b) Prior to the date hereof, each of Parent, the Indemnifying Parties and
the Stockholders Representative shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully
executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or W-8, properly completed and
signed, and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may
reasonably request.

(c) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount distributed or released from the Escrow Fund all taxes which may be
required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of applicable tax Law.
All such withheld amounts shall be treated as having been delivered to the
party entitled to the amount distributed or released in respect of which such
tax has been deducted or withheld.

13\. _Notices_. All Joint Instructions, notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile

14\. _Confidentiality_. The Escrow Agent shall not disclose to any person
other than Parent or the Stockholders Representative any information,
documents, accounts or other materials concerning this Agreement, the Escrow
Fund or the Escrow Account, including, without limitation, disclosure of any
direct or indirect beneficial interests in or dealings with the Escrow Fund or
Escrow Account or the exercise or performance (or proposed exercise or
performance) of any power or discretion or duty of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent may make such disclosures concerning the Escrow Fund or the
Escrow Account: (A) as may be

 



8  properly required of it by applicable Law or any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority, it being expressly provided that
this power shall include (1) any disclosure required under any legislation or
regulations governing transactions in securities, any rules of any stock
exchange or market or banking or securities regulatory authority in any place
which the whole or any part of the Escrow Fund is held directly or indirectly
or is situated from time to time; and (2) any disclosure which it may consider
to be necessary or desirable in the interests of the Escrow Fund or the Escrow
Account to satisfy any reporting obligations required by applicable Law; (B)
for the purpose of obtaining legal or other advice in relation to the
performance of its duties and exercise of its powers; (C) to protect it from
civil, criminal or regulatory liability or sanction; or (D) to perform its
duties and to exercise its powers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

15\. _Amendment_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived
if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the
case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a
waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

16\. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and
unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have
any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication).

17\. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (i)
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement; and (ii) is not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

18\. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

19\. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand,
action, or cause of action (i) arising under this Agreement or (ii) in any way
connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the parties in
respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in each
case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract,
tort, equity, or

 



9  otherwise. Each party hereto hereby further agrees and consents that any
such claim, demand, action, or cause of action shall be decided by court trial
without a jury and that the parties may file a copy of this Agreement with
any court as written evidence of the consent of the parties to the waiver of
their right to trial by jury.

 

20\. _Specific Performance; Other Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any court in the State of Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

21\. _Governing Law_. All provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of Laws thereof.

22\. _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

23.  _Assignment_. No party hereto may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of
each other party hereto.

 

24\. _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal Law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business
entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will
ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal
entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority
to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. Parent and the
Stockholders Representative each agrees to provide all such information and
documentation as to themselves as requested by the Escrow Agent to ensure
compliance with federal Law.
