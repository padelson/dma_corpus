of conduct or failure or delay of any Party in exercising or enforcing any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right, remedy or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power. </P>

provision of this Agreement by such Party, the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches hereof and to specifically enforce
